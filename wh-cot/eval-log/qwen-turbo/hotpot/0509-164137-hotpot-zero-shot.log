Question:What years did Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and other leaders of fthe Medallin Cartel operate in Boliva, Colombia, Central America, Peru, the United States, Canada, and Europe?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, also known as "Popeye," was a key leader of the Medellin Cartel, which was active primarily in Colombia during the 1980s. However, the cartel's influence extended beyond Colombia, operating in various regions including:

1. Bolivia: Although not its primary base, the Medellin Cartel had some presence and drug trafficking operations in Bolivia.
2. Colombia: As mentioned, the cartel's stronghold was in Colombia.
3. Central America: The cartel smuggled drugs through countries like Panama, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
4. Peru: The Medellin Cartel was involved in the drug trade in Peru, using it as a transit point for their shipments.
5. United States: The cartel's main market was the U.S., where they were responsible for a significant portion of the cocaine supply.
6. Canada: They also had operations in Canada, particularly in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.
7. Europe: The Medellin Cartel had extensive operations in Europe, with a focus on countries like Spain, Italy, West Germany, and the United Kingdom.

So, the years of operation for the Medellin Cartel under Gacha's leadership, particularly in these locations, would be around the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, before the group's decline and eventual dismantlement due to law enforcement actions and internal power struggles.
