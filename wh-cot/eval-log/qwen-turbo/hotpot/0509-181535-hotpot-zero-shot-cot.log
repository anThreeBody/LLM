Question:Seven years before the opening of the Brewer Fieldhouse in Columbia, Missouri, where was Chester Brewer working as head football coach and head basketball coach?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the answer to this question, we need to determine when the Brewer Fieldhouse opened and then subtract seven years to find out where Chester Brewer was working before that.

The Brewer Fieldhouse in Columbia, Missouri, opened in 1928. Now, let's subtract seven years:

1928 - 7 = 1921

Chester Brewer would have been working at a location before 1921. However, without specific historical records or additional context, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly where he was coaching at that time. We can only provide the general timeframe.

Answer: Chester Brewer was likely working as head football coach and head basketball coach at a university or college in the United States in 1921, but the exact institution is not provided without further research.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
1921 at a university or college in the United States (specific institution not provided).

Question:In what city was the second bowl game to air on all the "big four" television networks played?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The "big four" television networks in the United States are ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. Bowl games that air on multiple networks typically occur during college football bowl season, particularly the major bowl games like the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. The first time all four networks aired a bowl game simultaneously was the 1993 Rose Bowl, which was played in Pasadena, California.

However, to determine if this was the second such event, we would need to look at the history of these networks airing bowl games together. The 1993 Rose Bowl was indeed the first, so the second game would have occurred after that.

Unfortunately, without specific data on subsequent years, I cannot provide an exact city for the second game. But it's likely that another major bowl game with high viewership took place in a different city, also in Pasadena or another well-known bowl location like Miami (for the Orange Bowl) or New Orleans (for the Sugar Bowl).

Answer: The specific city for the second bowl game to air on all the "big four" networks is not immediately available, but it would likely be one of the traditional bowl game locations like Pasadena, Miami, or New Orleans. Further research would be needed to pinpoint the exact year and city.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
Pasadena, Miami, or New Orleans (without specific year information).

Question:What years did Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and other leaders of fthe Medallin Cartel operate in Boliva, Colombia, Central America, Peru, the United States, Canada, and Europe?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, also known as "Popeye," was a key leader of the Medellín Cartel, which was active during the 1980s. Gacha's operations were widespread, and he was particularly notorious for his involvement in drug trafficking and control of the cocaine trade. The cartel's activities extended across several countries, including:

1. Bolivia: Although not their primary base, the Medellín Cartel had some presence in Bolivia, where they smuggled drugs.
2. Colombia: This was the cartel's home base, where they were most active.
3. Central America (specifically, Panama): They used the region for drug trafficking routes and money laundering.
4. Peru: The cartel smuggled drugs through Peru and sometimes operated there.
5. United States: The Medellín Cartel's main market was the U.S., where they controlled a significant portion of the cocaine supply.
6. Canada: They also had operations in Canada, exporting drugs to the North American market.
7. Europe: The cartel had extensive operations in Europe, particularly in Western European countries.

So, the years of operation for Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and other Medellín Cartel leaders in these regions would be primarily the 1980s, with peak activity around the mid-to-late 1980s. However, it's important to note that the cartel's influence continued even after Gacha's arrest in 1989, but its power began to decline following his capture.
Therefore, the answer is

the 1980s, with a focus on the mid-to-late 1980s.

Question:Does Jimmy Barnes have more hits, both solo and in a group, than Yang Seung-ho has with his group?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Jimmy Barnes is an Australian rock singer known for his solo career as well as his time with the band Cold Chisel. Yang Seung-ho is a South Korean singer, primarily associated with his group iKON.

To determine if Jimmy Barnes has more hits than Yang Seung-ho with his group, we would need to compare the total number of successful songs or chart-topping hits for each artist. Unfortunately, without specific data on their discographies, it's impossible to provide an exact comparison.

However, considering Jimmy Barnes' long career and the popularity of Cold Chisel in Australia, it's likely that he has had more hits overall, including both solo and group material. Yang Seung-ho and iKON are also popular but might not have the same level of international recognition or longevity as Barnes and Cold Chisel.

Answer: Based on general knowledge and assuming Jimmy Barnes' extensive career, it's probable that he has more hits, but without specific numbers, we can't definitively say.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
it is likely, but without exact data, we cannot confirm.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The question asks for the lead singer of Collective Soul who is also a record producer from Stockbridge, Georgia. The band Collective Soul is known for its lead vocalist, Shawn Mullins. However, it's important to note that Shawn Mullins is not primarily recognized as a record producer; he focuses more on singing.

This event likely refers to the establishment of an indigenous tribe with self-governance in the region during that time.

The "feud" you might be referring to could be the pursuit of justice and accountability for the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, which took place from 1933 to 1945. Wiesenthal's efforts were mainly in the years following the war, specifically from the late 1940s to the 1970s, when he worked to locate and bring to trial those responsible for Nazi crimes.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The man you are referring to is likely linked to the case of the "Westside Crips" gang, as Anthony "White Tony" Johnson was a prominent figure in that Los Angeles neighborhood. The individual you mention is often associated with the notorious gangster, Biggie Smalls (also known as The Notorious B.I.G.), whose real name was Christopher George Latore Wallace. Biggie was involved in several violent crimes during his career, but it's important to note that the exact number of unsolved murders he is suspected of alongside his younger brother, Tjay (also known as T.I. or Trae Dom) is not definitively known. Tjay has not been directly linked to any high-profile unsolved murders.

However, Biggie is primarily known for two unsolved murders: the 1997 death of Tupac Shakur and the 1999 murder of himself. Tjay has not been publicly implicated in these cases. If you're asking about other potential crimes, it's typically the focus on Biggie's involvement, as Tjay's criminal history is separate and more recent.

So, based on the information available, we can say that Biggie Smalls is suspected of at least two unsolved murders, while Tjay's direct connection to unsolved murders is not well-documented.
Therefore, the answer is

two unsolved murders.

Question:This film is an adaption of a Jacques Offenbach's opera that was written by a Hungarian British screenwriter?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The question mentions an adaptation of a Jacques Offenbach's opera, and the screenwriter is described as Hungarian British. The most well-known Hungarian-British screenwriter is probably Emeric Pressburger, who co-wrote films with Michael Powell. However, Offenbach's operas are typically associated with the French theater, and while there might be some adaptations, it's not common for a British-Hungarian screenwriter to have written one directly.

Given this information, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific film without more details. However, if there's a notable example, it could be a lesser-known or obscure adaptation. If you need a speculative answer, we could say:

Answer: One possible film that fits this description is "The Tales of Hoffmann," which has been adapted into various forms over the years, including a 1951 film directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. While Pressburger wasn't a direct adaptation of Offenbach's original work, he did contribute to a film based on the opera. However, it's important to note that this might not be the only or the most fitting answer without further context.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
"The Tales of Hoffmann" (1951), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The question mentions a Southern European island country and an airline pilot who flew the CASA-212-200 Aviocar. To identify the correct answer, we need to consider countries in Southern Europe that are known for having airlines and could potentially be home to an island.

CASA-212-200 Aviocar is a small turboprop aircraft, often used for regional flights or short-haul operations. Islands like Malta, Greece, or Cyprus are known for their aviation industry, but without specific additional information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact country.

Given the retirement in 2008 for health reasons, it's possible that the country might have a smaller population or a more leisure-focused aviation scene. Malta, being a small island nation with a strong aviation history, fits this description.
