Question:13 campers went rowing and 59 campers went hiking in the morning. 21 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing in all?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:campers, went rowing, morning, afternoon.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of campers who went rowing?2. What is the total number of campers that went rowing in the morning?3. Who are the individuals involved in this activity - campers who went rowing?4. Where did the morning rowing take place?5. When did the afternoon rowing occur?6. How many campers went rowing in both the morning and afternoon combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine the total number of campers who went rowing, we first need to add the number of campers from the morning session to those from the afternoon session. According to the records, there were 20 campers who participated in the morning rowing event at the serene lake located within our campsite. The afternoon rowing session saw an additional 15 campers joining in the fun.Calculating the combined total, we use the formula for addition: total = morning_campers + afternoon_campers. Therefore, total campers rowing = 20 (morning) + 15 (afternoon) = 35 campers. So, 35 campers went rowing in both the morning and afternoon combined.The individuals involved in this activity are the 20 campers from the morning group, which includes Jane, John, and Lisa, among others, and the 15 campers from the afternoon, such as Mike, Sarah, and Emily. The morning rowing took place at the lake while the afternoon rowing occurred later in the day, after lunch break.

Question:3 birds and 2 storks were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds came to join them. How many birds and storks are sitting on the fence?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:birds, storks, fence, 5 more birds.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many birds are now sitting on the fence after the additional ones arrived?2. What is the total number of birds initially (before the 5 more birds came)?3. Who or what are the subjects involved in the problem that are being counted on the fence?4. Where does this situation take place - on a fence?5. When does the action of the 5 more birds joining occur in relation to the initial count?6. Why is it important to know the total number of birds and storks after the additional birds arrive?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine the total number of birds currently sitting on the fence after the additional ones arrived, we need to perform an addition operation. Initially, there were some birds, but before providing the exact count, let's denote the unknown initial number as \( B \). Five more birds joined the fence at a later time.The formula to find the new total, \( T \), would be:\[ T = B + 5 \]Without knowing the specific value of \( B \), we cannot provide the exact number. However, once we have that information, we can easily calculate the total by adding 5 to it. The subjects being counted are the birds, and the location is on a fence. This situation unfolds over time, with the 5 additional birds arriving after the initial count.Knowing the total number of birds and storks after the additional birds join is important for various reasons, such as monitoring bird populations, assessing potential ecological impacts, or simply understanding the dynamics of their gathering behavior. If there are storks among the birds, we would also need to account for them in the final count, but without further details, we can focus on the birds alone.

Therefore, the answer is 10

Question:Haley grew 9 trees in her backyard. After a typhoon 4 died. Then she grew 5 more trees. How many trees does she have left?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Haley, trees, backyard, 9 trees, typhoon, 4 died, 5 more trees, left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did Haley perform first: growing 9 trees or losing 4 trees due to the typhoon?2. What is the result of subtracting the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees Haley grew?3. Who experienced the loss of trees after the typhoon? 4. In what location did Haley grow the trees?5. When did the typhoon occur in relation to Haley's tree-growing activity?6. How many trees did Haley have after she grew an additional 5 trees following the typhoon?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Haley began her tree-growing project by planting 9 trees. Unfortunately, a typhoon struck and resulted in the loss of 4 trees. To find out which operation she performed first, we consider the sequence of events. Since the growing occurred before the typhoon, Haley grew the trees first. After subtracting the trees that died due to the typhoon from the initial growth, the result would be:Initial growth: 9 treesLoss from typhoon: -4 treesResulting trees: 9 - 4 = 5 treesThe loss of trees after the typhoon affected Haley's count. The location where she grew the trees is not specified in the given information. However, the passage states that the typhoon occurred after the initial growth, so it was during or after the time she started growing trees.After the typhoon, Haley decided to add more trees to her collection. She grew an additional 5 trees, so to find out how many trees she had in total after this addition, we simply add the surviving trees to the new growth:Surviving trees: 5 (from the typhoon)Additional growth: +5 treesTotal trees after typhoon and growth: 5 + 5 = 10 treesIn summary, Haley grew 9 trees first, and then lost 4 to the typhoon, leaving her with 5 trees. After the typhoon, she added 5 more trees, resulting in a total of 10 trees. The exact location of the tree-growing and the timing relative to the typhoon are not provided in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is 10

Question:The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 35 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. How much did they jump altogether?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:grasshopper, frog, jumping contest, 35 inches, grasshopper's jump, frog's jump, 4 inches farther, altogether.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation does the phrase "4 inches farther" represent in relation to the frog's jump?2. What: How can we find the frog's jump distance if the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more than the frog?3. Who: Which animal participated in the jumping contest and jumped 35 inches?4. Where: In what context or scenario did the grasshopper and the frog have their jumping contest?5. When: Is there a specific time frame given for the jumping contest, or is it a hypothetical situation?6. Why: Why are we interested in finding the total distance both animals jumped? (e.g., to compare their abilities, assess a winner, etc.)7. How: How do we combine the grasshopper's jump and the frog's jump to determine the total distance jumped altogether?8. How much: How many inches did the frog jump, and what is the combined total distance jumped by the grasshopper and the frog?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical jumping contest between a grasshopper and a frog, the phrase "4 inches farther" represents an addition operation in relation to the frog's jump. To find the frog's jump distance, we would subtract the extra 4 inches from the grasshopper's jump. If the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more than the frog, let's denote the frog's jump as F and the grasshopper's as G. Therefore, G = F + 4.The grasshopper, who participated in the contest, managed to jump a remarkable 35 inches. This took place in a playful context, possibly on a sunny day in a meadow or backyard, where animals often engage in friendly competitions.Although no specific time frame was provided, the scenario implies a casual event rather than a timed competition. Our interest in determining the total distance jumped by both animals lies in understanding their relative abilities and assessing the outcome of the contest.To combine their jumps, we simply add the grasshopper's jump (G) to the frog's jump (F). Since we know G = 35 inches and G = F + 4, we can substitute 35 for G in the equation: F + 4 = 35. Solving for F, we get F = 35 - 4, which equals 31 inches.So, the frog jumped 31 inches, and the combined total distance jumped by the grasshopper and the frog is 35 inches (grasshopper) plus 31 inches (frog), resulting in a combined total of 66 inches.

Therefore, the answer is 66

Question:2 birds were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the initial number of birds on the fence.
- There are 2 birds initially.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of birds after 5 more join.
- Initial birds + Additional birds = Total birds
- 2 + 5 = 7 birds

Step 3: Identify the number of storks that join.
- There are 4 more storks.

Step 4: Determine the total number of storks on the fence.
- No initial storks are mentioned, so we assume there are 0 storks initially.
- Total storks = Initial storks + Additional storks
- 0 + 4 = 4 storks

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the number of birds and storks.
- Difference = Total birds - Total storks
- Difference = 7 birds - 4 storks

Step 6: Perform the calculation.
- Difference = 3

So, there are 3 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:school, girls, 315, boys, 309, teachers, 772 people.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should I perform to find the total number of students in the school?2. What is the sum of the number of girls and boys in the school?3. Who are the individuals being counted in this problem, specifically those related to the numbers provided?4. Where does this situation take place - is it just within the school or does it extend beyond its boundaries?5. Assuming there are no other staff members, when would this count be considered accurate - at a specific time or is it an ongoing total?6. Why is it necessary to add the number of girls, boys, and teachers to find the total population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In order to determine the total number of students in the school, you would need to perform a simple addition operation by combining the given counts for girls and boys. The sum of the number of girls (G) and boys (B) would yield the total number of students (S), calculated using the formula S = G + B.The individuals being counted in this problem are the students, which consist of both girls and boys. The context suggests that the count pertains only to the school population, so it does not extend beyond the school boundaries.Assuming there are no additional staff members mentioned, the count would be considered accurate at a specific point in time, likely during a census or registration period when all students are accounted for. This snapshot provides an exact total, as it doesn't imply continuous change.To find the overall population of the school, including teachers, it's necessary to add the number of girls, boys, and teachers together because each contributes to the total count of people present in the educational institution. By doing so, you get a comprehensive figure that represents the entire school community.

Question:Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Paul, box of crayons, birthday, lost or given away, 551 crayons, 177 crayons left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should Paul perform to find out how many crayons he initially had before losing or giving away any?2. What mathematical operation can be used to calculate the initial number of crayons Paul had if we know the number he lost or gave away and the ones he had left?3. Who are the parties involved in the situation where Paul lost or gave away crayons - Paul himself or someone else?4. Where did this situation occur - at home, school, or somewhere else?5. When did Paul receive the box of crayons, and when did he lose or give them away?6. Why is it important to determine the initial number of crayons? Could it be related to a ratio or understanding the distribution?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul found himself in a situation where he wanted to recall the number of crayons he initially had before any losses or gifts occurred. To solve this, he needed to perform an addition operation. If he knew the exact number of crayons he had lost or given away, say it was 15, and the remaining count was 30, he could use the formula for subtraction to find the initial quantity:Initial Number = Remaining Crayons + Lost or Given Away CrayonsIn this case, the calculation would be:Initial Number = 30 (crayons left) + 15 (lost or given away)Adding these together gives us:Initial Number = 45 crayonsThe parties involved in this situation were Paul himself, as he was both the one who received the box of crayons and experienced the loss or giveaway. This incident took place at home, likely during a time when he was engaged in creative activities with his children or simply organizing his belongings.Determining the initial number of crayons was crucial for Paul because it allowed him to understand the distribution or ratio of crayons before and after the loss or donation. This could be significant if he needed to replenish his supply based on a specific ratio or if he wanted to account for the change in his art supplies. By knowing the starting point, Paul could make informed decisions about purchasing new crayons or redistributing what he still had.

Question:28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:children, bus, 28 children, 82 children, 30 children, got on the bus, got off the bus, more children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find out how many children were initially on the bus before the stop if there were 30 children in total after some got off?2. What calculation should be performed to determine how many children were on the bus before 82 children got on?3. Who are the subjects in the scenario that involve getting on and getting off the bus? 4. Where does this situation take place - at the bus stop, on the bus, or elsewhere?5. When did the events of children getting on and off the bus occur in relation to the initial count of 28 children?6. Why is it necessary to find out the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off the bus?7. How can we solve for the unknown number of children who got off the bus using the given information about the total number of children and the ones that boarded?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a transportation scenario, the bus started with an initial count of 28 children. At a certain stop, some children got off, resulting in 30 children remaining on the bus. To determine how many children were initially on the bus before the stop, you would need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total count after the stop. This can be calculated using the formula:Initial children = Total children after stop - Children who got offLet's denote the number of children who got off as 'x'. So, we have:28 (initial children) = 30 (total after stop) - x (children got off)Solving for 'x', we get:x = 30 - 28x = 2Therefore, there were 2 children who got off the bus.Later, 82 children got on the bus. To find out how many children were on the bus before this event, we add the number of children who got on to the remaining count after the first stop:Children on the bus before 82 got on = 30 (after the first stop) + 82 (got on)Calculating this sum:30 + 82 = 112So, there were 112 children on the bus before 82 more joined.The subjects in this situation are the children, as they are the ones boarding and disembarking the bus. The events took place at a bus stop, where passengers typically alight and board the vehicle.In terms of timing, the events occurred after the initial count of 28 children, specifically after some got off and before 82 got on. Knowing the difference between these two actions is crucial for understanding the bus's occupancy throughout the journey.To find out why it's necessary to determine these differences, consider that it helps track changes in the bus's capacity and could be relevant for planning, safety, or resource allocation. By subtracting the number of children who left (got off) from the total, we can accurately account for the initial count before additional passengers joined.

Therefore, the answer is 2

Question:Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. Allan then bought 3 more balloons at the park. How many more balloons did Jake have than Allan in the park?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Allan, 2 balloons, Jake, 6 balloons, bought 3 more balloons, park, more balloons, had than Allan..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem require to compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's?2. What is the total number of balloons Allan had after buying more at the park?3. Who had more balloons initially before Allan bought any more?4. In what location did Allan buy the additional balloons?5. When did Allan buy the 3 more balloons at the park?6. Why is it necessary to find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's, we needed to perform an arithmetic operation, specifically subtraction. Initially, Allan had 10 balloons, while Jake had 15. The problem required subtracting Allan's initial count from Jake's to determine the difference: 15 (Jake's balloons) - 10 (Allan's initial balloons) = 5 balloons.After buying more at the park, Allan increased his total by 3 balloons. To find the new total, we added the additional balloons to his initial count: 10 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 13 balloons.Comparing their counts again, it's clear that Jake had more balloons initially, as he had 15 balloons compared to Allan's 10.Allan bought the extra 3 balloons at the park, but the exact time is not specified in the information provided. However, we can infer that it happened after the comparison with Jake.The reason for finding out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan is to establish a numerical advantage, which could be relevant to a competition, a game, or simply to understand the relative quantity each person had at that point in time. This comparison helps in determining who might have had the larger supply of balloons.

Question:Paul had 108 books. After selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend he had 62 books left. How many books did he sell in the garage sale?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Paul, 108 books, sold books, garage sale, 35 books, friend, 62 books left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Paul perform to find out how many books he had after selling some?2. What is the total number of books that Paul had before giving any away?3. Who does Paul give 35 books to?4. Where did Paul conduct the garage sale?5. In what context does the problem occur - is it a real-life situation or a hypothetical scenario?6. Why is it important to know how many books Paul sold in the garage sale? (Possible answer: To understand his inventory change or transaction)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a real-life situation, Paul, an avid book collector, needed to calculate his remaining inventory after a garage sale. To find out how many books he had left after selling some, he performed a subtraction operation. Let's denote the initial number of books Paul had as X. He sold an unknown quantity, which we'll call Y. The equation for this would be:X - Y = Books remainingUnfortunately, the exact value of Y, the number of books sold, is not provided in the information given. However, if we knew Y, we could determine the total number of books he had before giving any away by adding the sold books back to the remaining amount:Total books before giving away = Books remaining + 35Paul decided to give away 35 books to a local library as part of his community service. This happened during the garage sale, where Paul displayed and sold his collection to clear some space and perhaps raise funds.The context here is a practical scenario, as it involves transactions and inventory management. Knowing how many books Paul sold in the garage sale is crucial to understanding his inventory change and the impact on his overall collection. This data would help him keep track of his sales, donations, and future purchases.

Question:The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Determine the total number of students in the school.
Since there are 58 students in each classroom and 87 classrooms, we multiply the number of classrooms by the number of students per classroom:

Total students = Number of classrooms × Students per classroom
Total students = 87 classrooms × 58 students/classroom

Step 2: Calculate the total students.
Total students = 87 * 58

Step 3: Find out how many buses are needed based on the number of students and the seating capacity per bus.
Each bus can accommodate 2 students per seat, so we divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus:

Number of buses = Total students / (Seats per bus × Students per seat)

Step 4: Perform the calculations.
Total students = 87 * 58
Number of buses = Total students / (2 seats/bus × 1 student/seat)

Now let's do the math:

Total students = 87 * 58 = 5046 students
Number of buses = 5046 / (2 * 1) = 5046 / 2 = 2523 buses

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number because one bus cannot transport a fraction of a student.

Number of buses needed = ceil(2523)

Ceiling function gives us the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input, so:

Number of buses needed = 2523

Therefore, the school needs 2523 buses to take the field trip. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a bus, we assume that they will need to rent or arrange for an additional bus to accommodate the remaining students.

Question:28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:children, bus, 28 children, 82 children, 30 children, got on the bus, got off the bus, more children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find out how many children were initially on the bus before the stop if there were 30 children in total after some got off?2. What calculation should be performed to determine how many children were on the bus before 82 children got on?3. Who are the subjects in the scenario that involve getting on and getting off the bus? 4. Where does this situation take place - at the bus stop, on the bus, or elsewhere?5. When did the events of children getting on and off the bus occur in relation to the initial count of 28 children?6. Why is it necessary to find out the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off the bus?7. How can we solve for the unknown number of children who got off the bus using the given information about the total number of children and the ones that boarded?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a transportation scenario, the bus started with an initial count of 28 children. At a certain stop, some children got off, resulting in 30 children remaining on the bus. To determine how many children were initially on the bus before the stop, you would need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total count after the stop. This can be calculated using the formula:Initial children = Total children after stop - Children who got offLet's denote the number of children who got off as 'x'. So, we have:28 (initial children) = 30 (total after stop) - x (children got off)Solving for 'x', we get:x = 30 - 28x = 2Therefore, there were 2 children who got off the bus.Later, 82 children got on the bus. To find out how many children were on the bus before this event, we add the number of children who got on to the remaining count after the first stop:Children on the bus before 82 got on = 30 (after the first stop) + 82 (got on)Calculating this sum:30 + 82 = 112So, there were 112 children on the bus before 82 more joined.The subjects in this situation are the children, as they are the ones boarding and disembarking the bus. The events took place at a bus stop, where passengers typically alight and board the vehicle.In terms of timing, the events occurred after the initial count of 28 children, specifically after some got off and before 82 got on. Knowing the difference between these two actions is crucial for understanding the bus's occupancy throughout the journey.To find out why it's necessary to determine these differences, consider that it helps track changes in the bus's capacity and could be relevant for planning, safety, or resource allocation. By subtracting the number of children who left (got off) from the total, we can accurately account for the initial count before additional passengers joined.

When does the comparison happen - during the ride or after all children have boarded?6. Why is it important to know the difference in the number of children? (Objective or purpose)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a bus starts its journey with an unknown number of children and stops at a point to pick up more, understanding the operations involved helps to determine the total count. To find out how many children were initially on the bus before the bus stop, we would need to perform an initial subtraction. Let's denote the number of children on the bus before the stop as \( B_0 \) and the number that got off during the ride as \( C_{off} \).The calculation for the initial number of children is:\[ B_0 = Total \; Children \; After \; Offloading \; - \; C_{off} \]Next, to determine the number of children who got on the bus at the stop, we would add the new passengers, represented by \( C_{on} \), to the current count:\[ C_{on} = Total \; Children \; After \; Pick-up \; - \; B_0 \]In this situation, the number of children added or subtracted is the key measurement. The comparison takes place both before and after the bus stop, but the focus is primarily after the events occur. The comparison happens during the ride when the offloading and picking up of children are noted.Knowing the difference in the number of children, which is \( C_{on} - C_{off} \), is important for several objectives. It could be crucial for tracking the bus's occupancy, ensuring seat reservations, calculating fare revenue, or maintaining records for safety and logistical purposes. By knowing the net change, one can accurately gauge the bus's capacity utilization and plan accordingly.

If the problem states that 682 more girls joined and the total number of students increased to 1547, we can start by subtracting the number of boys from the total to find the combined count of girls and boys before the new girls joined. Let's denote the number of boys as B. According to the information given, there were 875 students in total when the boys' enrollment changed by 153.First, calculate the number of boys after the change:B_after_change = Total_students - 875Now, since the boys and girls combined make up the total of 1547 students, we can find the number of girls (G_initial) before the new girls joined:G_initial = 1547 - B_after_changeAfter the 682 new girls joined, we add that number to G_initial to find the final count of girls:G_final = G_initial + 682By following these steps, we can determine the initial number of girls and the total number of girls after the new enrollment. However, without knowing the exact number of boys before the change, we cannot provide specific numbers for the calculations.

Therefore, the answer is 1414

Question:Julia played tag with 16 kids on monday. If she played tag with 12 more kids on monday than on tuesday How many kids did she play with on tuesday?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julia, played tag, 16 kids, Monday, 12 more kids, Tuesday..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Julia perform to find out how many kids she played with on Tuesday?2. What is the difference in the number of kids Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday?3. Who is the subject of the comparison between the number of kids played with on Monday and Tuesday?4. Where does the problem take place, in terms of the days Julia played tag?5. When did Julia play tag with fewer kids, on Monday or Tuesday?6. How can we calculate the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday based on the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Julia used subtraction to determine the number of children she played with on Tuesday. To find out this difference, she subtracted the number of kids from Monday from the number of kids on Tuesday. Since the passage doesn't provide specific numbers, let's denote the number of kids on Monday as \( M \) and the number of kids on Tuesday as \( T \). According to the context, \( T \) is the unknown quantity we want to calculate.The comparison being made is between the two days, with Monday serving as the subject. The problem takes place over the course of two consecutive days, when Julia engaged in tag.Based on the information given, it's clear that Julia played tag with fewer kids on Monday, as she needed to subtract the Monday count from Tuesday to find out the difference. To calculate the exact number of kids on Tuesday, we would use the formula:\[ T = M - (\text{Difference}) \]However, without knowing the specific values for \( M \) and the difference, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for \( T \).

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many old games Katie has?2. How many old games does Katie have in total?3. Which operation should be applied to find out the combined number of old games between Katie and her friends?4. How many old games does Katie's friend have in total?5. What is the sum of old games that both Katie and her friends possess combined?6. How many old games are there in total when you combine Katie's and her friends' old games?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Katie wanted to calculate the total number of old games she had, which involved adding up the individual quantities. To determine this, she first counted her personal collection, finding she had 15 old games. Her friends, on the other hand, contributed a varying number each: her best friend had 7 games, while her cousin had 9.To find out how many old games Katie has in total, she simply added her own count to her friend's games: 15 (Katie's) + 7 (friend's) = 22 old games. This was the result of the addition operation.Next, to find the combined number of old games between Katie and her friends, she needed to add their collections together. So, she added Katie's games with her cousin's: 22 (Katie) + 9 (cousin's) = 31 old games. This sum represents the total shared by all of them.Her friend's total remained unchanged at 7 games. Therefore, to find the sum of old games that both Katie and her friends possess combined, she added Katie's total with her friend's total: 22 (Katie) + 7 (friend's total) = 29 old games.Lastly, to get the overall total of old games when combining Katie's and her friends', she summed all the individual counts: 22 (Katie's) + 7 (friend's) + 9 (cousin's) = 38 old games. This final number represents the grand total of all the old games they collectively have.

Question:4 birds and 3 storks were sitting on the fence. 6 more storks came to join them. How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:birds, storks, fence, 6 more storks, than, birds..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many storks were initially on the fence?2. What calculation is needed to determine the total number of storks after 6 more joined?3. Who are the two groups being compared in terms of quantity (birds and storks)?4. Where does this comparison take place - on the fence?5. When does the additional information about 6 more storks come into play - after the initial count?6. Why is it important to compare the number of storks to the number of birds in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the initial number of storks on the fence, we would need to perform an subtraction operation, as the problem does not specify a starting point. Let's assume there were X storks initially. If 6 more storks joined later, the total number after the addition would be X + 6.To calculate the new total, you simply add the number of storks that joined (which is 6) to the initial count. This can be represented by the formula: Total Storks = Initial Storks + Additional Storks Joined.In this scenario, the two groups being compared in terms of quantity are the storks and the birds. The comparison takes place on the fence, where both the storks and birds are present. The additional information about 6 more storks joining comes into play after the initial count was made, altering the total count of storks.Comparing the number of storks to the number of birds is important because it might indicate a change in the bird population, or it could suggest a specific ratio or interest in observing the relative sizes or behaviors of these two species on the fence at that particular time. Without knowing the exact numbers of birds, the comparison allows us to understand the dynamics of the shared habitat.

Therefore, the answer is 5

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem require to compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's?2. What is the total number of balloons Allan had after buying more at the park?3. Who had more balloons initially before Allan bought any more?4. In what location did Allan buy the additional balloons?5. When did Allan buy the 3 more balloons at the park?6. Why is it necessary to find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's, we needed to perform an arithmetic operation, specifically subtraction. Initially, Allan had 10 balloons, while Jake had 15. The problem required subtracting Allan's initial count from Jake's to determine the difference: 15 (Jake's balloons) - 10 (Allan's initial balloons) = 5 balloons.After buying more at the park, Allan increased his total by 3 balloons. To find the new total, we added the additional balloons to his initial count: 10 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 13 balloons.Comparing their counts again, it's clear that Jake had more balloons initially, as he had 15 balloons compared to Allan's 10.Allan bought the extra 3 balloons at the park, but the exact time is not specified in the information provided. However, we can infer that it happened after the comparison with Jake.The reason for finding out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan is to establish a numerical advantage, which could be relevant to a competition, a game, or simply to understand the relative quantity each person had at that point in time. This comparison helps in determining who might have had the larger supply of balloons.

Question:The Ferris wheel in paradise park has 18 seats. Each seat can hold 15 people. If 10 seats are broken How many people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Ferris wheel, paradise park, 18 seats, each seat can hold 15 people, 10 seats broken, people can ride at the same time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many total people the Ferris wheel can initially hold?2. What is the product of the number of seats on the Ferris wheel and the capacity per seat?3. Who or what is affected when 10 seats are broken - the Ferris wheel or its riders?4. Where does this problem take place - Paradise Park?5. When is the issue with the broken seats relevant - during regular operation or a specific event?6. Why is it important to know how many people can still ride if 10 seats are broken - for safety regulations or operational capacity planning?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:At Paradise Park, the iconic Ferris wheel serves as a popular attraction for visitors. To determine the initial capacity of the Ferris wheel in terms of the number of people it can accommodate, one must first understand the operational principle. The Ferris wheel consists of 50 seats arranged in a circular pattern, each designed to carry a single rider. To find out the total capacity, we simply multiply the number of seats by the capacity per seat, which is one person per seat.So, using the formula:Capacity = Number of seats × Capacity per seatCapacity = 50 seats × 1 person/seatCalculating this, we get:Capacity = 50 peopleHowever, an unfortunate incident occurred when 10 seats became non-functional. This affects both the Ferris wheel and its riders. The broken seats reduce the available space, impacting the Ferris wheel's operational efficiency. During regular operation or a special event where the full capacity was expected, the reduced capacity becomes relevant for safety regulations and operational capacity planning.To address this issue, it's crucial to know how many people can still safely ride. With 10 seats out of service, the revised capacity would be:New capacity = Initial capacity - Broken seatsNew capacity = 50 people - 10 peoplePerforming the subtraction:New capacity = 40 peopleTherefore, knowing the new capacity is essential for ensuring the well-being of the riders and maintaining compliance with safety standards at Paradise Park.

Question:Each basket of peaches has 19 red peaches and 4 green peaches. If there are 15 such baskets How many peaches are in the baskets altogether?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:basket of peaches, 19 red peaches, 4 green peaches, 15 baskets, peaches..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should I perform to find out the total number of peaches in each basket?2. What is the calculation needed to determine the number of red peaches in all the baskets?3. How many green peaches are there in 15 baskets combined?4. Which mathematical operation would I use to find the total number of peaches from the red and green peaches in each basket?5. Who is this problem about, specifically the person performing the calculation or the peaches themselves?6. Where does this scenario take place, in a market, a farm, or another context?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this fruit-related problem, we are given information about peaches distributed among baskets. To find the total number of peaches in each basket, you would need to add up the number of red and green peaches separately for each basket, using the addition operation. For instance, if there are 8 red peaches and 6 green peaches in one basket, the total would be 8 + 6 = 14 peaches.To determine the number of red peaches in all the baskets, you would multiply the number of red peaches per basket by the total number of baskets. If there are 8 red peaches in each basket and there are 10 baskets, the calculation would be 8 * 10 = 80 red peaches.If there are 15 baskets, and each basket contains 6 green peaches, the total number of green peaches can be found by multiplying the quantity of green peaches per basket by the number of baskets: 6 * 15 = 90 green peaches.To find the total number of peaches from the red and green peaches in each basket, you would again use addition. If a basket has 8 red and 6 green peaches, the combined total would be 8 + 6 = 14 peaches per basket.The problem is about a person, likely a fruit vendor or someone keeping track of inventory, who is performing these calculations to manage the supply of peaches.

Question:In a school there are 135 girls and 214 boys. 496 more girls and 910 more boys joined the school. How many boys are there in the school now?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:school, girls, 135, boys, 214, joined, girls, 496, boys, 910, school now.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find out how many girls initially were in the school?2. What mathematical operation should be used to calculate the total number of girls after 496 new ones joined?3. Who are the individuals whose count increased (girls or boys) and by how many?4. Where does this situation take place - in the original school or the updated school?5. When did the new students join the school - before or after the given numbers were provided?6. Why is it important to know the current number of boys in the school? (For example, to determine gender ratio or adjust facilities)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In an educational institution, the initial count of students was divided into boys and girls. To determine the number of girls initially present, we would need to subtract the number of boys from the total count. However, the exact numbers for boys and girls were not provided, so we cannot compute that directly.When 496 new girls joined the school, a mathematical operation involving addition would be employed to find the total number of girls after their enrollment. The formula would be:Total number of girls after joining = Initial number of girls + 496Unfortunately, without knowing the initial number of girls, we can't calculate the exact figure. The increase in the girls' count indicates that the girls' population expanded, while there's no mention of any change in the boys' count.This situation takes place in the original school, before the additional 496 girls joined. The new students joined after the initial data was given, altering the gender composition.Knowing the current number of boys in the school is essential for several reasons. First, it helps maintain a balanced gender ratio, which could influence decision-making processes like class allocation, resource distribution, or planning for gender-specific activities. Second, it allows administrators to assess the overall student body and ensure that facilities, such as sports facilities or separate study areas, are appropriately adjusted according to the gender distribution.

Question:Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 12 peaches How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jake, peaches, Steven, 16 fewer, Jill, 15 more, 12 peaches, more peaches than Jake.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Jake's situation involve (subtracting 16)?2. What is the relationship between Jill and Steven's peaches (Steven has 15 more)?3. How many peaches does Steven have (Jill's + 15)?4. How many peaches does Jake have (Steven's - 16)?5. In what comparison are we interested (Jill's peaches more than Jake's)?6. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake (Jill's - Jake's)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Jake's situation, he is involved in subtracting 16 from a quantity, which likely represents the number of peaches he has. Jill, on the other hand, has a certain number of peaches, and Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. To find out how many peaches Steven has, we can add 15 to Jill's count. Let's say Jill has x peaches, then Steven would have x + 15 peaches.Now, to determine how many peaches Jake has, we subtract 16 from Steven's total, so Jake has (x + 15) - 16 peaches. Simplifying this, we get x - 1 for Jake's peaches.The comparison we are interested in is whether Jill's peaches are more than Jake's. Since Jill has x peaches and Jake has x - 1, we can see that Jill indeed has one more peach than Jake.To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract Jake's count from Jill's: x - (x - 1) = 1.In summary, Jake's situation involves subtracting 16, and the comparison we're interested in is Jill having one more peach than Jake, with Jill having x + 15 peaches (where x is Jill's count) and Jake having x - 1 peaches. The difference between their counts is 1 peach.

Therefore, the answer is 1

Question:In a school there are 635 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 510 more boys than girls How many boys are there in that school?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Question:Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 235 of the pickers that they fill 100 drums of raspberries per day and 221 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:favorite, checking on the grapevines, last stop, 235 pickers, 100 drums of raspberries per day, 221 drums of grapes per day, 77 days, drums of grapes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many drums of grapes are filled per day?2. What is the total number of drums of grapes produced by 235 pickers combined daily?3. Who provided the information about the number of drums of grapes and raspberries per day?4. In what context does the person check on the grapevines as their last stop?5. Over how many days does the person want to know the grape production?6. Why is it important to calculate the number of drums of grapes for 77 days?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the daily grape drum filling rate, one would need to perform a division operation, using the given information about the number of pickers and their combined daily production. If we assume that each picker fills a certain number of drums per day, let's denote this rate as x (drums per picker per day). With 235 pickers working together, the total number of drums produced can be calculated as 235 pickers * x drums/picker/day.For the second question, if the passage provides the exact rate per picker, multiply that by 235 to get the total number of drums for all pickers combined. However, without that specific rate, we cannot provide an exact number.The information about the number of drums per day comes from the person who checks on the grapevines, likely a supervisor or someone involved in the grape harvesting process. They visit the vineyard as their final stop to gather these figures.To answer the fourth question, the person checks on the grapevines as their last stop because it is likely when they have completed all other tasks and can accurately assess the current grape production before the day's end.For the fifth question, if the person wants to know grape production over a period of 77 days, we would multiply the daily production rate by 77 to get the total drums for that duration.Calculating the number of drums of grapes for 77 days is important because it allows the person to monitor the overall grape harvest for a significant period, which could be crucial for inventory management, planning future shipments, or determining seasonal trends in production.

How can we determine the initial quantity of crayons Paul had in the box, using the information provided about the ones he gave away, lost, and had left?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul started with a box of crayons that he received as a birthday gift. He began using and distributing them at an unspecified time. One day, he decided to share his joy by giving away 52 crayons to his friends. This generous act was likely in response to their creative endeavors or simply to spread happiness.Unfortunately, Paul also experienced a setback when he accidentally lost 535 crayons, which significantly reduced the count. To find out how many crayons he initially had, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away and lost from the total amount he initially received.Let's denote the initial number of crayons as \( I \). After giving away 52 crayons, he had \( I - 52 \) left. Adding the 535 crayons he later lost, the equation becomes:\[ I - 52 + 535 = I \]Solving for \( I \), we get:\[ I + 483 = I \]\[ 483 = 52 \]So, initially, Paul had \( 483 + 52 \) crayons before any were given away or lost:\[ I = 535 \]In conclusion, Paul initially had 535 crayons in the box. The beneficiaries of the 52 crayons given away were his friends, and he shared them as a gesture of friendship. Calculating the total loss (535 - 52) helps Paul understand the extent of the reduction in his crayon collection, which might be important for replacing them, keeping track of personal items, or simply reflecting on the impact of his actions.

Therefore, the answer is 587

Question:Danny collects bottle caps. He threw away 60 of the old ones at the park while he found 58 bottle caps new ones. Now he has 67 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information given in the question.
- Danny starts with a certain number of bottle caps.
- He throws away 60 old ones at the park.
- He finds 58 new ones.
- His final count is 67 bottle caps.

Step 2: Determine the goal.
We want to find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, before throwing away any and finding new ones.

Step 3: Set up the equation.
To find the initial number of bottle caps, we need to add the number of caps he threw away to the number he found, then subtract that sum from his current total.

Initial caps = Current total + Caps thrown away - Caps found

Step 4: Plug in the numbers.
Initial caps = 67 (current total) + 60 (thrown away) - 58 (found)

Step 5: Calculate.
Initial caps = 67 + 60 - 58
Initial caps = 127 - 58
Initial caps = 69

So, Danny had 69 bottle caps at first.

Question:Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rachel, picked, 6 ripe apples, her tree, 2 ripe apples, 4 unripe apples, the tree, begin with..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should we perform to find out how many apples the tree had initially before Rachel picked any?2. What calculation would help us determine the total number of apples on the tree before Rachel's harvest?3. Who or what was the subject having the initial number of apples on the tree?4. Where does the information about the 6 ripe apples picked by Rachel fit into the overall problem?5. When did the situation take place where Rachel picked the apples and the tree's count was recorded?6. Why is it important to know the initial number of apples on the tree if we already have the current counts?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a scenario involving an apple tree, the initial number of apples can be determined through a simple mathematical operation. To find out how many apples the tree had before Rachel's harvest, we would need to subtract the number of apples she picked from the current count. Let's denote the initial count as I and the number of ripe apples Rachel picked as R, which in this case is 6.For calculation step 1, we would use the formula:Initial Apples (I) = Current Apples - Apples Picked (R)So, if we know the current count after Rachel's picking, we would subtract 6 from that number.To determine the total number of apples on the tree before Rachel's harvest (step 2), we would add the 6 apples she picked back to the initial count:Total Apples Before Harvest = Initial Apples + Apples PickedThe subject having the initial number of apples was the tree (step 3), and the information about the 6 ripe apples picked by Rachel (step 4) serves as a crucial piece of data that affects the initial count.This situation took place at a specific point in time when Rachel's picking occurred (step 5), and knowing the initial count is important because it allows us to understand the tree's state before any external intervention, such as Rachel's harvest, altered the numbers (step 6). By calculating the initial quantity, we can analyze the tree's growth, potential yield, or any changes that might have occurred naturally.

Question:He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 66 sacks per day and that each sack containes 25 oranges. How many oranges will they have after 87 days of harvest?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:harvested oranges, 66 sacks per day, 25 oranges per sack, 87 days of harvest..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many oranges are harvested in one day?2. What is the total number of oranges harvested if they collect 66 sacks per day?3. Who is responsible for harvesting the oranges, and what is their role in the process?4. Where does the harvesting of oranges take place, and what is the significance of this location?5. When does the harvest typically occur, and why is 87 days chosen as the duration for this particular calculation?6. How can we calculate the total number of oranges harvested over 87 days using the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The harvesting of oranges follows a systematic process in which the daily yield is an essential factor. To determine the number of oranges harvested in one day, you would perform a simple division operation. For instance, if they collect 66 sacks of oranges per day, and each sack contains an average of 500 oranges, you would multiply 66 by 500 to find out the total for a single day:\[ \text{Oranges per day} = \text{Sacks per day} \times \text{Oranges per sack} \]\[ \text{Oranges per day} = 66 \times 500 \]This would result in 33,000 oranges harvested daily.The responsibility for harvesting falls on a dedicated team of workers, who carefully pick the ripe oranges from the trees. This task is vital as it ensures the freshness and quality of the produce. The oranges are typically harvested from well-maintained orchards that provide optimal growing conditions.The harvest usually occurs during the late summer and early fall, when the fruit reaches its peak ripeness. In this particular case, the duration of the harvest is chosen to be 87 days. This could be because it corresponds to a full growing season, allowing for ample time to gather a substantial harvest before the weather conditions change or the oranges become overripe.To calculate the total number of oranges harvested over the 87-day period, you would simply multiply the daily yield by the number of days:\[ \text{Total Oranges Harvested} = \text{Oranges per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]\[ \text{Total Oranges Harvested} = 33,000 \times 87 \]Carrying out this calculation, we find that the total harvest for 87 days would be approximately 2,871,000 oranges. This impressive quantity highlights the magnitude of the annual orange harvest at this location.

Question:He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 76 sacks per day and discard 64 of them. How many oranges do they harvest per day if each sack contains 50 oranges?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information given in the question.
- Sacks harvested per day: 76
- Sacks discarded per day: 64
- Oranges per sack: 50

Step 2: Calculate the effective number of sacks harvested per day.
To find out how many sacks of oranges are actually used, we subtract the discarded sacks from the harvested ones:
Effective sacks = Sacks harvested - Sacks discarded
Effective sacks = 76 - 64

Step 3: Calculate the total number of oranges harvested per day.
Now that we have the effective number of sacks, we multiply that by the number of oranges per sack to find the total oranges:
Total oranges = Effective sacks * Oranges per sack

Let's do the calculations:

Effective sacks = 76 - 64 = 12 sacks
Total oranges = 12 sacks * 50 oranges/sack

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

Total oranges = 12 * 50 = 600 oranges

So, they harvest 600 oranges per day.

Question:Lewis earns $ 368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 388 rent every week How much money does he pay as rent during the harvest season?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Lewis, $368 every week, 1359 weeks of harvest, $388 rent every week, money paid as rent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how much Lewis pays in rent weekly?2. What is the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season?3. Who is responsible for paying the rent every week?4. Where does this financial transaction take place - with respect to the harvest or in a separate context?5. When does the calculation of rent payments occur - weekly, monthly, or over the entire harvest season?6. How much money does Lewis pay in rent over the course of the 1359 weeks of harvest?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Lewis follows a financial arrangement for his living expenses during the harvest season. To determine his weekly rent payment, he uses a simple division operation, as the annual rent of $5,278.80 is split evenly across the 52 weeks of the harvest season. The calculation for weekly rent can be done by dividing the annual rent by 52: $5,278.80 / 52 = $101.14 per week.During the harvest season, which lasts for 1359 weeks, Lewis earns an average income of $120 per day. To find out his total earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in the harvest season, assuming there are no days off: $120/day * 1359 days = $1,630,800.The responsibility for paying rent falls on Lewis himself, as he is the one who incurs this expense. This financial transaction takes place weekly, aligning with his earnings and the division of the annual rent into weekly installments.In summary, Lewis pays $101.14 in rent each week, with the calculation occurring weekly. Over the course of the 1359 weeks of the harvest season, he spends $101.14/week * 1359 weeks = $1,376,274 on rent. His total earnings during this period amount to $1,630,800.

Question:Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.
- Lewis earns $491 per week.
- There are 1181 weeks of harvest.
- He pays $216 in rent every week.

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings during the harvest season.
To find out how much money Lewis earns in total, we multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks:
Total earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $491 * 1181

Step 3: Calculate the total rent payments during the harvest season.
To find out how much he spends on rent, we multiply his weekly rent by the number of weeks:
Total rent = Weekly rent * Number of weeks
Total rent = $216 * 1181

Step 4: Subtract the total rent from the total earnings to find out how much money he has left at the end of the harvest season.
Money left = Total earnings - Total rent

Now let's do the calculations:

Total earnings = $491 * 1181 = $577,971
Total rent = $216 * 1181 = $254,256

Money left = $577,971 - $254,256

Now, subtracting the rent from the earnings:
Money left = $323,715

So, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $323,715.

Question:Danny collects bottle caps. He threw away 6 of the old ones at the park while he found 50 bottle caps new ones. Now he has 60 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Danny, collects, bottle caps, threw away, 6 old ones, park, found, 50 new ones, now has, 60 bottle caps, more, park than threw away..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Danny perform to find out the total number of bottle caps he had before throwing some away?2. What operation should be used to determine how many bottle caps Danny initially had in his collection?3. Who is the subject performing the action of throwing away bottle caps at the park?4. Where did Danny throw away the 6 old bottle caps?5. When did the action of finding 50 new bottle caps occur in relation to throwing away the old ones?6. How many more bottle caps did Danny find compared to the ones he threw away, which is the main focus of the question?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a series of events, Danny was curious about the total number of bottle caps he had in his collection. To find out this, he first subtracted the number of bottle caps he threw away from the count he had after discovering some new ones. At the park, he had thrown away 6 old bottle caps. Simultaneously, he stumbled upon 50 shiny new bottle caps. By performing the subtraction operation, we can calculate the initial quantity: Total before throwing = Total after finding - Thrown awayLet's denote the initial number of bottle caps as \( X \). After finding new ones, he had \( X + 50 \) caps. So,\( X + 50 - 6 = X \)Solving for \( X \), we get:\( X + 44 = X \)\( 50 - 6 = X \)\( 44 = X \)So, Danny initially had 44 bottle caps. The main focus of the question is the difference between the number of new caps and the old ones he got rid of, which is:New caps found - Caps thrown away\( 50 - 6 = 44 \)Therefore, Danny found 44 more bottle caps than the ones he threw away.

Question:Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 85 raisin cookies and 403 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Helen, hippo, friends, Thanksgiving, Helen's house, raisin cookies, 144 chocolate chip cookies, 397 raisin cookies, 85 raisin cookies, 403 chocolate chip cookies..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which type of cookies did Helen bake more of, chocolate chip or raisin, before this morning?2. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake in total yesterday?3. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake this morning?4. In what event or celebration were the cookies prepared - Thanksgiving or some other occasion?5. Where was the baking activity taking place - at Helen's house or elsewhere?6. Why was Helen baking so many cookies - for a gathering, personal consumption, or gift-giving?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Helen, an avid baker, had been preparing cookies for an upcoming event. Before this morning, she had baked a total of 100 cookies, with an equal number of chocolate chip and raisin varieties. Yesterday, she focused on raisin cookies, baking half of her total cookie count. To find out how many raisin cookies she made yesterday, we can divide the total number of cookies by 2:\( \frac{100 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 50 \text{ raisin cookies} \)This morning, she baked another batch, which was also a third of her total cookie count at that point. Since she had already baked 50 raisin cookies, this would be:\( \frac{100 \text{ cookies} - 50 \text{ (yesterday's raisin cookies)}}{3} \)\( \frac{50 \text{ cookies}}{3} \approx 16.67 \)Rounded to the nearest whole number, she baked approximately 17 raisin cookies this morning.The cookies were being prepared for Thanksgiving, a time when families gather to share delicious treats. The baking activity took place at Helen's cozy house, where she has all the necessary ingredients and equipment. Helen was baking so many cookies not just for personal consumption but also as gifts for friends and neighbors, to spread the holiday cheer.

Question:A school has 485 pupils. There are 232 girls and the rest are boys. How many boys are there in that school?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:school, 485 pupils, girls, rest, boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find out how many boys are in the school?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the number of boys if there are 232 girls?3. Who are the pupils referred to in the problem?4. Where does this situation take place - in a school?5. When is this information relevant - is it for current enrollment or historical data?6. Why is it important to know the number of boys if there are 232 girls? (to find the gender ratio or to allocate resources, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario, the task at hand is to determine the number of boys in a school based on the given information about the girls. To find out how many boys are present, one would need to perform an operation that involves subtracting the known number of girls from the total student population. If there are 232 girls in the school, let's denote the total number of students as \( T \). Assuming that the ratio of boys to girls is approximately equal, we can calculate the number of boys (\( B \)) using the following formula:\[ B = T - G \]\[ B = T - 232 \]Without knowing the exact total student count, we cannot provide an exact number for the boys. However, once \( T \) is known, the calculation would yield the answer. The pupils in question are the students enrolled in the school, and this situation pertains to the current enrollment, as it deals with the current distribution of boys and girls. Knowing the number of boys is crucial for various reasons, such as calculating the gender ratio, which is essential for educational planning, allocating resources fairly between genders, or ensuring balanced extracurricular activities. In short, understanding the boy-to-girl ratio is vital for creating inclusive and equitable policies within the school environment.

Question:Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.
- Sofia asked students to suggest food types
- Total choices: 66
- Suggested mashed potatoes: 450 students
- Suggested bacon: 38 students
- Rest did not participate

Step 2: Determine what needs to be calculated.
- We need to find out the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items, which means the sum of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon.

Step 3: Calculate the number of participating students.
- Add the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon: 450 (mashed potatoes) + 38 (bacon).

Step 4: Perform the calculation.
\( 450 + 38 = 488 \)

Step 5: Since the rest did not participate, we can assume that the total number of students who participated is the ones who suggested mashed potatoes or bacon, minus the number of students who suggested both (since they were counted twice). However, the question does not specify whether there were any students who suggested both mashed potatoes and bacon, so we'll assume that the 488 students includes those who suggested both.

Conclusion: 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.

This was the result of the addition operation.Next, to find the combined number of old games between Katie and her friends, she needed to add their collections together. So, she added Katie's games with her cousin's: 22 (Katie) + 9 (cousin's) = 31 old games. This sum represents the total shared by all of them.Her friend's total remained unchanged at 7 games. Therefore, to find the sum of old games that both Katie and her friends possess combined, she added Katie's total with her friend's total: 22 (Katie) + 7 (friend's total) = 29 old games.Lastly, to get the overall total of old games when combining Katie's and her friends', she summed all the individual counts: 22 (Katie's) + 7 (friend's) + 9 (cousin's) = 38 old games. This final number represents the grand total of all the old games they collectively have.

Therefore, the answer is 121

Question:Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework, 2 pages of reading homework and 96 more pages of biology homework. How many more pages of math homework than reading homework did she have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rachel, math homework, 9 pages, reading homework, 2 pages, biology homework, more pages, difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Rachel need to perform to find out how many pages of math homework she has compared to reading homework?2. What calculation does Rachel need to make to determine the difference between the number of pages for math and reading homework?3. Who is the subject involved in completing the different types of homework (math, reading, and biology)?4. In what subject is the extra 96 pages of homework assigned, and how does it relate to the math and reading homework?5. Given the timeframe for completing homework, is there a specific due date or context that affects the comparison of math and reading homework?6. Why is the difference between math and reading homework important to know for Rachel? (e.g., to manage her time, track progress, or understand workload distribution)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rachel needs to perform subtraction to find out how many pages of math homework she has compared to reading homework. To determine the difference, she would subtract the number of pages for reading homework from the number of pages for math homework. The subject involved in both math and reading homework is Rachel herself, as she is the one completing these assignments. The extra 96 pages are assigned in biology, which is separate from the math and reading homework. This information is relevant because it helps Rachel understand her overall workload distribution.To calculate the difference between math and reading homework, Rachel uses the formula: Math pages - Reading pages. Since there is no specific due date mentioned, the comparison is likely made to manage her time effectively, track her progress, and ensure a balanced allocation of study hours between subjects. Knowing this difference is crucial for Rachel to plan her study sessions efficiently and avoid procrastination.

Therefore, the answer is 7

Question:Baker made 99 cakes. He bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 cakes. How many more cakes did baker buy than those he sold?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Baker, cakes, 99 cakes, bought, 167 new cakes, sold, 89 cakes, more cakes bought, than, sold..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Baker perform with the 99 cakes he initially made?2. What is the total number of cakes Baker had after buying new ones?3. Who are the two parties involved in the comparison of cake quantities?4. Where does the comparison between the number of cakes bought and sold take place?5. When does the action of buying and selling cakes occur in relation to Baker's overall process?6. Why is it important to find out how many more cakes Baker bought than he sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Baker, an enthusiastic baker, began his day by making a substantial batch of 99 delicious cakes. As the day progressed, he decided to expand his offerings by purchasing additional cakes from a neighboring bakery. To calculate the total number of cakes Baker had after the purchase, we simply add the initial quantity to the newly bought ones. If Baker bought 50 more cakes, we can perform the calculation: 99 (initial cakes) + 50 (bought cakes) = 149 cakes.The comparison between the number of cakes Baker bought and those he sold took place at the end of his busy day when he was tallying up his inventory. This evaluation is crucial because it helps Baker understand his profit or loss from the baking business, as well as his overall success in managing the quantity of cakes throughout the day.In terms of the timeline, the buying and selling of cakes occurred after the initial production, during the course of his operations. The comparison serves as a benchmark for determining whether Baker's sales were sufficient to cover his expenses and meet customer demand.To find out how many more cakes Baker bought than he sold, we would need the exact number of cakes he sold. Without that figure, we cannot directly determine the difference. However, if we know the number of cakes sold, subtracting it from the total number of cakes (149) would provide us with the surplus, which represents the cakes Baker bought but didn't sell.

Therefore, the answer is 78

Question:Haley grew 9 trees in her backyard. After a typhoon 4 died. Then she grew 5 more trees. How many trees does she have left?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Haley, trees, backyard, 9 trees, typhoon, 4 died, 5 more trees, left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did Haley perform first: growing 9 trees or losing 4 trees due to the typhoon?2. What is the result of subtracting the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees Haley grew?3. Who experienced the loss of trees after the typhoon? 4. In what location did Haley grow the trees?5. When did the typhoon occur in relation to Haley's tree-growing activity?6. How many trees did Haley have after she grew an additional 5 trees following the typhoon?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Haley began her tree-growing project by planting 9 trees. Unfortunately, a typhoon struck and resulted in the loss of 4 trees. To find out which operation she performed first, we consider the sequence of events. Since the growing occurred before the typhoon, Haley grew the trees first. After subtracting the trees that died due to the typhoon from the initial growth, the result would be:Initial growth: 9 treesLoss from typhoon: -4 treesResulting trees: 9 - 4 = 5 treesThe loss of trees after the typhoon affected Haley's count. The location where she grew the trees is not specified in the given information. However, the passage states that the typhoon occurred after the initial growth, so it was during or after the time she started growing trees.After the typhoon, Haley decided to add more trees to her collection. She grew an additional 5 trees, so to find out how many trees she had in total after this addition, we simply add the surviving trees to the new growth:Surviving trees: 5 (from the typhoon)Additional growth: +5 treesTotal trees after typhoon and growth: 5 + 5 = 10 treesIn summary, Haley grew 9 trees first, and then lost 4 to the typhoon, leaving her with 5 trees. After the typhoon, she added 5 more trees, resulting in a total of 10 trees. The exact location of the tree-growing and the timing relative to the typhoon are not provided in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is 10

Question:Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rachel, picked, 7 apples, tree, 2 new apples, grew, tree, now, 6 apples, begin with..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did Rachel perform on the apples she picked?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out how many apples were on the tree initially before Rachel picked any?3. Who or what was responsible for the increase in the number of apples on the tree?4. Where did Rachel pick the apples from?5. When did the 2 new apples grow on the tree?6. Why is it important to determine the initial number of apples on the tree?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rachel performed the operation of subtraction on the apples she picked from the tree. To find out how many apples were on the tree initially, you would use the formula for finding the difference between the initial count and the remaining count after Rachel's picking. If Rachel picked 5 apples and there are now 7 apples left, the calculation would be:Initial Apples = Picked Apples + Remaining ApplesInitial Apples = 5 (picked by Rachel) + 7 (remaining)Initial Apples = 12So, there were 12 apples on the tree before Rachel picked any.The increase in the number of apples on the tree, from 5 to 7, can be attributed to the natural growth process, as the tree produced new fruit over time.Rachel picked the apples from a tree, specifically one that was likely in her garden or a nearby orchard.The 2 new apples grew on the tree after Rachel had already picked some, so we don't have an exact time frame for when they appeared. However, it's reasonable to assume they grew during the period between Rachel's picking and the moment we observe them.Determining the initial number of apples on the tree is important for understanding the total harvest potential, calculating how much the tree has produced, and possibly tracking the tree's growth rate or yield over time. It also helps in planning future picking or maintenance activities.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Gwen's birthday, 2 dollars (from mom), 4 more dollars (from dad), spent 3 dollars, money still had..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) does Gwen perform to calculate the total amount of money she received on her birthday?2. What is the total amount of money Gwen received from both her mom and dad combined?3. Who provided the initial 2 dollars for Gwen's birthday gift?4. In what context did Gwen receive the additional 4 dollars from her dad?5. When did Gwen spend the 3 dollars mentioned in the problem?6. How much money does Gwen have left after spending the 3 dollars, considering the initial gifts she received?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:On Gwen's special day, she excitedly calculated the total amount of money she received as birthday gifts. First, she started with an initial gift of 2 dollars from her mom. Then, her dad added another 4 dollars to the pile, which he gave with a warm smile. To find the combined total from both her mom and dad, Gwen simply added the two amounts together using the basic addition operation: 2 dollars (from mom) + 4 dollars (from dad) = 6 dollars.The initial 2 dollars for Gwen's birthday gift came from her mom. Her dad provided the additional 4 dollars, likely during a heartfelt conversation or a surprise moment during the celebration.Gwen received the extra 4 dollars from her dad in the context of her birthday presents, as it was part of the overall gift-giving tradition. As for the 3 dollars, Gwen spent it later that day when she went to the candy store to buy her favorite gummy bears, using the simple subtraction operation to determine how much she had left: 6 dollars (total received) - 3 dollars (spent) = 3 dollars.After her treat, Gwen realized she still had 3 dollars remaining from her birthday funds, which she could save or use for future fun activities.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Allan, 2 balloons, Jake, 6 balloons, bought 3 more balloons, park, more balloons, had than Allan..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem require to compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's?2. What is the total number of balloons Allan had after buying more at the park?3. Who had more balloons initially before Allan bought any more?4. In what location did Allan buy the additional balloons?5. When did Allan buy the 3 more balloons at the park?6. Why is it necessary to find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's, we needed to perform an arithmetic operation, specifically subtraction. Initially, Allan had 10 balloons, while Jake had 15. The problem required subtracting Allan's initial count from Jake's to determine the difference: 15 (Jake's balloons) - 10 (Allan's initial balloons) = 5 balloons.After buying more at the park, Allan increased his total by 3 balloons. To find the new total, we added the additional balloons to his initial count: 10 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 13 balloons.Comparing their counts again, it's clear that Jake had more balloons initially, as he had 15 balloons compared to Allan's 10.Allan bought the extra 3 balloons at the park, but the exact time is not specified in the information provided. However, we can infer that it happened after the comparison with Jake.The reason for finding out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan is to establish a numerical advantage, which could be relevant to a competition, a game, or simply to understand the relative quantity each person had at that point in time. This comparison helps in determining who might have had the larger supply of balloons.

Question:Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 12 peaches How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jake, peaches, Steven, 16 fewer, Jill, 15 more, 12 peaches, more peaches than Jake.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Jake's situation involve (subtracting 16)?2. What is the relationship between Jill and Steven's peaches (Steven has 15 more)?3. How many peaches does Steven have (Jill's + 15)?4. How many peaches does Jake have (Steven's - 16)?5. In what comparison are we interested (Jill's peaches more than Jake's)?6. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake (Jill's - Jake's)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Jake's situation, he is involved in subtracting 16 from a quantity, which likely represents the number of peaches he has. Jill, on the other hand, has a certain number of peaches, and Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. To find out how many peaches Steven has, we can add 15 to Jill's count. Let's say Jill has x peaches, then Steven would have x + 15 peaches.Now, to determine how many peaches Jake has, we subtract 16 from Steven's total, so Jake has (x + 15) - 16 peaches. Simplifying this, we get x - 1 for Jake's peaches.The comparison we are interested in is whether Jill's peaches are more than Jake's. Since Jill has x peaches and Jake has x - 1, we can see that Jill indeed has one more peach than Jake.To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract Jake's count from Jill's: x - (x - 1) = 1.In summary, Jake's situation involves subtracting 16, and the comparison we're interested in is Jill having one more peach than Jake, with Jill having x + 15 peaches (where x is Jill's count) and Jake having x - 1 peaches. The difference between their counts is 1 peach.

Therefore, the answer is 1

Question:Baker made 170 cakes. He sold 78 of them and bought 31 new cakes. How many more cakes did baker sell than those he bought?

To find out how many cards she distributed, we can subtract the remaining cards from the initial count: 438 - 178 = 260 cards were given away.Out of these, it's mentioned that all the Ace cards were given to Jeff. If we denote the total number of Ace cards as A, then the number given to Jeff would also be A. Unfortunately, the exact number of Aces Nell initially had isn't provided, but we know she gave away all of them.After giving away her Ace cards, Nell now has 178 baseball cards and none left, while Jeff has A Ace cards. To determine the difference in their Ace card collections, we need to know the initial number of Aces Nell had. Let's assume that number as X. Then, Jeff has X cards and Nell has 0, so the difference is X - 0 = X.In terms of their overall baseball card collections, Nell currently has fewer baseball cards than Ace cards (178 < X). This comparison highlights that Nell might have been more inclined towards collecting Ace cards than baseball cards in general.Nell's interest in knowing the difference between her baseball cards and Ace cards could stem from evaluating her collection's diversity, understanding her personal preferences, or preparing for a competition where having a balanced collection might be advantageous. By calculating the disparity, she can make informed decisions about acquiring new cards or focusing on particular types.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Paul, box of crayons, birthday, lost or given away, 551 crayons, 177 crayons left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should Paul perform to find out how many crayons he initially had before losing or giving away any?2. What mathematical operation can be used to calculate the initial number of crayons Paul had if we know the number he lost or gave away and the ones he had left?3. Who are the parties involved in the situation where Paul lost or gave away crayons - Paul himself or someone else?4. Where did this situation occur - at home, school, or somewhere else?5. When did Paul receive the box of crayons, and when did he lose or give them away?6. Why is it important to determine the initial number of crayons? Could it be related to a ratio or understanding the distribution?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul found himself in a situation where he wanted to recall the number of crayons he initially had before any losses or gifts occurred. To solve this, he needed to perform an addition operation. If he knew the exact number of crayons he had lost or given away, say it was 15, and the remaining count was 30, he could use the formula for subtraction to find the initial quantity:Initial Number = Remaining Crayons + Lost or Given Away CrayonsIn this case, the calculation would be:Initial Number = 30 (crayons left) + 15 (lost or given away)Adding these together gives us:Initial Number = 45 crayonsThe parties involved in this situation were Paul himself, as he was both the one who received the box of crayons and experienced the loss or giveaway. This incident took place at home, likely during a time when he was engaged in creative activities with his children or simply organizing his belongings.Determining the initial number of crayons was crucial for Paul because it allowed him to understand the distribution or ratio of crayons before and after the loss or donation. This could be significant if he needed to replenish his supply based on a specific ratio or if he wanted to account for the change in his art supplies. By knowing the starting point, Paul could make informed decisions about purchasing new crayons or redistributing what he still had.

Question:Carol was sending out birthday invitations to 12 friends. She bought 3 packs each one having the same number of invitations. How many invitations are in each pack?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the total number of invitations Carol needs.
Carol is sending out birthday invitations to 12 friends.

Step 2: Determine the number of packs she bought.
She bought 3 packs of invitations.

Step 3: Calculate the number of invitations per pack.
To find out how many invitations are in each pack, we need to divide the total number of invitations by the number of packs.

Total invitations = Number of friends * Invitations per friend
Since there's no mention of how many invitations are in each individual invitation, we'll assume that each friend gets one invitation.

So,
Invitations per pack = Total invitations / Number of packs
Invitations per pack = 12 friends / 3 packs

Step 4: Perform the division.
Invitations per pack = 4

Therefore, there are 4 invitations in each pack.

When does the comparison happen - during the ride or after all children have boarded?6. Why is it important to know the difference in the number of children? (Objective or purpose)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a bus starts its journey with an unknown number of children and stops at a point to pick up more, understanding the operations involved helps to determine the total count. To find out how many children were initially on the bus before the bus stop, we would need to perform an initial subtraction. Let's denote the number of children on the bus before the stop as \( B_0 \) and the number that got off during the ride as \( C_{off} \).The calculation for the initial number of children is:\[ B_0 = Total \; Children \; After \; Offloading \; - \; C_{off} \]Next, to determine the number of children who got on the bus at the stop, we would add the new passengers, represented by \( C_{on} \), to the current count:\[ C_{on} = Total \; Children \; After \; Pick-up \; - \; B_0 \]In this situation, the number of children added or subtracted is the key measurement. The comparison takes place both before and after the bus stop, but the focus is primarily after the events occur. The comparison happens during the ride when the offloading and picking up of children are noted.Knowing the difference in the number of children, which is \( C_{on} - C_{off} \), is important for several objectives. It could be crucial for tracking the bus's occupancy, ensuring seat reservations, calculating fare revenue, or maintaining records for safety and logistical purposes. By knowing the net change, one can accurately gauge the bus's capacity utilization and plan accordingly.

Question:Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons. If he only had 492 crayons left How many crayons had been lost or given away?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Paul, box of crayons, birthday, gave to friends, 52 crayons, lost crayons, 535 crayons, left, 492 crayons..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) should be used to find out how many crayons Paul initially had before giving any to his friends or losing any?2. What is the total number of crayons that Paul either gave away or lost, considering both the 52 crayons to friends and the 535 crayons lost?3. Who are the beneficiaries of the 52 crayons that Paul gave away, and what was the reason for giving them the crayons?4. In what context did Paul receive the box of crayons as a birthday gift, and when did he start using or distributing them?5. Why does Paul need to calculate the total loss of crayons, and what might be the purpose of knowing this number?6. How can we determine the initial quantity of crayons Paul had in the box, using the information provided about the ones he gave away, lost, and had left?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul started with a box of crayons that he received as a birthday gift. He began using and distributing them at an unspecified time. One day, he decided to share his joy by giving away 52 crayons to his friends. This generous act was likely in response to their creative endeavors or simply to spread happiness.Unfortunately, Paul also experienced a setback when he accidentally lost 535 crayons, which significantly reduced the count. To find out how many crayons he initially had, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away and lost from the total amount he initially received.Let's denote the initial number of crayons as \( I \). After giving away 52 crayons, he had \( I - 52 \) left. Adding the 535 crayons he later lost, the equation becomes:\[ I - 52 + 535 = I \]Solving for \( I \), we get:\[ I + 483 = I \]\[ 483 = 52 \]So, initially, Paul had \( 483 + 52 \) crayons before any were given away or lost:\[ I = 535 \]In conclusion, Paul initially had 535 crayons in the box. The beneficiaries of the 52 crayons given away were his friends, and he shared them as a gesture of friendship. Calculating the total loss (535 - 52) helps Paul understand the extent of the reduction in his crayon collection, which might be important for replacing them, keeping track of personal items, or simply reflecting on the impact of his actions.

Question:Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Zachary, push-ups, 15, David, 39 more, John, 9 push-ups less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to compare the number of push-ups Zachary did with David's?2. What calculation does David perform on Zachary's number of push-ups to find his own count?3. Who did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, and how many push-ups did David do in total?4. In what context did John perform push-ups, and how many push-ups did he do compared to Zachary?5. When did this situation occur - was it a one-time event or part of a routine?6. Why is it important to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John? (Objective or purpose)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a friendly competition to maintain fitness, Zachary and David engaged in a push-up challenge. To compare their progress, they used the comparison operator "more than" or "greater than" (>). Zachary had completed 75 push-ups, while David wanted to know his own count relative to Zachary's. To find out how many push-ups he needed to do, David subtracted Zachary's count from his target, which would be represented by the formula: David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + additional push-ups.David calculated that he needed to do 100 push-ups in total, so he performed the calculation: 100 - 75 = 25 push-ups more than Zachary. It turned out that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, reaching a total of 114 push-ups.John, another participant, joined the group for a workout session. He performed push-ups as part of a daily routine, aiming to surpass Zachary. John managed to do 46 push-ups that day. Comparing John's count to Zachary's, we can see that Zachary did 75 - 46 = 29 more push-ups than John.This push-up competition was not a one-time event but rather an ongoing effort to encourage healthy competition and motivate each other in their fitness journey. The objective of tracking how many more push-ups each person did was to gauge personal improvement, set new goals, and foster a sense of accomplishment within the group.

Therefore, the answer is 30

Question:For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks. If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the quantities and their respective requirements.
- Large planks: 12, needing 15 nails each.
- Small planks: 10, needing 5 nails each.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of nails needed for large planks.
- Total nails for large planks = Number of large planks × Nails per large plank
- Total nails for large planks = 12 × 15

Step 3: Calculate the total number of nails needed for small planks.
- Total nails for small planks = Number of small planks × Nails per small plank
- Total nails for small planks = 10 × 5

Step 4: Add the totals from both large and small planks to find the overall total.
- Total nails = Total nails for large planks + Total nails for small planks

Now let's do the calculations:

Total nails for large planks = 12 * 15 = 180 nails
Total nails for small planks = 10 * 5 = 50 nails

Total nails needed for the house wall = 180 nails (large) + 50 nails (small) = 230 nails

So, John needs 230 nails for the house walls.

Who is the subject performing the action in this situation (the one fitting the action figures)?4. Where are the action figures being placed? 5. In what context does Adam's room serve as a reference point for this problem?6. Why is it important to know the total number of action figures that can be held on the shelves and in the cabinets?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Adam's room, he has a unique setup for displaying his collection of action figures. To find out how many action figures can fit on one shelf, one would perform a simple division operation. Let's say each shelf has a capacity of 12 action figures, so the calculation would be: Number of action figures per shelf = Total shelf capacity / Shelves per unit. Once this is done, we can multiply the result by the number of shelves to get the total for one level.On all four shelves, the calculation would be: Total action figures on shelves = Number of action figures per shelf * 4. After determining the capacity of the shelves, we can then consider the additional storage provided by the cabinets. Assuming there are two cabinets, each capable of holding twice the number of figures as a single shelf, we calculate the cabinet storage as: Total cabinet capacity = (Number of action figures per shelf * 2) * Cabinets.The subject, Adam, is the one performing the action of arranging and calculating the space for his action figures. The action figures are being placed on the shelves and in the cabinets, creating a dedicated display area within his room. Knowing the total number of action figures that can be held on the shelves and cabinets is essential because it allows Adam to manage his collection effectively, ensuring that he has enough space and can showcase his favorite figures without overcrowding them. This information also helps him make decisions about purchasing new figurines or organizing his existing ones more efficiently.

Question:Each pack of dvds costs 107 dollars. If there is a discount of 106 dollars on each pack How many packs of dvds can you buy with 93 dollars?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:packs of dvds, costs, 107 dollars, discount, 106 dollars, 93 dollars.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the discounted price per pack of DVDs?2. What is the discounted price for one pack of DVDs after applying the $106 discount?3. Who is the beneficiary of the discount (buyer or seller) and how does it affect their purchasing power?4. In what context or situation would the calculation of the number of packs with a $93 budget take place?5. When might this scenario occur, such as during a sale or promotional event?6. Why is it important to calculate the number of packs with the given discount and budget, in terms of resource allocation or decision-making?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the discounted price per pack of DVDs, you would apply a percentage-based discount to the original price. For example, if the DVDs typically cost $20 per pack and there's a 25% discount, you would calculate the discounted price using the formula:Discounted Price = Original Price - (Original Price * Discount Percentage / 100)Let's say the discount is $106, which we can infer from the question. First, we need to find out the discount percentage by dividing the discount amount by the original price:Discount Percentage = Discount Amount / Original PriceIf the original price per pack is $20, then:Discount Percentage = $106 / $20 = 5.3%Now that we have the discount percentage, we can calculate the discounted price per pack:Discounted Price per Pack = $20 - ($20 * 5.3%)Assuming the calculation results in $18.78 per pack (rounded to the nearest cent), the beneficiary of this discount is the buyer, as it reduces the cost they need to pay for each pack. This increased purchasing power can encourage them to buy more packs within their budget.The scenario where this calculation takes place would be during a sale or promotional event, where retailers offer discounts to attract customers and increase sales volume. If a customer has a limited budget of $93 and wants to know how many packs of discounted DVDs they can afford, they would use the same discounted price per pack and divide their budget accordingly:Number of Packs = Budget / Discounted Price per PackCalculating the number of packs helps both the retailer in managing inventory and the buyer in making informed decisions about their spending. It ensures efficient resource allocation and enables them to make the most of the promotional offer.

Therefore, the answer is 93

Question:There are 17 different movies and 11 different books in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 13 of the books and watched 63 of the movies How many more movies than books are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.
- Movies: 17 different ones
- Books: 11 different ones
- Read: 13 books
- Watched: 63 movies
- Difference sought: More movies than books

Step 2: Calculate the number of movies watched more than books read.
- Movies watched excess: Total movies - Movies watched
- Books read excess: Total books - Books read

Step 3: Perform the calculations.
- Movies watched excess: 17 - 63 = -46 (since 63 is more than 17, it's a negative value)
- Books read excess: 11 - 13 = -2 (also a negative value, meaning 13 books were read more than the available 11)

Question:Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons. If he only had 492 crayons left How many crayons had been lost or given away?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Paul, box of crayons, birthday, gave to friends, 52 crayons, lost crayons, 535 crayons, left, 492 crayons..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) should be used to find out how many crayons Paul initially had before giving any to his friends or losing any?2. What is the total number of crayons that Paul either gave away or lost, considering both the 52 crayons to friends and the 535 crayons lost?3. Who are the beneficiaries of the 52 crayons that Paul gave away, and what was the reason for giving them the crayons?4. In what context did Paul receive the box of crayons as a birthday gift, and when did he start using or distributing them?5. Why does Paul need to calculate the total loss of crayons, and what might be the purpose of knowing this number?6. How can we determine the initial quantity of crayons Paul had in the box, using the information provided about the ones he gave away, lost, and had left?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul started with a box of crayons that he received as a birthday gift. He began using and distributing them at an unspecified time. One day, he decided to share his joy by giving away 52 crayons to his friends. This generous act was likely in response to their creative endeavors or simply to spread happiness.Unfortunately, Paul also experienced a setback when he accidentally lost 535 crayons, which significantly reduced the count. To find out how many crayons he initially had, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away and lost from the total amount he initially received.Let's denote the initial number of crayons as \( I \). After giving away 52 crayons, he had \( I - 52 \) left. Adding the 535 crayons he later lost, the equation becomes:\[ I - 52 + 535 = I \]Solving for \( I \), we get:\[ I + 483 = I \]\[ 483 = 52 \]So, initially, Paul had \( 483 + 52 \) crayons before any were given away or lost:\[ I = 535 \]In conclusion, Paul initially had 535 crayons in the box. The beneficiaries of the 52 crayons given away were his friends, and he shared them as a gesture of friendship. Calculating the total loss (535 - 52) helps Paul understand the extent of the reduction in his crayon collection, which might be important for replacing them, keeping track of personal items, or simply reflecting on the impact of his actions.

Therefore, the answer is 587

Question:Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 12 peaches How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jake, peaches, Steven, 16 fewer, Jill, 15 more, 12 peaches, more peaches than Jake.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Jake's situation involve (subtracting 16)?2. What is the relationship between Jill and Steven's peaches (Steven has 15 more)?3. How many peaches does Steven have (Jill's + 15)?4. How many peaches does Jake have (Steven's - 16)?5. In what comparison are we interested (Jill's peaches more than Jake's)?6. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake (Jill's - Jake's)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Jake's situation, he is involved in subtracting 16 from a quantity, which likely represents the number of peaches he has. Jill, on the other hand, has a certain number of peaches, and Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. To find out how many peaches Steven has, we can add 15 to Jill's count. Let's say Jill has x peaches, then Steven would have x + 15 peaches.Now, to determine how many peaches Jake has, we subtract 16 from Steven's total, so Jake has (x + 15) - 16 peaches. Simplifying this, we get x - 1 for Jake's peaches.The comparison we are interested in is whether Jill's peaches are more than Jake's. Since Jill has x peaches and Jake has x - 1, we can see that Jill indeed has one more peach than Jake.To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract Jake's count from Jill's: x - (x - 1) = 1.In summary, Jake's situation involves subtracting 16, and the comparison we're interested in is Jill having one more peach than Jake, with Jill having x + 15 peaches (where x is Jill's count) and Jake having x - 1 peaches. The difference between their counts is 1 peach.

Therefore, the answer is 1

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) should be used to find out how many crayons Paul initially had before giving any to his friends or losing any?2. What is the total number of crayons that Paul either gave away or lost, considering both the 52 crayons to friends and the 535 crayons lost?3. Who are the beneficiaries of the 52 crayons that Paul gave away, and what was the reason for giving them the crayons?4. In what context did Paul receive the box of crayons as a birthday gift, and when did he start using or distributing them?5. Why does Paul need to calculate the total loss of crayons, and what might be the purpose of knowing this number?6. How can we determine the initial quantity of crayons Paul had in the box, using the information provided about the ones he gave away, lost, and had left?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul started with a box of crayons that he received as a birthday gift. He began using and distributing them at an unspecified time. One day, he decided to share his joy by giving away 52 crayons to his friends. This generous act was likely in response to their creative endeavors or simply to spread happiness.Unfortunately, Paul also experienced a setback when he accidentally lost 535 crayons, which significantly reduced the count. To find out how many crayons he initially had, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away and lost from the total amount he initially received.Let's denote the initial number of crayons as \( I \). After giving away 52 crayons, he had \( I - 52 \) left. Adding the 535 crayons he later lost, the equation becomes:\[ I - 52 + 535 = I \]Solving for \( I \), we get:\[ I + 483 = I \]\[ 483 = 52 \]So, initially, Paul had \( 483 + 52 \) crayons before any were given away or lost:\[ I = 535 \]In conclusion, Paul initially had 535 crayons in the box. The beneficiaries of the 52 crayons given away were his friends, and he shared them as a gesture of friendship. Calculating the total loss (535 - 52) helps Paul understand the extent of the reduction in his crayon collection, which might be important for replacing them, keeping track of personal items, or simply reflecting on the impact of his actions.

Therefore, the answer is 587

Question:Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. Allan then bought 3 more balloons at the park. How many more balloons did Jake have than Allan in the park?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Allan, 2 balloons, Jake, 6 balloons, bought 3 more balloons, park, more balloons, had than Allan..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem require to compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's?2. What is the total number of balloons Allan had after buying more at the park?3. Who had more balloons initially before Allan bought any more?4. In what location did Allan buy the additional balloons?5. When did Allan buy the 3 more balloons at the park?6. Why is it necessary to find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's, we needed to perform an arithmetic operation, specifically subtraction. Initially, Allan had 10 balloons, while Jake had 15. The problem required subtracting Allan's initial count from Jake's to determine the difference: 15 (Jake's balloons) - 10 (Allan's initial balloons) = 5 balloons.After buying more at the park, Allan increased his total by 3 balloons. To find the new total, we added the additional balloons to his initial count: 10 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 13 balloons.Comparing their counts again, it's clear that Jake had more balloons initially, as he had 15 balloons compared to Allan's 10.Allan bought the extra 3 balloons at the park, but the exact time is not specified in the information provided. However, we can infer that it happened after the comparison with Jake.The reason for finding out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan is to establish a numerical advantage, which could be relevant to a competition, a game, or simply to understand the relative quantity each person had at that point in time. This comparison helps in determining who might have had the larger supply of balloons.

Therefore, the answer is 1

Question:Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Paul, box of crayons, birthday, lost or given away, 551 crayons, 177 crayons left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should Paul perform to find out how many crayons he initially had before losing or giving away any?2. What mathematical operation can be used to calculate the initial number of crayons Paul had if we know the number he lost or gave away and the ones he had left?3. Who are the parties involved in the situation where Paul lost or gave away crayons - Paul himself or someone else?4. Where did this situation occur - at home, school, or somewhere else?5. When did Paul receive the box of crayons, and when did he lose or give them away?6. Why is it important to determine the initial number of crayons? Could it be related to a ratio or understanding the distribution?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul found himself in a situation where he wanted to recall the number of crayons he initially had before any losses or gifts occurred. To solve this, he needed to perform an addition operation. If he knew the exact number of crayons he had lost or given away, say it was 15, and the remaining count was 30, he could use the formula for subtraction to find the initial quantity:Initial Number = Remaining Crayons + Lost or Given Away CrayonsIn this case, the calculation would be:Initial Number = 30 (crayons left) + 15 (lost or given away)Adding these together gives us:Initial Number = 45 crayonsThe parties involved in this situation were Paul himself, as he was both the one who received the box of crayons and experienced the loss or giveaway. This incident took place at home, likely during a time when he was engaged in creative activities with his children or simply organizing his belongings.Determining the initial number of crayons was crucial for Paul because it allowed him to understand the distribution or ratio of crayons before and after the loss or donation. This could be significant if he needed to replenish his supply based on a specific ratio or if he wanted to account for the change in his art supplies. By knowing the starting point, Paul could make informed decisions about purchasing new crayons or redistributing what he still had.

Question:There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left. How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Olivia's wallet, 3 dollars, 49 dollars, ATM, supermarket, 49 dollars left, more money collected, supermarket spent.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Olivia perform when she adds the money in her wallet to the amount collected at the ATM?2. What is the total amount of money Olivia had after collecting from the ATM?3. Who is the entity that spends money at the supermarket - Olivia or the supermarket itself?4. Where does Olivia spend the money, specifically at the ATM or the supermarket?5. When does Olivia find out how much money she has left after the supermarket visit?6. How much did Olivia initially spend at the supermarket if she had 49 dollars left after the transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Olivia engages in the mathematical operation of addition when she combines the money in her wallet with the amount she collects at the ATM. After an ATM withdrawal, she discovers that her total amount is $85. During her shopping trip to the supermarket, it is typically the spender, in this case, Olivia, who uses the money. She spends the money she had, which was a combination of the wallet's contents and the ATM cash. Upon returning from the supermarket, where she spent an undisclosed amount, Olivia calculates how much money she has left. If she had $49 left after the supermarket visit, we can determine the initial supermarket expenditure by subtracting the remaining amount from the total amount she had before the transaction. To find the initial supermarket expenditure, we can use the formula:Initial supermarket expenditure = Total amount before supermarket - Amount left after supermarketLet's denote the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket as \( S \). So,\( S = \$85 - \$49 \)Calculating this, we get:\( S = \$36 \)Therefore, Olivia initially spent $36 at the supermarket.

Therefore, the answer is 46

Question:Olivia spent 78 dollars at a supermarket. If she has 33 dollars left with her How much money did she have initially?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Olivia, 78 dollars, supermarket, 33 dollars, initially..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Olivia need to perform to find out how much money she had initially?2. What mathematical operation can be used to determine the initial amount of money Olivia had?3. Who is the subject in this financial transaction, and what is their initial amount of money?4. Where did Olivia make the purchase, and where did she have the remaining money after that?5. When did Olivia conduct this transaction, and how can we infer her initial funds based on the given information?6. Why is it important to know Olivia's initial amount of money if she spent 78 dollars at the supermarket and has 33 dollars left?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Olivia needed to subtract the amount she spent from the total money she had after the purchase to find out her initial amount. By using the subtraction operation, we can determine her initial funds. In this case, Olivia made a purchase at the supermarket, spending 78 dollars. After the transaction, she had 33 dollars left. To calculate her initial amount, we would subtract the 33 dollars she has now from the 78 dollars she spent:Initial Amount = Amount Spent - Remaining MoneyInitial Amount = $78 - $33Performing the calculation, we find that Olivia initially had $111. The subject in this financial transaction is Olivia, and her initial amount of money was $111. Knowing her initial funds is crucial because it helps us understand how much money she started with before the supermarket visit, which was her total available budget. Had she spent all her initial money, the remaining 33 dollars would indicate that she had $111 to begin with.

Therefore, the answer is 111

Question:Baker made 99 cakes. He bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 cakes. How many more cakes did baker buy than those he sold?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Baker, cakes, 99 cakes, bought, 167 new cakes, sold, 89 cakes, more cakes bought, than, sold..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Baker perform with the 99 cakes he initially made?2. What is the total number of cakes Baker had after buying new ones?3. Who are the two parties involved in the comparison of cake quantities?4. Where does the comparison between the number of cakes bought and sold take place?5. When does the action of buying and selling cakes occur in relation to Baker's overall process?6. Why is it important to find out how many more cakes Baker bought than he sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Baker, an enthusiastic baker, began his day by making a substantial batch of 99 delicious cakes. As the day progressed, he decided to expand his offerings by purchasing additional cakes from a neighboring bakery. To calculate the total number of cakes Baker had after the purchase, we simply add the initial quantity to the newly bought ones. If Baker bought 50 more cakes, we can perform the calculation: 99 (initial cakes) + 50 (bought cakes) = 149 cakes.The comparison between the number of cakes Baker bought and those he sold took place at the end of his busy day when he was tallying up his inventory. This evaluation is crucial because it helps Baker understand his profit or loss from the baking business, as well as his overall success in managing the quantity of cakes throughout the day.In terms of the timeline, the buying and selling of cakes occurred after the initial production, during the course of his operations. The comparison serves as a benchmark for determining whether Baker's sales were sufficient to cover his expenses and meet customer demand.To find out how many more cakes Baker bought than he sold, we would need the exact number of cakes he sold. Without that figure, we cannot directly determine the difference. However, if we know the number of cakes sold, subtracting it from the total number of cakes (149) would provide us with the surplus, which represents the cakes Baker bought but didn't sell.

Therefore, the answer is 78

Question:Dan has $ 4. He bought 99 candy bar for $ 3 each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the problem.
- Dan has $4.
- He bought 99 candy bars.
- Each candy bar costs $3.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the candy bars.
- Multiply the number of candy bars by the cost per bar: 99 candy bars * $3/candy bar.

Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the initial amount Dan had.
- Subtract the total cost from $4 to find out how much money is left.

Let's do the calculations:

Total cost of candy bars = 99 * $3
Total cost of candy bars = $297

Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $4 - $297

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

Money left = -$293

However, since it's not possible to have a negative amount of money, there seems to be an error in the problem statement. It's likely that Dan couldn't afford to buy 99 candy bars at $3 each with only $4. Assuming the price of each candy bar is less than or equal to $4, we should adjust the problem accordingly.

If each candy bar costs exactly $4 (which is the maximum amount Dan has), then he could buy only one candy bar and have no money left. If the cost per candy bar is less than $4, then Dan would be able to buy more than one and have some money left over.

Please clarify the cost per candy bar to provide an accurate answer.

Why does Paul need to calculate the total loss of crayons, and what might be the purpose of knowing this number?6. How can we determine the initial quantity of crayons Paul had in the box, using the information provided about the ones he gave away, lost, and had left?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul started with a box of crayons that he received as a birthday gift. He began using and distributing them at an unspecified time. One day, he decided to share his joy by giving away 52 crayons to his friends. This generous act was likely in response to their creative endeavors or simply to spread happiness.Unfortunately, Paul also experienced a setback when he accidentally lost 535 crayons, which significantly reduced the count. To find out how many crayons he initially had, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away and lost from the total amount he initially received.Let's denote the initial number of crayons as \( I \). After giving away 52 crayons, he had \( I - 52 \) left. Adding the 535 crayons he later lost, the equation becomes:\[ I - 52 + 535 = I \]Solving for \( I \), we get:\[ I + 483 = I \]\[ 483 = 52 \]So, initially, Paul had \( 483 + 52 \) crayons before any were given away or lost:\[ I = 535 \]In conclusion, Paul initially had 535 crayons in the box. The beneficiaries of the 52 crayons given away were his friends, and he shared them as a gesture of friendship. Calculating the total loss (535 - 52) helps Paul understand the extent of the reduction in his crayon collection, which might be important for replacing them, keeping track of personal items, or simply reflecting on the impact of his actions.

Before this morning, she had baked a total of 100 cookies, with an equal number of chocolate chip and raisin varieties. Yesterday, she focused on raisin cookies, baking half of her total cookie count. To find out how many raisin cookies she made yesterday, we can divide the total number of cookies by 2:\( \frac{100 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 50 \text{ raisin cookies} \)This morning, she baked another batch, which was also a third of her total cookie count at that point. Since she had already baked 50 raisin cookies, this would be:\( \frac{100 \text{ cookies} - 50 \text{ (yesterday's raisin cookies)}}{3} \)\( \frac{50 \text{ cookies}}{3} \approx 16.67 \)Rounded to the nearest whole number, she baked approximately 17 raisin cookies this morning.The cookies were being prepared for Thanksgiving, a time when families gather to share delicious treats. The baking activity took place at Helen's cozy house, where she has all the necessary ingredients and equipment. Helen was baking so many cookies not just for personal consumption but also as gifts for friends and neighbors, to spread the holiday cheer.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find out how many children were initially on the bus before the stop if there were 30 children in total after some got off?2. What calculation should be performed to determine how many children were on the bus before 82 children got on?3. Who are the subjects in the scenario that involve getting on and getting off the bus? 4. Where does this situation take place - at the bus stop, on the bus, or elsewhere?5. When did the events of children getting on and off the bus occur in relation to the initial count of 28 children?6. Why is it necessary to find out the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off the bus?7. How can we solve for the unknown number of children who got off the bus using the given information about the total number of children and the ones that boarded?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a transportation scenario, the bus started with an initial count of 28 children. At a certain stop, some children got off, resulting in 30 children remaining on the bus. To determine how many children were initially on the bus before the stop, you would need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total count after the stop. This can be calculated using the formula:Initial children = Total children after stop - Children who got offLet's denote the number of children who got off as 'x'. So, we have:28 (initial children) = 30 (total after stop) - x (children got off)Solving for 'x', we get:x = 30 - 28x = 2Therefore, there were 2 children who got off the bus.Later, 82 children got on the bus. To find out how many children were on the bus before this event, we add the number of children who got on to the remaining count after the first stop:Children on the bus before 82 got on = 30 (after the first stop) + 82 (got on)Calculating this sum:30 + 82 = 112So, there were 112 children on the bus before 82 more joined.The subjects in this situation are the children, as they are the ones boarding and disembarking the bus. The events took place at a bus stop, where passengers typically alight and board the vehicle.In terms of timing, the events occurred after the initial count of 28 children, specifically after some got off and before 82 got on. Knowing the difference between these two actions is crucial for understanding the bus's occupancy throughout the journey.To find out why it's necessary to determine these differences, consider that it helps track changes in the bus's capacity and could be relevant for planning, safety, or resource allocation. By subtracting the number of children who left (got off) from the total, we can accurately account for the initial count before additional passengers joined.

Question:Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends How many cakes did each person eat?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.
- Matthew has 29 crackers and 30 cakes.
- Matthew gives equal amounts of crackers and cakes to 2 friends.
- We need to find out how many cakes each friend ate.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of crackers and cakes given away.
- Since Matthew gives equal amounts, we first need to find out how many crackers and cakes he gives away in total.
- Let's assume he gives x crackers and x cakes to each friend.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crackers and cakes given.
- Total crackers given = 2 * x
- Total cakes given = 2 * x

Step 4: Find the value of x.
- Since Matthew starts with 29 crackers and gives away x, the remaining crackers will be 29 - 2x.
- Similarly, since he starts with 30 cakes and gives away x, the remaining cakes will be 30 - 2x.

Step 5: Since Matthew has no crackers or cakes left after giving to his friends, the remaining amounts must be zero.
- 29 - 2x = 0 (for crackers)
- 30 - 2x = 0 (for cakes)

Solving these equations simultaneously:
- From the first equation, we get x = 29/2 = 14.5 (since you can't have half a cracker, we'll round down to 14 crackers).
- From the second equation, we also get x = 30/2 = 15 cakes.

Step 6: Since x represents the number of crackers and cakes given to each friend, and we rounded down to 14 crackers, we'll use 15 cakes as the answer because it's the whole number that corresponds to the equal distribution.

Answer: Each friend ate 15 cakes.

Question:Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 85 raisin cookies and 403 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Helen, hippo, friends, Thanksgiving, Helen's house, raisin cookies, 144 chocolate chip cookies, 397 raisin cookies, 85 raisin cookies, 403 chocolate chip cookies..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which type of cookies did Helen bake more of, chocolate chip or raisin, before this morning?2. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake in total yesterday?3. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake this morning?4. In what event or celebration were the cookies prepared - Thanksgiving or some other occasion?5. Where was the baking activity taking place - at Helen's house or elsewhere?6. Why was Helen baking so many cookies - for a gathering, personal consumption, or gift-giving?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Helen, an avid baker, had been preparing cookies for an upcoming event. Before this morning, she had baked a total of 100 cookies, with an equal number of chocolate chip and raisin varieties. Yesterday, she focused on raisin cookies, baking half of her total cookie count. To find out how many raisin cookies she made yesterday, we can divide the total number of cookies by 2:\( \frac{100 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 50 \text{ raisin cookies} \)This morning, she baked another batch, which was also a third of her total cookie count at that point. Since she had already baked 50 raisin cookies, this would be:\( \frac{100 \text{ cookies} - 50 \text{ (yesterday's raisin cookies)}}{3} \)\( \frac{50 \text{ cookies}}{3} \approx 16.67 \)Rounded to the nearest whole number, she baked approximately 17 raisin cookies this morning.The cookies were being prepared for Thanksgiving, a time when families gather to share delicious treats. The baking activity took place at Helen's cozy house, where she has all the necessary ingredients and equipment. Helen was baking so many cookies not just for personal consumption but also as gifts for friends and neighbors, to spread the holiday cheer.

Question:Baker made 170 cakes. He sold 78 of them and bought 31 new cakes. How many more cakes did baker sell than those he bought?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Baker, cakes, 170 cakes, sold, 78 cakes, bought, 31 new cakes, more cakes, sold than bought..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many cakes Baker had left after selling some?2. What calculation is needed to determine the total number of cakes Baker had before buying more?3. Who performed the action of selling cakes, and how many cakes were involved in this transaction?4. In what context did Baker's sales take place (e.g., bakery, event, etc.)?5. When did Baker make the initial batch of 170 cakes, and when did he buy the additional 31 cakes?6. To find out the difference between the number of cakes sold and bought, what kind of subtraction is required?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Baker, an experienced baker, started his day by making a batch of 170 delicious cakes at his cozy bakery. Customers began purchasing them throughout the morning, and to keep up with demand, he made another purchase of 31 cakes from a neighboring supplier. To determine how many cakes he had left after selling some, he needed to subtract the number of cakes sold from the initial batch plus the additional ones.To calculate the total number of cakes Baker had before selling any, he simply added the initial batch to the new ones he bought:Total cakes before sales = Initial batch + Cakes boughtTotal cakes before sales = 170 + 31After performing the addition, we find that Baker had 201 cakes before any sales took place.The sales occurred at the bakery during a local event, where Baker's cakes were in high demand. During the event, he sold an impressive number of 95 cakes. To find out the difference between the number of cakes sold and bought, a subtraction operation was necessary:Cakes left = Total cakes before sales - Cakes soldCakes left = 201 - 95By subtracting 95 from 201, we get the final result:Cakes left = 106So, after selling 95 cakes and buying 31 more, Baker was left with 106 cakes in his bakery.

Question:Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons. If he only had 492 crayons left How many crayons had been lost or given away?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Paul, box of crayons, birthday, gave to friends, 52 crayons, lost crayons, 535 crayons, left, 492 crayons..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) should be used to find out how many crayons Paul initially had before giving any to his friends or losing any?2. What is the total number of crayons that Paul either gave away or lost, considering both the 52 crayons to friends and the 535 crayons lost?3. Who are the beneficiaries of the 52 crayons that Paul gave away, and what was the reason for giving them the crayons?4. In what context did Paul receive the box of crayons as a birthday gift, and when did he start using or distributing them?5. Why does Paul need to calculate the total loss of crayons, and what might be the purpose of knowing this number?6. How can we determine the initial quantity of crayons Paul had in the box, using the information provided about the ones he gave away, lost, and had left?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul started with a box of crayons that he received as a birthday gift. He began using and distributing them at an unspecified time. One day, he decided to share his joy by giving away 52 crayons to his friends. This generous act was likely in response to their creative endeavors or simply to spread happiness.Unfortunately, Paul also experienced a setback when he accidentally lost 535 crayons, which significantly reduced the count. To find out how many crayons he initially had, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away and lost from the total amount he initially received.Let's denote the initial number of crayons as \( I \). After giving away 52 crayons, he had \( I - 52 \) left. Adding the 535 crayons he later lost, the equation becomes:\[ I - 52 + 535 = I \]Solving for \( I \), we get:\[ I + 483 = I \]\[ 483 = 52 \]So, initially, Paul had \( 483 + 52 \) crayons before any were given away or lost:\[ I = 535 \]In conclusion, Paul initially had 535 crayons in the box. The beneficiaries of the 52 crayons given away were his friends, and he shared them as a gesture of friendship. Calculating the total loss (535 - 52) helps Paul understand the extent of the reduction in his crayon collection, which might be important for replacing them, keeping track of personal items, or simply reflecting on the impact of his actions.

Therefore, the answer is 587

Question:Baker made 99 cakes. He bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 cakes. How many more cakes did baker buy than those he sold?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Baker, cakes, 99 cakes, bought, 167 new cakes, sold, 89 cakes, more cakes bought, than, sold..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Baker perform with the 99 cakes he initially made?2. What is the total number of cakes Baker had after buying new ones?3. Who are the two parties involved in the comparison of cake quantities?4. Where does the comparison between the number of cakes bought and sold take place?5. When does the action of buying and selling cakes occur in relation to Baker's overall process?6. Why is it important to find out how many more cakes Baker bought than he sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Baker, an enthusiastic baker, began his day by making a substantial batch of 99 delicious cakes. As the day progressed, he decided to expand his offerings by purchasing additional cakes from a neighboring bakery. To calculate the total number of cakes Baker had after the purchase, we simply add the initial quantity to the newly bought ones. If Baker bought 50 more cakes, we can perform the calculation: 99 (initial cakes) + 50 (bought cakes) = 149 cakes.The comparison between the number of cakes Baker bought and those he sold took place at the end of his busy day when he was tallying up his inventory. This evaluation is crucial because it helps Baker understand his profit or loss from the baking business, as well as his overall success in managing the quantity of cakes throughout the day.In terms of the timeline, the buying and selling of cakes occurred after the initial production, during the course of his operations. The comparison serves as a benchmark for determining whether Baker's sales were sufficient to cover his expenses and meet customer demand.To find out how many more cakes Baker bought than he sold, we would need the exact number of cakes he sold. Without that figure, we cannot directly determine the difference. However, if we know the number of cakes sold, subtracting it from the total number of cakes (149) would provide us with the surplus, which represents the cakes Baker bought but didn't sell.

Therefore, the answer is 78

Question:Paul got a box of 589 crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 571 crayons to his friends while he lost 161 crayons. How many more crayons did he give to his friends than those he lost?

Question:Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rachel, picked, 6 ripe apples, her tree, 2 ripe apples, 4 unripe apples, the tree, begin with..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should we perform to find out how many apples the tree had initially before Rachel picked any?2. What calculation would help us determine the total number of apples on the tree before Rachel's harvest?3. Who or what was the subject having the initial number of apples on the tree?4. Where does the information about the 6 ripe apples picked by Rachel fit into the overall problem?5. When did the situation take place where Rachel picked the apples and the tree's count was recorded?6. Why is it important to know the initial number of apples on the tree if we already have the current counts?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a scenario involving an apple tree, the initial number of apples can be determined through a simple mathematical operation. To find out how many apples the tree had before Rachel's harvest, we would need to subtract the number of apples she picked from the current count. Let's denote the initial count as I and the number of ripe apples Rachel picked as R, which in this case is 6.For calculation step 1, we would use the formula:Initial Apples (I) = Current Apples - Apples Picked (R)So, if we know the current count after Rachel's picking, we would subtract 6 from that number.To determine the total number of apples on the tree before Rachel's harvest (step 2), we would add the 6 apples she picked back to the initial count:Total Apples Before Harvest = Initial Apples + Apples PickedThe subject having the initial number of apples was the tree (step 3), and the information about the 6 ripe apples picked by Rachel (step 4) serves as a crucial piece of data that affects the initial count.This situation took place at a specific point in time when Rachel's picking occurred (step 5), and knowing the initial count is important because it allows us to understand the tree's state before any external intervention, such as Rachel's harvest, altered the numbers (step 6). By calculating the initial quantity, we can analyze the tree's growth, potential yield, or any changes that might have occurred naturally.

Therefore, the answer is 12

Question:Haley grew 9 trees in her backyard. After a typhoon 4 died. Then she grew 5 more trees. How many trees does she have left?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Haley, trees, backyard, 9 trees, typhoon, 4 died, 5 more trees, left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did Haley perform first: growing 9 trees or losing 4 trees due to the typhoon?2. What is the result of subtracting the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees Haley grew?3. Who experienced the loss of trees after the typhoon? 4. In what location did Haley grow the trees?5. When did the typhoon occur in relation to Haley's tree-growing activity?6. How many trees did Haley have after she grew an additional 5 trees following the typhoon?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Haley began her tree-growing project by planting 9 trees. Unfortunately, a typhoon struck and resulted in the loss of 4 trees. To find out which operation she performed first, we consider the sequence of events. Since the growing occurred before the typhoon, Haley grew the trees first. After subtracting the trees that died due to the typhoon from the initial growth, the result would be:Initial growth: 9 treesLoss from typhoon: -4 treesResulting trees: 9 - 4 = 5 treesThe loss of trees after the typhoon affected Haley's count. The location where she grew the trees is not specified in the given information. However, the passage states that the typhoon occurred after the initial growth, so it was during or after the time she started growing trees.After the typhoon, Haley decided to add more trees to her collection. She grew an additional 5 trees, so to find out how many trees she had in total after this addition, we simply add the surviving trees to the new growth:Surviving trees: 5 (from the typhoon)Additional growth: +5 treesTotal trees after typhoon and growth: 5 + 5 = 10 treesIn summary, Haley grew 9 trees first, and then lost 4 to the typhoon, leaving her with 5 trees. After the typhoon, she added 5 more trees, resulting in a total of 10 trees. The exact location of the tree-growing and the timing relative to the typhoon are not provided in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is 10

Question:Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Adam, Jackie, 12 apples, 9 apples more, Adam and Jackie together, 8 more apples than Jackie, He..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) can be used to find out how many apples Jackie has if Adam has 8 more apples than she does?2. What equation represents the relationship between the number of apples Adam has, Jackie has, and the total they have together (12 apples)?3. Who has the greater number of apples, Adam or Jackie, and by how many apples?4. In what context is this problem set, i.e., are they sharing apples, dividing them, or comparing individual quantities?5. When does the problem take place, is it a static situation or does it involve a dynamic change in the number of apples?6. Why does "He" have 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined? Is there a specific reason or rule provided for this difference?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a simple arithmetic scenario, Jackie and Adam are comparing their apple collections. To determine how many apples Jackie has, we need to subtract 8 from the number of apples Adam possesses. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, if we let J represent the number of apples Jackie has and A represent Adam's, the equation would be A = J + 8. To find Jackie's apples, we can rearrange the equation to solve for J: J = A - 8. For instance, if Adam has 16 apples (let's assume this for illustration), then Jackie would have 16 - 8 = 8 apples.The relationship between the number of apples they both have and the total can be represented by the equation: J + A = 12. This means that together, Jackie and Adam possess a total of 12 apples. To find out how many apples each person has individually, we can substitute one person's quantity with the sum minus the other's. If we know Jackie has 8 and their combined total is 12, then Adam must have 12 - 8 = 4 apples.Comparing their quantities, Adam has more apples than Jackie, specifically by a difference of 8 - 4 = 4 apples. This problem seems to revolve around comparing individual quantities, rather than sharing or dividing them.The context suggests that the situation is static, as it doesn't indicate any change over time or transactions involving the apples. The reason "He" has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined could be a separate piece of information not provided here, but it implies that there is an additional person or perhaps a different context where this extra quantity comes into play. Without further details, it's impossible to determine the exact cause for this difference.

Therefore, the answer is 21

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Allan, 2 balloons, Jake, 6 balloons, bought 3 more balloons, park, more balloons, had than Allan..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem require to compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's?2. What is the total number of balloons Allan had after buying more at the park?3. Who had more balloons initially before Allan bought any more?4. In what location did Allan buy the additional balloons?5. When did Allan buy the 3 more balloons at the park?6. Why is it necessary to find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's, we needed to perform an arithmetic operation, specifically subtraction. Initially, Allan had 10 balloons, while Jake had 15. The problem required subtracting Allan's initial count from Jake's to determine the difference: 15 (Jake's balloons) - 10 (Allan's initial balloons) = 5 balloons.After buying more at the park, Allan increased his total by 3 balloons. To find the new total, we added the additional balloons to his initial count: 10 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 13 balloons.Comparing their counts again, it's clear that Jake had more balloons initially, as he had 15 balloons compared to Allan's 10.Allan bought the extra 3 balloons at the park, but the exact time is not specified in the information provided. However, we can infer that it happened after the comparison with Jake.The reason for finding out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan is to establish a numerical advantage, which could be relevant to a competition, a game, or simply to understand the relative quantity each person had at that point in time. This comparison helps in determining who might have had the larger supply of balloons.

Question:Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 12 peaches How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jake, peaches, Steven, 16 fewer, Jill, 15 more, 12 peaches, more peaches than Jake.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Jake's situation involve (subtracting 16)?2. What is the relationship between Jill and Steven's peaches (Steven has 15 more)?3. How many peaches does Steven have (Jill's + 15)?4. How many peaches does Jake have (Steven's - 16)?5. In what comparison are we interested (Jill's peaches more than Jake's)?6. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake (Jill's - Jake's)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Jake's situation, he is involved in subtracting 16 from a quantity, which likely represents the number of peaches he has. Jill, on the other hand, has a certain number of peaches, and Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. To find out how many peaches Steven has, we can add 15 to Jill's count. Let's say Jill has x peaches, then Steven would have x + 15 peaches.Now, to determine how many peaches Jake has, we subtract 16 from Steven's total, so Jake has (x + 15) - 16 peaches. Simplifying this, we get x - 1 for Jake's peaches.The comparison we are interested in is whether Jill's peaches are more than Jake's. Since Jill has x peaches and Jake has x - 1, we can see that Jill indeed has one more peach than Jake.To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract Jake's count from Jill's: x - (x - 1) = 1.In summary, Jake's situation involves subtracting 16, and the comparison we're interested in is Jill having one more peach than Jake, with Jill having x + 15 peaches (where x is Jill's count) and Jake having x - 1 peaches. The difference between their counts is 1 peach.

Therefore, the answer is 1

Question:Steven has 12 peaches. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven who has 67 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the relationships between the quantities given.
- Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven.
- Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill.

Step 2: Translate these relationships into equations.
- Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as J. According to the second relationship, Steven has J + 67 peaches.
- Since Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has (J + 67) - 4 peaches.

Step 3: We know that Steven has 12 peaches, so we can substitute this value into the equation for Steven's peaches.
- J + 67 = 12 (since Steven has 12 peaches)

Step 4: Solve for J (the number of peaches Jill has).
- J = 12 - 67
- J = -55 (This is not possible because the number of peaches cannot be negative.)

Step 5: There seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement. It's not possible for Steven to have 67 more peaches than Jill if Jill has -55 peaches. Let's assume there was a mistake in the problem and Jill actually has a positive number of peaches.

Step 6: Since the problem states that Jill has 12 peaches less than the correct amount, let's adjust Jill's peaches to a positive number that makes sense in the context of the problem.
- Let's say Jill has 0 peaches instead of -55, as that would make more sense.

Step 7: Now, we can use this corrected value for Jill's peaches to find out how many peaches Jake has.
- J = 0 (Jill has 0 peaches)
- Steven has 67 more than Jill, so Steven has 67 peaches (12 + 67 = 79)
- Jake has 4 fewer than Steven, so Jake has 79 - 4 peaches.

Step 8: Calculate Jake's peaches.
- Jake's peaches = 79 - 4
- Jake's peaches = 75

So, Jake has 75 peaches. However, it's important to note that the original problem statement may have been incorrect or incomplete, leading to the inconsistency in the values. With the assumption that Jill has 0 peaches, Jake would have 75 peaches. If the problem meant to say that Jill has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, then the calculation would be different, but based on the information provided, Jake would still have 75 peaches.

Question:Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Zachary, push-ups, 15, David, 39 more, John, 9 push-ups less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to compare the number of push-ups Zachary did with David's?2. What calculation does David perform on Zachary's number of push-ups to find his own count?3. Who did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, and how many push-ups did David do in total?4. In what context did John perform push-ups, and how many push-ups did he do compared to Zachary?5. When did this situation occur - was it a one-time event or part of a routine?6. Why is it important to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John? (Objective or purpose)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a friendly competition to maintain fitness, Zachary and David engaged in a push-up challenge. To compare their progress, they used the comparison operator "more than" or "greater than" (>). Zachary had completed 75 push-ups, while David wanted to know his own count relative to Zachary's. To find out how many push-ups he needed to do, David subtracted Zachary's count from his target, which would be represented by the formula: David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + additional push-ups.David calculated that he needed to do 100 push-ups in total, so he performed the calculation: 100 - 75 = 25 push-ups more than Zachary. It turned out that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, reaching a total of 114 push-ups.John, another participant, joined the group for a workout session. He performed push-ups as part of a daily routine, aiming to surpass Zachary. John managed to do 46 push-ups that day. Comparing John's count to Zachary's, we can see that Zachary did 75 - 46 = 29 more push-ups than John.This push-up competition was not a one-time event but rather an ongoing effort to encourage healthy competition and motivate each other in their fitness journey. The objective of tracking how many more push-ups each person did was to gauge personal improvement, set new goals, and foster a sense of accomplishment within the group.

Question:Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the relationships between the characters and their peach counts.
- Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven.
- Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill.

Step 2: Use the given information about Steven's peaches to find Jake's and Jill's counts.
- Given that Steven has 16 peaches, we can calculate Jake's peaches by subtracting 9 from Steven's:
   Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 9
   Jake's peaches = 16 - 9
   Jake's peaches = 7

Step 3: Now that we know Jake has 7 peaches, we can find Jill's peaches by adding 18 to Jake's count:
   Jill's peaches = Jake's peaches + 18
   Jill's peaches = 7 + 18
   Jill's peaches = 25

Step 4: Compare the number of peaches Steven has to the number Jill has to find the difference:
   Difference = Steven's peaches - Jill's peaches
   Difference = 16 - 25

Step 5: Calculate the difference:
   Difference = -9

So, Steven has 9 fewer peaches than Jill.

Question:There are 6 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 16 red peaches and 18 green peaches. How many red peaches are in the baskets altogether?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6 baskets, peaches, 16 red peaches, basket, red peaches..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the total number of red peaches?2. What is the multiplication factor when calculating the total red peaches from one basket?3. Who are the entities involved in this problem (the ones whose peaches we're counting)?4. Where are the baskets located in relation to the count of red peaches?5. When does the counting of red peaches take place (is it a continuous or instantaneous action)?6. Why is it important to know the total number of red peaches in all baskets?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where baskets filled with peaches are being counted, to find the total number of red peaches, we first need to perform the arithmetic operation of addition. This operation is applied to the quantity of red peaches present in each individual basket. The multiplication factor comes into play when calculating the combined total, as it's the number of baskets that need to be multiplied by the count in one basket. For instance, if each basket contains 10 red peaches and there are 5 baskets, the multiplication factor would be 5.The entities involved in this problem are the owners or distributors of the baskets, whose red peaches we're counting. The baskets themselves are located at different spots, but their red peaches' count is the focus of the inquiry. The counting of red peaches takes place at a single point in time, as it's an instantaneous action rather than a continuous process.It's crucial to know the total number of red peaches in all baskets for several reasons. First, it helps in inventory management, ensuring accurate stock information. Second, it might be relevant for determining the cost or pricing if the peaches are for sale. Lastly, if there's a target quantity to meet, knowing the combined total aids in meeting the goal or making decisions about distribution or transportation.

Therefore, the answer is 96

Question:There are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 345 groups and oranges are organized into 16 groups How big is each group of oranges?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:oranges, Philip's collection, 384 oranges, bananas, 192 bananas, groups of bananas, 345 groups, groups of oranges.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many oranges are in each group of oranges?2. What is the formula to calculate the size of each group of oranges if there are 384 oranges in total and they are organized into 16 groups?3. Who is responsible for organizing the oranges and bananas into groups, Philip or someone else?4. In what context does Philip have this collection of oranges and bananas, a personal collection or for some experiment?5. Is there a specific reason or purpose for Philip to know the size of each group of oranges, like a school assignment or a party preparation?6. How can we find the number of oranges per group by using the given information about the total number of oranges and the total number of groups for oranges?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine the number of oranges in each group, one would perform a division operation. If there are 384 oranges in total and they are organized into 16 groups, you can calculate the size of each group using the formula: Number of oranges per group = Total number of oranges / Number of groups. Applying this formula, we get 384 ÷ 16 = 24 oranges per group.Philip, it seems, is responsible for organizing the oranges and bananas into these groups. The context suggests that this collection might be part of a personal project or an experiment, though the exact purpose isn't specified. It's important for Philip to know the size of each group, possibly for a school assignment where they need to divide the fruits evenly or for preparing a party where portion control is required. By dividing the total number of oranges (384) by the number of groups (16), Philip ensures an equal distribution of oranges for whatever task at hand.

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rebecca found herself with a collection of eggs that she needed to organize efficiently. To find out how many times 5 could fit into her collection, she performed a simple division operation: 15 eggs divided by 5 equals 3. This meant that she could form complete groups of 5 eggs three times.The next step was to determine the total number of groups that could be formed with her 15 eggs. Since each group consisted of 5 eggs, she applied the same formula: 15 eggs divided by 5 eggs per group equals 3 groups. This calculation would ensure all eggs were utilized equally.Rebecca's mother, who valued organization and fairness, was responsible for splitting the eggs. The task was relevant because it would help them manage the eggs effectively and prevent any waste or spoilage, especially if they had a specific event coming up – a family gathering where they planned to bake a cake that required 15 eggs.Rebecca decided to carry out this grouping process in the kitchen, her usual hub for such activities. She planned to execute this task on Saturday morning, a few days before the event, to ensure the eggs were properly sorted and ready for use.The reason behind splitting the eggs into groups of 5 was for the upcoming recipe, which called for an exact quantity of 15 eggs evenly distributed among the groups. This precision would guarantee the perfect consistency in their baked goods, making the event all the more enjoyable for their guests.

Question:Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Adam, Jackie, 12 apples, 9 apples more, Adam and Jackie together, 8 more apples than Jackie, He..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) can be used to find out how many apples Jackie has if Adam has 8 more apples than she does?2. What equation represents the relationship between the number of apples Adam has, Jackie has, and the total they have together (12 apples)?3. Who has the greater number of apples, Adam or Jackie, and by how many apples?4. In what context is this problem set, i.e., are they sharing apples, dividing them, or comparing individual quantities?5. When does the problem take place, is it a static situation or does it involve a dynamic change in the number of apples?6. Why does "He" have 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined? Is there a specific reason or rule provided for this difference?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a simple arithmetic scenario, Jackie and Adam are comparing their apple collections. To determine how many apples Jackie has, we need to subtract 8 from the number of apples Adam possesses. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, if we let J represent the number of apples Jackie has and A represent Adam's, the equation would be A = J + 8. To find Jackie's apples, we can rearrange the equation to solve for J: J = A - 8. For instance, if Adam has 16 apples (let's assume this for illustration), then Jackie would have 16 - 8 = 8 apples.The relationship between the number of apples they both have and the total can be represented by the equation: J + A = 12. This means that together, Jackie and Adam possess a total of 12 apples. To find out how many apples each person has individually, we can substitute one person's quantity with the sum minus the other's. If we know Jackie has 8 and their combined total is 12, then Adam must have 12 - 8 = 4 apples.Comparing their quantities, Adam has more apples than Jackie, specifically by a difference of 8 - 4 = 4 apples. This problem seems to revolve around comparing individual quantities, rather than sharing or dividing them.The context suggests that the situation is static, as it doesn't indicate any change over time or transactions involving the apples. The reason "He" has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined could be a separate piece of information not provided here, but it implies that there is an additional person or perhaps a different context where this extra quantity comes into play. Without further details, it's impossible to determine the exact cause for this difference.

Therefore, the answer is 21

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Haley, trees, backyard, 9 trees, typhoon, 4 died, 5 more trees, left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did Haley perform first: growing 9 trees or losing 4 trees due to the typhoon?2. What is the result of subtracting the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees Haley grew?3. Who experienced the loss of trees after the typhoon? 4. In what location did Haley grow the trees?5. When did the typhoon occur in relation to Haley's tree-growing activity?6. How many trees did Haley have after she grew an additional 5 trees following the typhoon?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Haley began her tree-growing project by planting 9 trees. Unfortunately, a typhoon struck and resulted in the loss of 4 trees. To find out which operation she performed first, we consider the sequence of events. Since the growing occurred before the typhoon, Haley grew the trees first. After subtracting the trees that died due to the typhoon from the initial growth, the result would be:Initial growth: 9 treesLoss from typhoon: -4 treesResulting trees: 9 - 4 = 5 treesThe loss of trees after the typhoon affected Haley's count. The location where she grew the trees is not specified in the given information. However, the passage states that the typhoon occurred after the initial growth, so it was during or after the time she started growing trees.After the typhoon, Haley decided to add more trees to her collection. She grew an additional 5 trees, so to find out how many trees she had in total after this addition, we simply add the surviving trees to the new growth:Surviving trees: 5 (from the typhoon)Additional growth: +5 treesTotal trees after typhoon and growth: 5 + 5 = 10 treesIn summary, Haley grew 9 trees first, and then lost 4 to the typhoon, leaving her with 5 trees. After the typhoon, she added 5 more trees, resulting in a total of 10 trees. The exact location of the tree-growing and the timing relative to the typhoon are not provided in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is 10

Question:Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it. If 6 of those are ripe and the rest are unripe How many ripe apples did the tree have to begin with?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information given in the question.
- Rachel picked 2 ripe apples.
- Now the tree has 7 apples in total.
- 6 of those 7 apples are ripe.

Step 2: Determine what we need to find.
We want to know how many ripe apples the tree had initially before Rachel picked any.

Step 3: Analyze the information.
To find the initial number of ripe apples, we need to subtract the number of ripe apples that Rachel picked from the current total number of ripe apples on the tree.

Step 4: Calculate the initial number of ripe apples.
Current ripe apples = 6 (as given)
Apples picked by Rachel = 2 (also given)

Initial ripe apples = Current ripe apples - Apples picked by Rachel
Initial ripe apples = 6 - 2

Step 5: Perform the calculation.
Initial ripe apples = 4

So, the tree had 4 ripe apples to begin with.

Question:Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Adam, Jackie, 12 apples, 9 apples more, Adam and Jackie together, 8 more apples than Jackie, He..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) can be used to find out how many apples Jackie has if Adam has 8 more apples than she does?2. What equation represents the relationship between the number of apples Adam has, Jackie has, and the total they have together (12 apples)?3. Who has the greater number of apples, Adam or Jackie, and by how many apples?4. In what context is this problem set, i.e., are they sharing apples, dividing them, or comparing individual quantities?5. When does the problem take place, is it a static situation or does it involve a dynamic change in the number of apples?6. Why does "He" have 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined? Is there a specific reason or rule provided for this difference?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a simple arithmetic scenario, Jackie and Adam are comparing their apple collections. To determine how many apples Jackie has, we need to subtract 8 from the number of apples Adam possesses. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, if we let J represent the number of apples Jackie has and A represent Adam's, the equation would be A = J + 8. To find Jackie's apples, we can rearrange the equation to solve for J: J = A - 8. For instance, if Adam has 16 apples (let's assume this for illustration), then Jackie would have 16 - 8 = 8 apples.The relationship between the number of apples they both have and the total can be represented by the equation: J + A = 12. This means that together, Jackie and Adam possess a total of 12 apples. To find out how many apples each person has individually, we can substitute one person's quantity with the sum minus the other's. If we know Jackie has 8 and their combined total is 12, then Adam must have 12 - 8 = 4 apples.Comparing their quantities, Adam has more apples than Jackie, specifically by a difference of 8 - 4 = 4 apples. This problem seems to revolve around comparing individual quantities, rather than sharing or dividing them.The context suggests that the situation is static, as it doesn't indicate any change over time or transactions involving the apples. The reason "He" has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined could be a separate piece of information not provided here, but it implies that there is an additional person or perhaps a different context where this extra quantity comes into play. Without further details, it's impossible to determine the exact cause for this difference.

Question:The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the relationships between the animals' jumps.
- Grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog.
- Mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog.

Step 2: Use the information about the grasshopper's jump to find the frog's jump.
Since the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, we can represent the frog's jump as:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 19 inches

Given the grasshopper's jump is 39 inches, we can calculate the frog's jump:
Frog's jump = 39 inches - 19 inches

Why: Why is the difference in distance between the mouse and the grasshopper being calculated?7. How: How can we calculate the distance the mouse jumped, using the information provided about the frog's jump?8. How much: By how many inches did the mouse jump more than the grasshopper?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a curious comparison of leaps, the青蛙 and the grasshopper engaged in a lively jumping contest. A type of comparative analysis is employed to gauge their prowess, focusing on the distances they traversed. The frog, demonstrating its extraordinary agility, managed to cover a distance that was 29 inches greater than the grasshopper's leap. This impressive feat indicates that the frog jumped an astonishing 37 inches farther than the little hopping insect.The contest took place in a serene meadow, where nature's creatures often engage in playful contests to showcase their abilities. However, the exact time frame for this event is not specified; it could be a snapshot of a typical day or a hypothetical scenario meant to illustrate their contrasting jumps.Calculating the distance the mouse participated in becomes relevant when comparing it to the other two competitors. Since the frog jumped 37 inches more than the grasshopper, and we know the frog's jump, we can determine the mouse's jump by subtracting the frog's additional distance from the grasshopper's original jump. Assuming the grasshopper jumped x inches, the mouse's jump would be x - 37 inches.To find out the precise number, we would need the grasshopper's jump measurement. If, for instance, the grasshopper jumped 10 inches, the mouse would have jumped 10 - 37 = -27 inches. However, since a negative distance doesn't make sense in this context, it implies that the information provided isn't sufficient to accurately calculate the mouse's jump without the grasshopper's initial distance. If the grasshopper's jump was y inches, the mouse's jump would be y - 37 inches.

Question:The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:grasshopper, frog, mouse, jumping contest, 19 inches, 39 inches farther, 94 inches lesser, frog's jump distance.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the frog perform compared to the grasshopper's jump distance?2. What is the algebraic expression representing the frog's jump distance based on the grasshopper's 19 inches?3. Who participated in the jumping contest, and how does their jump relate to the others?4. Where does the comparison between the frog and the other animals' jumps take place?5. When does this jumping contest happen, and is it essential to know the timeframe for solving the problem?6. Why are we interested in determining the frog's jump distance, and what does it tell us about the contest?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a lively jumping contest held at the lush meadow every summer, the frog and the grasshopper showcased their extraordinary leaps. The grasshopper, known for its impressive abilities, managed to jump an impressive 19 inches. To determine the frog's operation in comparison to the grasshopper, we need to consider that the frog's jump was calculated to be half the distance of the grasshopper's. This implies that the frog performs a subtraction operation, as it jumps half the length, which can be represented algebraically as:\[ \text{Frog's jump distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Grasshopper's jump distance} \]\[ \text{Frog's jump distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times 19 \text{ inches} \]\[ \text{Frog's jump distance} = 9.5 \text{ inches} \]Both the frog and the grasshopper participated in the contest, with the frog's jump being significantly shorter than the grasshopper's. The comparison took place right at the center of the meadow, where all the animals gathered for the event. The timing of the contest is not crucial for solving the problem, as it merely sets the context for the action.Our interest in calculating the frog's jump distance lies in understanding the relative performance in the contest. It tells us that the frog's jump was not as long as the grasshopper's, highlighting a clear distinction in their leaping capabilities. This comparison provides insight into the physical prowess and agility displayed by these two contestants.

Therefore, the answer is 58

Question:2 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some more children got on the bus. Then there were 10 children altogether on the bus. How many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:children, riding on the bus, bus stop, more children got on, 10 children altogether, now, before the bus stop..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find out how many children were initially on the bus before the bus stop?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the number of children who got on the bus at the stop?3. Who or what is being measured in this situation - the number of children added or subtracted?4. Where does the comparison take place - before or after the bus stop?5. When does the comparison happen - during the ride or after all children have boarded?6. Why is it important to know the difference in the number of children? (Objective or purpose)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a bus starts its journey with an unknown number of children and stops at a point to pick up more, understanding the operations involved helps to determine the total count. To find out how many children were initially on the bus before the bus stop, we would need to perform an initial subtraction. Let's denote the number of children on the bus before the stop as \( B_0 \) and the number that got off during the ride as \( C_{off} \).The calculation for the initial number of children is:\[ B_0 = Total \; Children \; After \; Offloading \; - \; C_{off} \]Next, to determine the number of children who got on the bus at the stop, we would add the new passengers, represented by \( C_{on} \), to the current count:\[ C_{on} = Total \; Children \; After \; Pick-up \; - \; B_0 \]In this situation, the number of children added or subtracted is the key measurement. The comparison takes place both before and after the bus stop, but the focus is primarily after the events occur. The comparison happens during the ride when the offloading and picking up of children are noted.Knowing the difference in the number of children, which is \( C_{on} - C_{off} \), is important for several objectives. It could be crucial for tracking the bus's occupancy, ensuring seat reservations, calculating fare revenue, or maintaining records for safety and logistical purposes. By knowing the net change, one can accurately gauge the bus's capacity utilization and plan accordingly.

Therefore, the answer is 8

Question:Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework, 2 pages of reading homework and 96 more pages of biology homework. How many more pages of math homework than reading homework did she have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rachel, math homework, 9 pages, reading homework, 2 pages, biology homework, more pages, difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Rachel need to perform to find out how many pages of math homework she has compared to reading homework?2. What calculation does Rachel need to make to determine the difference between the number of pages for math and reading homework?3. Who is the subject involved in completing the different types of homework (math, reading, and biology)?4. In what subject is the extra 96 pages of homework assigned, and how does it relate to the math and reading homework?5. Given the timeframe for completing homework, is there a specific due date or context that affects the comparison of math and reading homework?6. Why is the difference between math and reading homework important to know for Rachel? (e.g., to manage her time, track progress, or understand workload distribution)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rachel needs to perform subtraction to find out how many pages of math homework she has compared to reading homework. To determine the difference, she would subtract the number of pages for reading homework from the number of pages for math homework. The subject involved in both math and reading homework is Rachel herself, as she is the one completing these assignments. The extra 96 pages are assigned in biology, which is separate from the math and reading homework. This information is relevant because it helps Rachel understand her overall workload distribution.To calculate the difference between math and reading homework, Rachel uses the formula: Math pages - Reading pages. Since there is no specific due date mentioned, the comparison is likely made to manage her time effectively, track her progress, and ensure a balanced allocation of study hours between subjects. Knowing this difference is crucial for Rachel to plan her study sessions efficiently and avoid procrastination.

Therefore, the answer is 7

Question:The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the given information.
- Grasshopper's jump: 19 inches
- Frog's jump is 10 inches farther than the grasshopper
- Mouse's jump is 20 inches farther than the frog

Step 2: Calculate the frog's jump.
Since the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, we add 10 inches to the grasshopper's jump:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 10 inches
Frog's jump = 19 inches + 10 inches

Step 3: Calculate the frog's jump.
Frog's jump = 29 inches

Step 4: Calculate the mouse's jump.
Now that we know the frog's jump, we add 20 inches to the frog's jump to find the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump + 20 inches
Mouse's jump = 29 inches + 20 inches

Step 5: Calculate the mouse's jump.
Mouse's jump = 49 inches

Step 6: Determine how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper.
To find the difference, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:
Difference = Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump
Difference = 49 inches - 19 inches

Step 7: Calculate the difference.
Difference = 30 inches

So, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 35 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds. How much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Marco, dad, strawberries, 35 pounds, Marco's strawberries, 13 pounds, his dad's strawberries, more weight..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the weight of his dad's strawberries?3. Who is the other person whose strawberries' weight needs to be compared?4. In what context did Marco and his dad go strawberry picking?5. When was the strawberry picking activity mentioned?6. Why is it necessary to find the difference in weight between Marco's and his dad's strawberries?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Marco and his dad decided to spend a fun weekend together, engaging in a recreational activity they both enjoyed - strawberry picking at a local farm. They arrived at the farm on a sunny Saturday morning, eager to harvest the ripest and juiciest strawberries. To calculate the total weight of the strawberries they collected, Marco's dad used a digital scale, which displayed the weight in grams.To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed, Marco needed to subtract the weight of his own basket from the combined weight measured by the scale. Let's denote his dad's strawberry weight as D (in grams) and Marco's as M (also in grams). The calculation would be:D = Scale reading - MOnce they had the individual weights, they compared their hauls to see who had picked more strawberries. This comparison wasn't just for bragging rights; it was also to determine if they had collected an equal amount, given the same time and effort spent picking. By finding the difference between their weights, they could gauge their productivity and perhaps even adjust their picking strategies for future visits.In summary, the passage describes a father-son bonding experience during strawberry picking, where the key calculations involved determining the weight of each picker's strawberries and comparing them to assess their respective harvests.

Therefore, the answer is 9

Question:Jake has 3 fewer peaches and 4 more apples than Steven. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches. How many more apples than peaches does Steven have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jake, peaches, fewer, apples, Steven, 19 apples, 15 peaches, more, apples, peaches.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Jake's apple count involve? (comparison, addition, or subtraction)2. What operation is used to find out how many peaches Jake has? (subtraction)3. How many peaches does Jake have? (15 - 3)4. Which entity is having a greater number of apples initially? (Steven or Jake)5. In what context are the apples and peaches being compared? (Jake's and Steven's possessions)6. Why is it necessary to compare the number of apples and peaches? (to find out the difference between them)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Jake's daily routine, his apple count involves a comparison operation as he tries to keep track of his progress. To determine the number of peaches he has, Jake uses subtraction, taking away 3 from his total, which equals 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. Initially, Jake had more apples than Steven, setting the stage for a comparison of their possessions. The apples and peaches were being compared in the context of their respective fruit counts, with the objective of finding out the difference between the two quantities, which would help understand whose stockpile was larger. This comparison was crucial to establish who might need to share or replenish their supply.

Therefore, the answer is 4

Question:There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left. How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Olivia's wallet, 3 dollars, 49 dollars, ATM, supermarket, 49 dollars left, more money collected, supermarket spent.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Olivia perform when she adds the money in her wallet to the amount collected at the ATM?2. What is the total amount of money Olivia had after collecting from the ATM?3. Who is the entity that spends money at the supermarket - Olivia or the supermarket itself?4. Where does Olivia spend the money, specifically at the ATM or the supermarket?5. When does Olivia find out how much money she has left after the supermarket visit?6. How much did Olivia initially spend at the supermarket if she had 49 dollars left after the transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Olivia engages in the mathematical operation of addition when she combines the money in her wallet with the amount she collects at the ATM. After an ATM withdrawal, she discovers that her total amount is $85. During her shopping trip to the supermarket, it is typically the spender, in this case, Olivia, who uses the money. She spends the money she had, which was a combination of the wallet's contents and the ATM cash. Upon returning from the supermarket, where she spent an undisclosed amount, Olivia calculates how much money she has left. If she had $49 left after the supermarket visit, we can determine the initial supermarket expenditure by subtracting the remaining amount from the total amount she had before the transaction. To find the initial supermarket expenditure, we can use the formula:Initial supermarket expenditure = Total amount before supermarket - Amount left after supermarketLet's denote the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket as \( S \). So,\( S = \$85 - \$49 \)Calculating this, we get:\( S = \$36 \)Therefore, Olivia initially spent $36 at the supermarket.

Therefore, the answer is 46

Question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 4 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information given in the question.
- Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds.
- Together, Marco and his dad's strawberries weighed 4 pounds.

Step 2: Determine what we need to find.
We need to find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's.

Step 3: Calculate the weight of his dad's strawberries.
Since we know the combined weight and Marco's weight, we can subtract Marco's weight from the total to find his dad's weight:
Weight of Dad's strawberries = Total weight - Marco's weight
Weight of Dad's strawberries = 4 pounds - 19 pounds

Step 4: Perform the calculation.
Weight of Dad's strawberries = -15 pounds (since 19 is subtracted from 4)

Step 5: Compare the weights to find the difference.
Now we need to find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, which means we take Marco's weight and add the negative weight of his dad's strawberries:
Difference = Marco's weight - Weight of Dad's strawberries
Difference = 19 pounds - (-15 pounds)

Step 6: Perform the final calculation.
Difference = 19 pounds + 15 pounds
Difference = 34 pounds

So, Marco's strawberries weighed 34 pounds more than his dad's.

To determine the frog's operation in comparison to the grasshopper, we need to consider that the frog's jump was calculated to be half the distance of the grasshopper's. This implies that the frog performs a subtraction operation, as it jumps half the length, which can be represented algebraically as:\[ \text{Frog's jump distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Grasshopper's jump distance} \]\[ \text{Frog's jump distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times 19 \text{ inches} \]\[ \text{Frog's jump distance} = 9.5 \text{ inches} \]Both the frog and the grasshopper participated in the contest, with the frog's jump being significantly shorter than the grasshopper's. The comparison took place right at the center of the meadow, where all the animals gathered for the event. The timing of the contest is not crucial for solving the problem, as it merely sets the context for the action.Our interest in calculating the frog's jump distance lies in understanding the relative performance in the contest. It tells us that the frog's jump was not as long as the grasshopper's, highlighting a clear distinction in their leaping capabilities. This comparison provides insight into the physical prowess and agility displayed by these two contestants.

Therefore, the answer is 58

Question:13 campers went rowing and 59 campers went hiking in the morning. 21 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing in all?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:campers, went rowing, morning, afternoon.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of campers who went rowing?2. What is the total number of campers that went rowing in the morning?3. Who are the individuals involved in this activity - campers who went rowing?4. Where did the morning rowing take place?5. When did the afternoon rowing occur?6. How many campers went rowing in both the morning and afternoon combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine the total number of campers who went rowing, we first need to add the number of campers from the morning session to those from the afternoon session. According to the records, there were 20 campers who participated in the morning rowing event at the serene lake located within our campsite. The afternoon rowing session saw an additional 15 campers joining in the fun.Calculating the combined total, we use the formula for addition: total = morning_campers + afternoon_campers. Therefore, total campers rowing = 20 (morning) + 15 (afternoon) = 35 campers. So, 35 campers went rowing in both the morning and afternoon combined.The individuals involved in this activity are the 20 campers from the morning group, which includes Jane, John, and Lisa, among others, and the 15 campers from the afternoon, such as Mike, Sarah, and Emily. The morning rowing took place at the lake while the afternoon rowing occurred later in the day, after lunch break.

Therefore, the answer is 34

Question:Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. Allan then bought 3 more balloons at the park. How many more balloons did Jake have than Allan in the park?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Allan, 2 balloons, Jake, 6 balloons, bought 3 more balloons, park, more balloons, had than Allan..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem require to compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's?2. What is the total number of balloons Allan had after buying more at the park?3. Who had more balloons initially before Allan bought any more?4. In what location did Allan buy the additional balloons?5. When did Allan buy the 3 more balloons at the park?6. Why is it necessary to find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To compare the initial number of balloons Allan had with Jake's, we needed to perform an arithmetic operation, specifically subtraction. Initially, Allan had 10 balloons, while Jake had 15. The problem required subtracting Allan's initial count from Jake's to determine the difference: 15 (Jake's balloons) - 10 (Allan's initial balloons) = 5 balloons.After buying more at the park, Allan increased his total by 3 balloons. To find the new total, we added the additional balloons to his initial count: 10 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 13 balloons.Comparing their counts again, it's clear that Jake had more balloons initially, as he had 15 balloons compared to Allan's 10.Allan bought the extra 3 balloons at the park, but the exact time is not specified in the information provided. However, we can infer that it happened after the comparison with Jake.The reason for finding out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan is to establish a numerical advantage, which could be relevant to a competition, a game, or simply to understand the relative quantity each person had at that point in time. This comparison helps in determining who might have had the larger supply of balloons.

Therefore, the answer is 1

Question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 35 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds. How much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Marco, dad, strawberries, 35 pounds, Marco's strawberries, 13 pounds, his dad's strawberries, more weight..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the weight of his dad's strawberries?3. Who is the other person whose strawberries' weight needs to be compared?4. In what context did Marco and his dad go strawberry picking?5. When was the strawberry picking activity mentioned?6. Why is it necessary to find the difference in weight between Marco's and his dad's strawberries?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Marco and his dad decided to spend a fun weekend together, engaging in a recreational activity they both enjoyed - strawberry picking at a local farm. They arrived at the farm on a sunny Saturday morning, eager to harvest the ripest and juiciest strawberries. To calculate the total weight of the strawberries they collected, Marco's dad used a digital scale, which displayed the weight in grams.To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed, Marco needed to subtract the weight of his own basket from the combined weight measured by the scale. Let's denote his dad's strawberry weight as D (in grams) and Marco's as M (also in grams). The calculation would be:D = Scale reading - MOnce they had the individual weights, they compared their hauls to see who had picked more strawberries. This comparison wasn't just for bragging rights; it was also to determine if they had collected an equal amount, given the same time and effort spent picking. By finding the difference between their weights, they could gauge their productivity and perhaps even adjust their picking strategies for future visits.In summary, the passage describes a father-son bonding experience during strawberry picking, where the key calculations involved determining the weight of each picker's strawberries and comparing them to assess their respective harvests.

Therefore, the answer is 9

Question:Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Adam, Jackie, 12 apples, 9 apples more, Adam and Jackie together, 8 more apples than Jackie, He..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) can be used to find out how many apples Jackie has if Adam has 8 more apples than she does?2. What equation represents the relationship between the number of apples Adam has, Jackie has, and the total they have together (12 apples)?3. Who has the greater number of apples, Adam or Jackie, and by how many apples?4. In what context is this problem set, i.e., are they sharing apples, dividing them, or comparing individual quantities?5. When does the problem take place, is it a static situation or does it involve a dynamic change in the number of apples?6. Why does "He" have 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined? Is there a specific reason or rule provided for this difference?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a simple arithmetic scenario, Jackie and Adam are comparing their apple collections. To determine how many apples Jackie has, we need to subtract 8 from the number of apples Adam possesses. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, if we let J represent the number of apples Jackie has and A represent Adam's, the equation would be A = J + 8. To find Jackie's apples, we can rearrange the equation to solve for J: J = A - 8. For instance, if Adam has 16 apples (let's assume this for illustration), then Jackie would have 16 - 8 = 8 apples.The relationship between the number of apples they both have and the total can be represented by the equation: J + A = 12. This means that together, Jackie and Adam possess a total of 12 apples. To find out how many apples each person has individually, we can substitute one person's quantity with the sum minus the other's. If we know Jackie has 8 and their combined total is 12, then Adam must have 12 - 8 = 4 apples.Comparing their quantities, Adam has more apples than Jackie, specifically by a difference of 8 - 4 = 4 apples. This problem seems to revolve around comparing individual quantities, rather than sharing or dividing them.The context suggests that the situation is static, as it doesn't indicate any change over time or transactions involving the apples. The reason "He" has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie combined could be a separate piece of information not provided here, but it implies that there is an additional person or perhaps a different context where this extra quantity comes into play. Without further details, it's impossible to determine the exact cause for this difference.

Therefore, the answer is 21

Question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information given in the question.
- Total weight of strawberries collected: 36 pounds
- Weight of strawberries with Marco's after loss: 12 pounds
- Weight lost by dad on the way back: 8 pounds

Step 2: Determine the original weight of Marco's strawberries.
Since Marco's strawberries now weigh 12 pounds after his dad lost some, we can add the weight lost to find out how much they originally weighed together.

Original weight of Marco's strawberries + Weight lost by dad = Original total weight
12 pounds + 8 pounds = 20 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the original weight of his dad's strawberries.
To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed originally, we subtract Marco's original weight from the total weight collected.

Total weight collected - Original weight of Marco's strawberries = Original weight of dad's strawberries
36 pounds - 20 pounds = 16 pounds

Step 4: Account for the weight loss by his dad.
Now, since his dad lost 8 pounds, we subtract that from the original weight to find out the current weight.

Original weight of dad's strawberries - Weight lost by dad = Dad's strawberries now
16 pounds - 8 pounds = 8 pounds

So, his dad's strawberries now weigh 8 pounds.

Question:The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:grasshopper, frog, mouse, jumping contest, 14 inches, 16 inches lesser, 37 inches farther, farther than the grasshopper, how much farther.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of comparison is being made between the distances jumped by the frog and the grasshopper?2. What: How much did the frog jump, considering the additional distance it covered compared to the grasshopper?3. Who: Which animal is mentioned to have jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper?4. Where: In what context does this jumping contest take place?5. When: Is there a specific time frame given for the jumping contest or is it a hypothetical scenario?6. Why: Why is the difference in distance between the mouse and the grasshopper being calculated?7. How: How can we calculate the distance the mouse jumped, using the information provided about the frog's jump?8. How much: By how many inches did the mouse jump more than the grasshopper?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a curious comparison of leaps, the青蛙 and the grasshopper engaged in a lively jumping contest. A type of comparative analysis is employed to gauge their prowess, focusing on the distances they traversed. The frog, demonstrating its extraordinary agility, managed to cover a distance that was 29 inches greater than the grasshopper's leap. This impressive feat indicates that the frog jumped an astonishing 37 inches farther than the little hopping insect.The contest took place in a serene meadow, where nature's creatures often engage in playful contests to showcase their abilities. However, the exact time frame for this event is not specified; it could be a snapshot of a typical day or a hypothetical scenario meant to illustrate their contrasting jumps.Calculating the distance the mouse participated in becomes relevant when comparing it to the other two competitors. Since the frog jumped 37 inches more than the grasshopper, and we know the frog's jump, we can determine the mouse's jump by subtracting the frog's additional distance from the grasshopper's original jump. Assuming the grasshopper jumped x inches, the mouse's jump would be x - 37 inches.To find out the precise number, we would need the grasshopper's jump measurement. If, for instance, the grasshopper jumped 10 inches, the mouse would have jumped 10 - 37 = -27 inches. However, since a negative distance doesn't make sense in this context, it implies that the information provided isn't sufficient to accurately calculate the mouse's jump without the grasshopper's initial distance. If the grasshopper's jump was y inches, the mouse's jump would be y - 37 inches.

Therefore, the answer is 21

Question:Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Zachary, push-ups, 15, David, 39 more, John, 9 push-ups less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to compare the number of push-ups Zachary did with David's?2. What calculation does David perform on Zachary's number of push-ups to find his own count?3. Who did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, and how many push-ups did David do in total?4. In what context did John perform push-ups, and how many push-ups did he do compared to Zachary?5. When did this situation occur - was it a one-time event or part of a routine?6. Why is it important to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John? (Objective or purpose)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a friendly competition to maintain fitness, Zachary and David engaged in a push-up challenge. To compare their progress, they used the comparison operator "more than" or "greater than" (>). Zachary had completed 75 push-ups, while David wanted to know his own count relative to Zachary's. To find out how many push-ups he needed to do, David subtracted Zachary's count from his target, which would be represented by the formula: David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + additional push-ups.David calculated that he needed to do 100 push-ups in total, so he performed the calculation: 100 - 75 = 25 push-ups more than Zachary. It turned out that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, reaching a total of 114 push-ups.John, another participant, joined the group for a workout session. He performed push-ups as part of a daily routine, aiming to surpass Zachary. John managed to do 46 push-ups that day. Comparing John's count to Zachary's, we can see that Zachary did 75 - 46 = 29 more push-ups than John.This push-up competition was not a one-time event but rather an ongoing effort to encourage healthy competition and motivate each other in their fitness journey. The objective of tracking how many more push-ups each person did was to gauge personal improvement, set new goals, and foster a sense of accomplishment within the group.

Therefore, the answer is 30

Question:Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Helen, hippo, friends, Thanksgiving, Helen's house, chocolate chip cookies, 197 cookies (yesterday), 75 cookies (today), raisin cookies, 46 cookies (yesterday), 66 cookies (today).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today?2. What is the total number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday?3. Who baked the chocolate chip cookies - Helen or her friends?4. Where did Helen bake the cookies - at her house or elsewhere?5. When did the baking take place - specifically, what day is being referred to when discussing yesterday's baking?6. How many fewer raisin cookies did Helen bake today compared to yesterday?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Helen decided to compare the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked yesterday and today using the subtraction operation. Yesterday, she baked an impressive total of 24 chocolate chip cookies, a result of her culinary prowess. Contrasting that, today she baked 18 cookies, which indicates a decrease in quantity. The difference between the two days' counts shows that Helen baked 24 (yesterday's count) minus 18 (today's count), resulting in 6 fewer raisin cookies baked today compared to yesterday. It's worth noting that all the cookie baking took place at Helen's cozy house, and this activity occurred on a Saturday, as the context suggests a weekend baking session with her friends assisting her.

Therefore, the answer is 131

Question:The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information given in the question.
- Grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
- Grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog.
- Mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

Step 2: Determine the frog's jump distance.
Since the grasshopper jumped 25 inches more than the frog, we can find the frog's jump by subtracting 25 inches from the grasshopper's jump:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 25 inches
Frog's jump = 21 inches - 25 inches
Frog's jump = -4 inches (This is not possible, as a negative distance doesn't make sense in this context. There seems to be an error in the problem statement.)

Step 3: Reevaluate the problem based on the given information.
It appears that the problem might be misstated or incomplete, as the frog's jump cannot be negative. Let's assume there was a mistake in the problem and the frog actually jumped 21 inches (the same as the grasshopper) or some other positive value. However, without this clarification, we cannot accurately solve the problem as given.

If the frog also jumped 21 inches (like the grasshopper), then the mouse's jump would be:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 16 inches
Mouse's jump = 21 inches - 16 inches
Mouse's jump = 5 inches

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the grasshopper's and the mouse's jumps.
Difference = Grasshopper's jump - Mouse's jump
Difference = 21 inches - 5 inches
Difference = 16 inches

However, if the frog jumped 21 inches and the problem is correct, the grasshopper would have jumped exactly the same distance as the mouse, and there would be no difference.

Without a clear statement about the frog's jump, we cannot provide a definitive answer. If you can confirm the frog's jump, we can proceed with the calculation.

Question:Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Mary, baking a cake, recipe, 6 cups of sugar, 9 cups of flour, 2 cups of flour, more cups of flour, cups of sugar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Mary need to perform to find out how many more cups of flour she needs?2. What calculation does Mary need to do with the given amounts of sugar (6 cups) and flour (2 cups already added)?3. Who is responsible for ensuring the correct ratio of sugar to flour in the cake recipe?4. Where does this situation take place - in Mary's kitchen or a different location?5. When does Mary need to complete this task - before mixing other ingredients or after baking?6. Why is it important for Mary to know the difference in cups of flour and sugar in the recipe?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Mary found herself in her cozy kitchen, preparing to bake a cake from a family recipe. To ensure the perfect balance of flavors, the recipe called for a precise ratio of sugar to flour, which was 3 cups of sugar for every 4 cups of flour. With 2 cups of flour already added, she needed to determine how much more flour she should add. To find out, she would subtract the amount she had from the required ratio. First, she calculated the remaining flour needed by subtracting the 2 cups from the total required amount (4 cups). So, 4 cups - 2 cups = 2 cups of flour were still needed. However, since the ratio also included sugar, Mary knew she needed to account for that as well. She multiplied the additional flour by the sugar-to-flour ratio: 2 cups * (3 cups sugar / 4 cups flour) = 1.5 cups of sugar.Now, to find the total sugar content, she added the 6 cups she had to the 1.5 cups required: 6 cups + 1.5 cups = 7.5 cups of sugar in total. Ensuring the correct ratio was crucial for the cake's texture and taste, and this task fell on Mary herself.The situation took place right in Mary's kitchen, where she carefully measured the ingredients before mixing them with other components like eggs and milk. It was essential to complete this step before incorporating the dry ingredients into the batter, as it would affect the final product's consistency.Knowing the difference in cups of flour and sugar was vital because any deviation from the recipe could lead to an unbalanced cake, affecting its rise and overall quality. Mary made the necessary calculations to maintain the perfect ratio, ensuring a delicious treat for her family and friends.

Therefore, the answer is 1

Where does this problem take place - is it in a school, home, or another setting?5. When does Rachel complete her homework - is there a specific deadline or time frame mentioned?6. Why is the difference in pages significant? Is it part of a larger assignment or a comparison between subjects?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: In a typical school setting, Rachel faces the task of managing her homework assignments. To determine the total pages of reading homework she needs to complete, she first needs to subtract the number of pages dedicated to math from the combined total of both subjects. Unfortunately, the exact numbers for math and reading homework are not provided in the question, but if we denote the math homework as M pages and the reading homework as R pages, the calculation would be R = (Total Homework Pages) - M.The relationship between the math and reading homework lies in their combined workload, suggesting they are part of a larger homework assignment for Rachel. As the subject, Rachel is responsible for completing both sets of exercises, which likely have different deadlines or expectations.This problem takes place in a general context, most likely at home, where students often complete their homework after school hours. The specific deadline or time frame for when Rachel completes her homework is not mentioned, but it is assumed to be within her regular study routine.The significance of the difference in pages could be due to the varying difficulty levels or the teacher's intention to balance the workload. It might indicate that the reading homework is more extensive or that it forms a larger portion of the overall points or grade. Without further context, we can only assume that understanding the difference is crucial for Rachel to manage her time effectively and prioritize her studies.

Therefore, the answer is 3

Question:Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 85 raisin cookies and 403 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Helen, hippo, friends, Thanksgiving, Helen's house, raisin cookies, 144 chocolate chip cookies, 397 raisin cookies, 85 raisin cookies, 403 chocolate chip cookies..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which type of cookies did Helen bake more of, chocolate chip or raisin, before this morning?2. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake in total yesterday?3. How many raisin cookies did Helen bake this morning?4. In what event or celebration were the cookies prepared - Thanksgiving or some other occasion?5. Where was the baking activity taking place - at Helen's house or elsewhere?6. Why was Helen baking so many cookies - for a gathering, personal consumption, or gift-giving?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Helen, an avid baker, had been preparing cookies for an upcoming event. Before this morning, she had baked a total of 100 cookies, with an equal number of chocolate chip and raisin varieties. Yesterday, she focused on raisin cookies, baking half of her total cookie count. To find out how many raisin cookies she made yesterday, we can divide the total number of cookies by 2:\( \frac{100 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 50 \text{ raisin cookies} \)This morning, she baked another batch, which was also a third of her total cookie count at that point. Since she had already baked 50 raisin cookies, this would be:\( \frac{100 \text{ cookies} - 50 \text{ (yesterday's raisin cookies)}}{3} \)\( \frac{50 \text{ cookies}}{3} \approx 16.67 \)Rounded to the nearest whole number, she baked approximately 17 raisin cookies this morning.The cookies were being prepared for Thanksgiving, a time when families gather to share delicious treats. The baking activity took place at Helen's cozy house, where she has all the necessary ingredients and equipment. Helen was baking so many cookies not just for personal consumption but also as gifts for friends and neighbors, to spread the holiday cheer.

Therefore, the answer is 482

- Total flour required: 14 cups
- Flour already added: 5 cups
- Remaining flour needed: 14 - 5 = 9 cups

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the remaining flour and sugar:
- Sugar required: 6 cups
- Difference: Remaining flour - Sugar required = 9 cups - 6 cups

Step 4: Perform the subtraction:
- Difference: 9 - 6 = 3 cups

So, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than the 6 cups of sugar called for in the recipe.

Question:Baker sold 44 cakes. If he had made 48 cakes initially How many cakes would baker still have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Baker, cakes, 44 cakes, initially, 48 cakes, remaining cakes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many cakes Baker would have left after selling some?2. What is the mathematical expression that represents the remaining cakes after Baker sells 44 from his initial 48?3. Who is the subject of the calculation, and what is their initial quantity of cakes?4. In what context does the problem take place (a bakery, a store, etc.)?5. When does the problem occur - is it immediately after baking or during a specific period?6. Why is finding the remaining cakes important in this situation? Could it be related to inventory management or customer satisfaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a bakery scenario, Baker starts with an initial stock of 48 delicious cakes. To determine how many cakes he would have left after selling some, the appropriate mathematical operation is subtraction. The expression that represents the remaining cakes after selling 44 would be: Initial Cakes - Cakes Sold = Remaining Cakes48 - 44 = 4 cakesHere, the subject of the calculation is Baker, and his initial quantity of cakes is 48. This problem takes place in a bakery setting, where inventory management is crucial. The calculation occurs immediately after the sales transaction, ensuring that Baker knows the stock available for future customers or for record-keeping purposes. Knowing the remaining cakes is important because it helps maintain an accurate count for replenishment, customer satisfaction, and overall business planning.

Therefore, the answer is 4

Question:Frank had 33 pieces of candy. He lost 24 of them. If he put the remaining pieces into bags with 9 pieces in each bag How many bags would he have?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Frank, 33 pieces of candy, lost 24, remaining pieces, bags, 9 pieces in each bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Frank perform to find out how many pieces of candy are left after losing some?2. What mathematical operation should be used to calculate the number of remaining pieces of candy after the loss?3. Who is the subject involved in distributing the remaining candy into bags?4. Where would this situation take place - at Frank's home, a friend's house, or elsewhere?5. When does Frank need to complete this task - immediately after losing the candy, before a party, or at a specific time?6. Why is it important to divide the remaining pieces into bags with 9 pieces each? (Could be for equal sharing or a specific event)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Frank was at his friend's house when he accidentally dropped his bag of candy, losing some pieces in the process. To find out how many pieces were left, he subtracted the lost candies from the initial amount. After the calculation, he realized that there were 36 pieces remaining. With a party scheduled later that day, Frank knew he needed to complete the task before then, dividing the remaining pieces equally among his friends.Realizing that dividing the candy into bags of 9 would ensure everyone got an equal share, he decided to use the division formula: total pieces / number of bags = pieces per bag. So, 36 pieces divided by 9 resulted in 4 bags of candy. This thoughtful preparation ensured a fair distribution and prevented any disputes among his friends at the party.

Therefore, the answer is 1

Question:Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Paul, box of crayons, birthday, lost or given away, 551 crayons, 177 crayons left..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should Paul perform to find out how many crayons he initially had before losing or giving away any?2. What mathematical operation can be used to calculate the initial number of crayons Paul had if we know the number he lost or gave away and the ones he had left?3. Who are the parties involved in the situation where Paul lost or gave away crayons - Paul himself or someone else?4. Where did this situation occur - at home, school, or somewhere else?5. When did Paul receive the box of crayons, and when did he lose or give them away?6. Why is it important to determine the initial number of crayons? Could it be related to a ratio or understanding the distribution?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Paul found himself in a situation where he wanted to recall the number of crayons he initially had before any losses or gifts occurred. To solve this, he needed to perform an addition operation. If he knew the exact number of crayons he had lost or given away, say it was 15, and the remaining count was 30, he could use the formula for subtraction to find the initial quantity:Initial Number = Remaining Crayons + Lost or Given Away CrayonsIn this case, the calculation would be:Initial Number = 30 (crayons left) + 15 (lost or given away)Adding these together gives us:Initial Number = 45 crayonsThe parties involved in this situation were Paul himself, as he was both the one who received the box of crayons and experienced the loss or giveaway. This incident took place at home, likely during a time when he was engaged in creative activities with his children or simply organizing his belongings.Determining the initial number of crayons was crucial for Paul because it allowed him to understand the distribution or ratio of crayons before and after the loss or donation. This could be significant if he needed to replenish his supply based on a specific ratio or if he wanted to account for the change in his art supplies. By knowing the starting point, Paul could make informed decisions about purchasing new crayons or redistributing what he still had.

Therefore, the answer is 728
