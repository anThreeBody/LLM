Question:29 campers went rowing and 66 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
In the morning, 29 campers went rowing.

In the afternoon, 26 campers went rowing.

To find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon, we subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number who went in the morning:

\( 29 (morning) - 26 (afternoon) = 3 \)

So, 3 more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the evening from the number who went in the morning.

Morning campers = 53
Evening campers = 49

Difference = Morning campers - Evening campers
Difference = 53 - 49

Now let's do the calculation.
Difference = 4

So, 4 more campers went rowing in the morning than in the evening.

Question:2 birds were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Initially, there are 2 birds on the fence. 

5 more birds come, so we add those to the initial number:
2 (initial) + 5 (more birds) = 7 birds.

4 more storks also come, but we don't have a starting number for storks, so let's assume there were 0 storks at first. Now there are:
0 (initial storks) + 4 (more storks) = 4 storks.

Now, to find out how many more birds than storks are there, we subtract the number of storks from the number of birds:
7 birds - 4 storks = 3 more birds than storks.

So, there are 3 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.

Question:There were 73 parents, 724 pupils and 744 teachers in the program. How many people were present in the program?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the total number of people present in the program, we need to add the number of parents, pupils, and teachers together.

Total number of people = Number of parents + Number of pupils + Number of teachers

Given:
Number of parents = 73
Number of pupils = 724
Number of teachers = 744

Now, let's add them up:

Total number of people = 73 + 724 + 744

Calculating the sum:

Total number of people = 1541

Question:The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many students there are in total at the school. Since there are 58 students per classroom and 87 classrooms, we multiply the number of classrooms by the number of students per classroom:

Total students = Number of classrooms * Students per classroom
Total students = 87 classrooms * 58 students/classroom

Now, let's calculate that:

Total students = 4986 students

Next, we need to determine how many buses are needed to transport all these students, given that each bus can hold 2 students:

Number of buses = Total students / Students per bus
Number of buses = 4986 students / 2 students/bus

Now, let's do the division:

Number of buses = 2493 buses (since you can't have a fraction of a bus, we round up because even one more student would require an additional bus)

So, the school needs 2493 buses. However, since you can't have a fraction of a bus, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

Answer: 2494 buses are needed to take the trip.

Question:22 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 2 children altogether on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we know that there were initially 22 children on the bus. Then, 40 children got on the bus at the bus stop.

Let's denote the number of children who got off the bus as \( x \).

After the children got on and some got off, the total number of children on the bus became 2. So we can write the equation:

\( 22 + 40 - x = 2 \)

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\( 62 - x = 2 \)

Subtract 62 from both sides:

\( -x = 2 - 62 \)

\( -x = -60 \)

Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):

\( x = 60 \)

So, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

60.

Question:Some campers went rowing in the morning while 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. If a total of 60 campers went rowing that day How many campers went rowing in the morning?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let's denote the number of campers who went rowing in the morning as \( M \) and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon as \( A \).

According to the problem, we have:
1. \( M \) campers went rowing in the morning.
2. \( A = 7 \) campers went rowing in the afternoon.
3. The total number of campers who went rowing is 60.

So, we can write the equation as:
\( M + A = 60 \)

Now, we substitute the value of \( A \) into the equation:
\( M + 7 = 60 \)

To find \( M \), we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\( M = 60 - 7 \)
\( M = 53 \)

Therefore, 53 campers went rowing in the morning.

First, we need to determine the total number of bottle caps Danny had after finding the new ones and before throwing away the old ones. We know that he now has 67 bottle caps.

According to the information given, he found 58 new ones, so we add those to the 67 he currently has:

67 (current) + 58 (new found) = 125 bottle caps

Now, since he threw away 60 old ones, we subtract those from the total:

125 (total after finding) - 60 (thrown away) = 65 bottle caps

Question:He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 76 sacks per day and discard 64 of them. How many oranges do they harvest per day if each sack contains 50 oranges?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the total number of oranges harvested before discarding any. If they harvest 76 sacks per day and each sack contains 50 oranges, we multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges per sack:

Total oranges harvested = Number of sacks * Oranges per sack
Total oranges harvested = 76 sacks * 50 oranges/sack

After calculating that, we subtract the 64 sacks that are discarded:

Oranges after discarding = Total oranges harvested - Discarded sacks * Oranges per sack
Oranges after discarding = (76 * 50) - 64 * 50

Now let's do the math.

Total oranges harvested = 76 * 50 = 3800 oranges
Oranges after discarding = 3800 - 64 * 50

Let's compute this.
Answer: 3800 - 64 * 50 = 3800 - 3200 = 600 oranges

So, they harvest 600 oranges per day after discarding the ones in the 64 sacks.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his total rent expenses.

Total earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Total rent expenses = Weekly rent * Number of weeks

Let's do the math:

Total earnings = $491/week * 1181 weeks
Total rent expenses = $216/week * 1181 weeks

Now, let's calculate these amounts:

Total earnings = $491 * 1181
Total rent expenses = $216 * 1181

After calculating these, we'll subtract the total rent expenses from the total earnings to find out how much money Lewis will have left.

Let's do the calculations:

Total earnings = $577,071
Total rent expenses = $256,336

Money left after paying rent = Total earnings - Total rent expenses
Money left = $577,071 - $256,336

Now, let's subtract:

Money left = $320,735

So, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $320,735.

If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many students participated in suggesting new food items, we can subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of students.

Total students = 450 (mashed potatoes) + 38 (bacon) + Rest (students who didn't participate)

First, add the students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon:

450 (mashed potatoes) + 38 (bacon) = 488 students

Now, since this is the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon, the rest who didn't participate is the difference between the total students and the sum:

Total students - 488 = Rest

Let's calculate that:

660 (total choices) - 488 = Rest

Rest = 172 students

So, 172 students participated in suggesting new food items.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Danny initially found 65 wrappers and 5 bottle caps at the park. After adding these to his existing collection, we have:

- Park find: Wrappers = 65
- Park find: Bottle caps = 5

Now, we know he has 31 bottle caps in his collection after adding the ones from the park. So, the total number of bottle caps he had before the park find is:

Total bottle caps = Park find + Collection before = 5 (from the park) + 31 (in his collection) = 36 bottle caps

He also has 9 wrappers in his collection after adding the ones from the park, so the total number of wrappers he had before the park find is:

Total wrappers = Park find + Collection before = 65 (from the park) + 9 (in his collection) = 74 wrappers

To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps he found at the park, we subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers:

Difference = Total wrappers (from the park) - Total bottle caps (from the park)
Difference = 65 (wrappers) - 5 (bottle caps) = 60

So, Danny found 60 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out the total number of sacks of oranges harvested after 26 days, we need to add the number of ripe oranges harvested each day to the number of unripe oranges harvested each day and then multiply by the number of days.

Number of ripe oranges per day = 28
Number of unripe oranges per day = 52
Number of days = 26

Total ripe oranges in 26 days = 28 * 26
Total unripe oranges in 26 days = 52 * 26

Question:The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 23 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they made $ 230 by selling t-shirts. How many t-shirts did they sell?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many t-shirts the Razorback t-shirt shop sold during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, we can divide the total amount made by the profit per t-shirt. 

Total amount made = $230
Profit per t-shirt = $23

Number of t-shirts sold = Total amount made / Profit per t-shirt
Number of t-shirts sold = $230 / $23

Now let's do the calculation:

Number of t-shirts sold = 10

So, they sold 10 t-shirts.

Question:For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks. If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we calculate the total number of nails needed for the large planks. Since there are 12 large planks and each requires 15 nails:

Nails for large planks = Number of large planks × Nails per large plank
Nails for large planks = 12 × 15

Next, we calculate the total number of nails needed for the small planks. There are 10 small planks and each requires 5 nails:

Nails for small planks = Number of small planks × Nails per small plank
Nails for small planks = 10 × 5

Now, we add the nails for both types of planks to find the total nails needed:

Total nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for small planks

Let's do the math:

Nails for large planks = 12 * 15 = 180
Nails for small planks = 10 * 5 = 50
Total nails = 180 + 50 = 230

So, John needs 230 nails for the house walls.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
You have read 13 books and watched 63 movies from the 'Crazy Silly School' series. To find out how many more movies there are than books, we subtract the number of books you've read from the total number of movies.

Total movies = 17
Books read = 13

Movies more than books = Total movies - Books read
Movies more than books = 17 - 13

Now let's calculate the difference.

Jerry initially had 3 action figures. He added 4 more, so the total would be:

Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 99 candy bars at $3 each. 

Total cost = Number of candy bars * Cost per candy bar
Total cost = 99 * $3

Let's do the math:

Total cost = 99 * 3 = $297

Now, we subtract this total cost from the initial amount Dan had to find out how much money is left.

Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $4 - $297

Money left = -$293

Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Lucy bought a total of 27 packs of groceries, which includes both cookies and cakes. We know she bought 23 packs of cookies. To find out how many packs of cake she bought, we subtract the number of cookie packs from the total number of grocery packs:

Total grocery packs = Packs of cookies + Packs of cake
27 packs = 23 packs (cookies) + Packs of cake

Now, let's do the subtraction:

Packs of cake = Total grocery packs - Packs of cookies

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many packs of groceries Lucy bought in all, we need to determine the total cost of the cookies and cakes and then add that to the change she had left.

1. We know she bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cake.
2. The number of packs is not enough information to calculate the total cost directly, as we don't have the price per pack.
3. However, since she had 56 units of change remaining, we can assume that this is the total cost of the groceries in some currency or value system, with each pack having a whole number of units of currency.

Without knowing the price per pack, we cannot provide an exact number for the total number of packs. If you could provide the price of one pack (for either cookies or cakes), we could solve the problem. Otherwise, the answer would be "unknown based on the given information."

Question:You had 26 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total How many cookies does each bag have?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many cookies are in each bag, we first need to determine the total number of cookies from the information given.

We know that there are:
- 15 candies
- 52 cookies in total

Since the number of cookies is the total, we can subtract the number of candies from the total to get the number of cookies that are just from the cookies in the bags.

Total cookies from bags = Total cookies - Number of candies
Total cookies from bags = 52 - 15

Now, we'll calculate this:

Total cookies from bags = 37

There are 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, so to find out how many cookies each bag has, we divide the total number of cookies from the bags by the number of bags:

Cookies per bag = Total cookies from bags / Number of bags
Cookies per bag = 37 / 26

Let's do the division:

Cookies per bag ≈ 1.423 (approximately)

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a cookie, we round down to the nearest whole number because cookies cannot be split.

So, each bag has approximately 1 cookie. However, since the question asks for the exact number, and we don't have any other information to account for the remaining cookies, we should assume that each bag has exactly 1 cookie if the cookies were evenly distributed.

Answer: Each bag has 1 cookie.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Paul initially had 589 crayons. He gave away 571 crayons and lost 161 crayons.

To find out how many more crayons he gave away than he lost, we subtract the number of crayons he lost from the number he gave away:

571 (given away) - 161 (lost) = 410

Question:Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Since Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 16 peaches, Jake has:

\( 16 - 9 = 7 \) peaches.

Jake also has 18 more peaches than Jill, so Jill has:

\( 7 - 18 = -11 \) peaches (which doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of peaches).

However, since the question asks for how many more peaches Steven has than Jill, we need to adjust our calculation for Jill's actual count, which should be 0 (because it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches).

So, Jill has 0 peaches, and Steven has 16 peaches. The difference is:

\( 16 - 0 = 16 \)

Steven has 16 more peaches than Jill.

Question:There are 11 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. How many peaches are in the baskets altogether?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Each basket contains a total of red and green peaches. We can calculate the total number of peaches in one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

For one basket:
Red peaches = 10
Green peaches = 18
Total peaches in one basket = Red + Green

Total for all baskets:
Total peaches = Total in one basket * Number of baskets
Total peaches = (10 + 18) * 11

Now, let's do the math.
Total peaches = 28 * 11
Total peaches = 308

So, there are 308 peaches in the baskets altogether.

Question:Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together. If he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g Total how many grams of wax do the feathers require?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how much wax the feathers require, we need to subtract the amount of wax he already has from the total amount he needs. 

Total wax needed = 17 g
Wax he has = 557 g

Wax required for feathers = Total wax needed - Wax he has
Wax required for feathers = 17 g - 557 g

Now let's calculate the difference:

Wax required for feathers = -540 g

However, it doesn't make sense to have a negative amount of wax, as you can't use a negative quantity. It seems there might be an error in the question or some context missing. If the 557 g is meant to be the excess wax after using some for the feathers, then he would have exactly what he needs and wouldn't require any more. If the 557 g is the total wax supply, then he has enough for the 17 g and would have 540 g left over.

If you meant to ask how much wax he has left after using 17 g for the feathers, the calculation would be:

Wax left = Wax he has - Wax used for feathers
Wax left = 557 g - 17 g

Let's do that calculation:

Wax left = 540 g

So, if the 557 g is the total supply, he would have 540 g of wax remaining after using 17 g for the feathers. Please clarify the question if this is not what you were asking.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
540 g (if the 557 g is the total supply) or 0 g (if the 557 g is the excess wax after using some for the feathers).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the length of Jesse's room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area of the carpet = 14 square feet
- Width of the room = 7 feet

We need to solve for the length (L), so we rearrange the formula:

\[ \text{Length} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Width}} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ L = \frac{14 \text{ ft}^2}{7 \text{ ft}} \]

Now, let's calculate the length:

\[ L = 2 \text{ ft} \]

So, the length of Jesse's room is 2 feet.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so if we subtract that distance from the grasshopper's jump, we can find out how far the frog jumped.

Grasshopper's jump = 39 inches
Additional jump for frog = 19 inches

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - Additional jump
Frog's jump = 39 inches - 19 inches
Frog's jump = 20 inches

Now, the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so we subtract that from the frog's jump to find out the mouse's jump.

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 12 inches
Mouse's jump = 20 inches - 12 inches
Mouse's jump = 8 inches

So, the mouse jumped 8 inches.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we know that Marco and his dad originally picked 36 pounds of strawberries combined. After losing 8 pounds, Marco had 12 pounds left.

To find out how much Marco's strawberries weighed before the loss, we add the 8 pounds back to what he has now:

Marco's strawberries after loss + Loss = Original weight of Marco's strawberries
12 pounds + 8 pounds = 20 pounds

Since Marco's original weight was 20 pounds and they collected a total of 36 pounds, we can find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed initially by subtracting Marco's from the total:

Total weight - Marco's initial weight = Dad's initial weight
36 pounds - 20 pounds = 16 pounds

Now, since 16 pounds is the initial weight of his dad's strawberries before the loss, and they lost 8 pounds, we subtract that from the initial weight to find out how much they weigh now:

Dad's initial weight - Loss = Dad's strawberries now
16 pounds - 8 pounds = 8 pounds

So, Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 8 pounds.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. If we denote the frog's jump as \( F \), then the grasshopper's jump is \( F + 25 \) inches.

According to the problem, the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump is \( F - 16 \) inches.

To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we subtract the mouse's jump from the grasshopper's jump:

Grasshopper's jump - Mouse's jump = \( (F + 25) - (F - 16) \)

Now let's simplify this expression:

\( F + 25 - F + 16 \)
\( = 25 + 16 \)
\( = 41 \) inches

So, the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
41 inches.

Question:Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. Mary has already added 5 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total required:

14 cups (total flour) - 5 cups (flour used) = 9 cups (more flour needed)

Now, since the question asks for the difference between the remaining flour and sugar, we don't need to consider the sugar because it's not part of the calculation for the additional flour needed. So, the answer is:

9 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.

Question:Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 11 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and Mary has already added 11 cups. So, she still needs:

14 cups (total flour) - 11 cups (flour used) = 3 cups of flour left to add.

The recipe also calls for 5 cups of sugar. Since we're only concerned with the additional sugar needed after adding the flour, we don't need to consider the sugar that Mary has already added or subtracted from the total.

So, the difference between the amount of sugar and flour she needs to add is:

5 cups (sugar needed) - 0 cups (sugar already added) = 5 cups of sugar.

Mary needs to add 5 more cups of sugar than the 3 cups of flour she has left to complete the recipe.

Question:Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how much flour Mary still needs to add. According to the recipe, she needs 6 cups of flour and has already added 5 cups.

Flour needed = Total flour - Flour used
Flour needed = 6 cups - 5 cups
Flour needed = 1 cup

Now, let's focus on the sugar and salt requirements. The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt.

Sugar needed = Total sugar - Sugar used (which is 0 since no sugar has been mentioned as added yet)
Sugar needed = 8 cups

Salt needed = Total salt - Salt used (which is also 0 since no salt has been mentioned as added yet)
Salt needed = 7 cups

To find out how many more cups of sugar than salt she needs to add, we subtract the amount of salt needed from the amount of sugar needed:

Cups of sugar more than salt = Sugar needed - Salt needed
Cups of sugar more than salt = 8 cups - 7 cups
Cups of sugar more than salt = 1 cup

So, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of sugar than 1 cup of salt.
Therefore, the answer is

1 cup.

The recipe calls for a certain amount of flour, and Mary has already added 3 cups and needs to add 6 more cups. To find out the total amount of flour required, we add the cups she has already put in to the cups she still needs to add:

Question:Baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries. If he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries How many more cakes than pastries did baker make?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Baker initially made:
- Cakes: 126
- Pastries: 48

He then sold:
- Cakes: 115
- Pastries: 81

To find out how many more cakes Baker made than pastries, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the initial number of cakes and do the same for pastries:

Initial cakes - Sold cakes = Remaining cakes
126 - 115 = 11 cakes

Initial pastries - Sold pastries = Remaining pastries
48 - 81 = -33 (since he made 33 fewer pastries than he sold)

Now, to find out how many more cakes Baker made than he originally made pastries, we add the negative number of pastries back to the initial pastries count:

Remaining cakes - (Negative remaining pastries) = Difference
11 + 33 = 44

Baker made 44 more cakes than pastries.

Baker initially made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. 

After selling, he has:
- Pastries remaining: 134 - 92
- Cakes remaining: 11 - 140 (since he sold more cakes than he made)

Now let's calculate the difference between the remaining pastries and cakes:
Difference = Pastries remaining - Cakes remaining

Let's do the math:

Pastries remaining = 134 - 92 = 42
Cakes remaining = 11 - 140 = -129 (since he sold more cakes than he had, it's a negative number)

Difference = 42 - (-129) = 42 + 129 = 171

So, Baker made 171 more pastries than cakes.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese in 7 days, we can multiply the number of days by the hours he spends on each language per day.

For English:
- Hours per day = 4
- Days = 7

Total hours for English = 4 hours/day * 7 days

For Chinese:
- Hours per day = 5
- Days = 7

Total hours for Chinese = 5 hours/day * 7 days

Now, let's add the totals together:

Total hours (English + Chinese) = Total hours for English + Total hours for Chinese

Let's do the math.

Total hours for English = 4 * 7 = 28 hours
Total hours for Chinese = 5 * 7 = 35 hours

Total hours (English + Chinese) = 28 + 35 = 63 hours

So, Ryan spends a total of 63 hours on learning English and Chinese in 7 days.

Question:Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many pages Frank read per day. Since there are 193 pages evenly distributed over 15 chapters, we can calculate the number of pages per chapter:

Pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters
Pages per chapter = 193 / 15

Now, let's do that calculation:

Pages per chapter = 193 / 15 ≈ 12.87 (approximately)

Since Frank cannot read a fraction of a page, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which means he read about 13 pages per chapter.

Next, to find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we divide the total number of days it took him by the number of chapters:

Chapters per day = Total days / Pages per chapter
Chapters per day = 660 / 13

Let's do this division:

Chapters per day = 660 / 13 ≈ 50.77 (approximately)

Again, since Frank can't read a fraction of a chapter, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which means he read approximately 50 chapters per day.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the number of pages in each chapter and then multiply that by the number of days he read.

If the book has 612 pages equally distributed over 24 chapters, we can calculate the number of pages per chapter by dividing the total number of pages by the number of chapters:

Pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters
Pages per chapter = 612 pages / 24 chapters

Now, let's do the calculation:

Pages per chapter = 612 / 24
Pages per chapter = 25.5 pages (approximately)

Since Frank read the entire book in 6 days, we can find out the daily average by dividing the total number of pages by the number of days:

Pages read per day = Total pages / Number of days
Pages read per day = 612 pages / 6 days

Let's do that calculation:

Pages read per day = 612 / 6
Pages read per day = 102 pages

So, Frank read approximately 102 pages per day.

Total pages = 2 * 405
Total pages = 810 pages

Next, we know Frank read the entire book in 664 days. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

Chapters per day = Total pages / Days to finish
Chapters per day = 810 pages / 664 days

Let's do the division:

Chapters per day ≈ 810 / 664
Chapters per day ≈ 1.217 (approximately)

So, Frank read approximately 1.217 chapters per day. Since it's not possible to read a fraction of a chapter, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Answer: Frank read 1 chapter per day.

Question:Every day Ryan spends 5 hours on learning chinese and some more hours on learning english. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning english?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
If Ryan spends 5 hours a day on learning Chinese, and he spends 2 hours more on learning English than Chinese, we can calculate the time spent on English as follows:

Time spent on English = Time spent on Chinese + 2 hours
Time spent on English = 5 hours + 2 hours
Time spent on English = 7 hours

So, Ryan spends 7 hours a day on learning English.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
7 hours.
