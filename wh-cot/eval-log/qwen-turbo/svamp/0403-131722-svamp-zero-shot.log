Question:2 birds were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
9 more birds than storks are sitting on the fence. 

Explanation:
- Initially, there are 2 birds on the fence.
- 5 more birds come, so now there are 2 + 5 = 7 birds.
- 4 more storks come, but we don't have a number for storks initially, so let's assume there are 0 storks at first.
- After the storks arrive, there are 0 + 4 = 4 storks.

Now, we calculate the difference between the number of birds and storks:
7 birds - 4 storks = 3 more birds than storks.

However, since the question asks for "how many more birds than storks," we add the initial 2 birds to the 3, because those were already there before the storks arrived:
3 (from the additional birds) + 2 (initial birds) = 5 more birds than storks.

Question:There were 73 parents, 724 pupils and 744 teachers in the program. How many people were present in the program?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find the total number of people present in the program, we need to add the number of parents, pupils, and teachers together.

Number of parents = 73
Number of pupils = 724
Number of teachers = 744

Total number of people = Number of parents + Number of pupils + Number of teachers
Total number of people = 73 + 724 + 744

Now, let's do the calculation:

Total number of people = 73 + 724 + 744
Total number of people = 1567

So, there were 1567 people present in the program.

Question:The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many buses are needed, we first need to determine the total number of students in the school and then divide that by the number of students that can fit on one bus.

Given:
- Number of classrooms = 87
- Students per classroom = 58
- Seats per bus = 2

Total students = Number of classrooms * Students per classroom
Total students = 87 * 58

Now, we'll calculate the total number of students:

Total students = 87 * 58 = 4986

Next, we'll divide the total number of students by the number of students that can fit on one bus to find out how many buses are needed:

Number of buses = Total students / Seats per bus
Number of buses = 4986 / 2

Let's do the division:

Number of buses = 4986 / 2 = 2493

Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you would need to round up to the nearest whole number because you can't have a bus with only half a seat. Therefore, you would need 2494 buses (since 2493 buses would leave 1 student without a seat).

The answer is 2494 buses. However, since the question asks for the minimum number needed, which would be the integer part of the calculation, the correct answer is 2493 buses.

Question:22 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 2 children altogether on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
30. 

To find out how many children got off the bus, we can start by calculating the total number of children on the bus before any got off. Initially, there were 22 children on the bus. Then, 40 children got on, so we add those to the initial count:

22 (initial children) + 40 (children got on) = 62 children.

But after some got off, there were only 2 children left. So, we subtract the final number from the total number to find out how many got off:

62 (total after getting on) - 2 (final number) = 60 children got off the bus. However, since this is an arithmetic mistake, we subtract the initial number of children again to correct for double-counting:

60 - 22 (initial children) = 38 children got off the bus. But the question asks for the answer in the format given, which is 30. This might be a rounding error or a misinterpretation of the problem, as 38 is the correct answer without any assumptions about rounding.

Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. According to the problem:

G = 635 (given)
B = G + 510 (there are 510 more boys than girls)

Now we can substitute G with 635:

B = 635 + 510

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we can multiply the number of grapes picked per day by the number of days.

Number of grapes per day = 244 drums
Number of days = 146

Total drums of grapes = Number of grapes per day * Number of days
Total drums of grapes = 244 * 146

Let's do the calculation:

Total drums of grapes = 35424

So, 35,424 drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days.

67 (current total) - 58 (new ones) = 9 bottle caps

He also threw away 60, so before throwing them away, he would have had:
9 (after finding new ones) + 60 (thrown away) = 69 bottle caps

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many oranges are harvested per day, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested by the number of oranges in each sack and then subtract the discarded sacks.

Number of sacks harvested per day = 76
Oranges per sack = 50
Discarded sacks = 64

Total oranges harvested per day = (Sacks harvested - Discarded sacks) * Oranges per sack
Total oranges harvested per day = (76 - 64) * 50

Let's calculate this:

Total oranges harvested per day = 12 * 50
Total oranges harvested per day = 600

So, they harvest 600 oranges per day.

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract his weekly rent from his weekly earnings and then multiply that by the number of weeks.

Lewis's weekly earnings: $491
Weekly rent: $216

Money earned per week after rent: $491 - $216

Now, let's do the calculation:

$491 - $216 = $275 (money earned per week)

Total money earned over 1181 weeks:
$275 * 1181

Let's compute this:

$275 * 1181 = $328,525

So, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $328,525.

If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many students participated in suggesting new food items, we can subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of students.

Total students = 450 (mashed potatoes) + 38 (bacon) + Rest

Given that there are 66 choices in total, and mashed potatoes and bacon account for 450 + 38 students, the rest would be the remaining students who suggested other items.

Rest = Total students - (mashed potatoes + bacon)
Rest = 66 - (450 + 38)

Let's calculate this:

Rest = 66 - 488
Rest = -422

However, the number of students cannot be negative. It seems there's an error in the calculation or the provided information, as 450 students already account for all 66 choices (since mashed potatoes and bacon are both included). If mashed potatoes and bacon represent all the suggested items, then no students suggested additional food items.

Therefore, the answer is 0 students participated in suggesting new food items.

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out the total number of sacks of oranges they will have after 26 days of harvest, we need to add the number of ripe oranges harvested each day to the number of unripe oranges harvested each day and then multiply by the number of days.

Number of ripe oranges per day = 28
Number of unripe oranges per day = 52
Number of days = 26

Total ripe oranges in 26 days = 28 * 26
Total unripe oranges in 26 days = 52 * 26

Now, let's calculate:

Total ripe oranges = 28 * 26 = 728
Total unripe oranges = 52 * 26 = 1352

Total sacks of oranges = Total ripe oranges + Total unripe oranges
Total sacks of oranges = 728 + 1352

Let's do the math:

Total sacks of oranges = 2080

So, after 26 days of harvest, they will have 2080 sacks of oranges.

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To calculate the total number of nails needed, we need to multiply the number of large planks by the nails per large plank and then add the result to the product of the number of small planks and the nails per small plank.

For large planks:
12 large planks * 15 nails per large plank = 180 nails

For small planks:
10 small planks * 5 nails per small plank = 50 nails

Now, add the two totals together:

2. Jerry initially had 3 action figures, and after adding 4 more, there were 3 + 4 = 7 action figures. Now, with 6 figures on the shelf, he removed 7 - 6 = 1 action figure. However, since the question asks for the number removed without specifying if it's one at a time or in total, we can only determine that at least one figure was removed.

Question:Dan has $ 4. He bought 99 candy bar for $ 3 each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how much money Dan spent on candy bars and how much is left, we can multiply the number of candy bars by the cost per bar and then subtract that from his initial amount.

Number of candy bars = 99
Cost per candy bar = $3

Total spent = Number of candy bars * Cost per candy bar
Total spent = 99 * $3

Now let's calculate the total spent:

Total spent = $297

Dan initially had $4, so we subtract the total spent from this amount to find out how much is left:

Money left = Initial amount - Total spent
Money left = $4 - $297

Money left = -$293

However, since it's not possible to have a negative amount of money left after spending, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the interpretation. If each candy bar actually costs $0.03 instead of $3, the calculation would be different:

If Cost per candy bar = $0.03
Total spent = 99 * $0.03
Total spent = $2.97

Money left = $4 - $2.97
Money left = $1.03

If that's the intended scenario, the correct answer would be $1.03. But based on the original information provided, the answer is $-293. Please clarify if the cost per candy bar should be $0.03.

To find out how many packs of cake Lucy bought, we can subtract the number of cookie packs from the total number of grocery packs.

Total grocery packs = Packs of cookies + Packs of cake
27 packs = 23 packs of cookies + Packs of cake

Now, let's solve for the packs of cake:

Answer: The answer is
Output:
8. 

To find out how many cookies are in each bag, we need to first determine the total number of cookies without the ones that are not in bags. Since there are 52 cookies in total and 15 of them are candies, we subtract the candies from the total:

52 (total cookies) - 15 (candies) = 37 cookies.

Now, since there are 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags:

37 cookies / 26 bags = 1.42857...

However, since cookies cannot be divided into fractions, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 cookie per bag. This means each bag has 8 cookies, as 15 candies would leave room for 26 bags with 8 cookies each.

Input:
Question:Steven has 12 peaches. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven who has 67 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many peaches Jake has, we can follow these steps:

1. Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill.
2. If we subtract 67 from the number of peaches Steven has, we get the number of peaches Jill has.
3. Since Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, we then subtract 4 from the number of peaches Jill has to find out how many Jake has.

Let's do the math:

- Jill's peaches = Steven's peaches - 67
- Jill's peaches = 12 (Steven's) - 67
- Jill's peaches = -55 (since Steven has 12 and 67 is more)

Now, for Jake:

- Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches - 4
- Jake's peaches = -55 - 4
- Jake's peaches = -59

However, it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or interpretation. Assuming the information provided is correct, Jake cannot have any peaches because he would have fewer than zero. If the intention was to say that Steven has 67 fewer peaches than Jill, then the calculation would be different.

If the intention is that Steven has 67 fewer peaches than Jill, we would calculate:

- Jill's peaches = 12 (Steven's) + 67
- Jill's peaches = 89
- Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches - 4
- Jake's peaches = 89 - 4
- Jake's peaches = 85

In this case, Jake would have 85 peaches.

Please clarify if the original information is correct or if it should be as stated above.

Question:Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many more peaches Steven has than Jill, we first need to determine the number of peaches Jake has.

Since Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 16 peaches, Jake has:
\( 16 - 9 = 7 \) peaches.

Now, Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill. So, if Jake has 7 peaches, Jill has:
\( 7 - 18 = -11 \) peaches (which doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of peaches).

However, since the question asks for the difference between the number of peaches Steven has and the number Jill has, we'll use the positive value for Jill's peaches, assuming there might be a mistake in the problem statement or it's a hypothetical situation where Jill has no peaches at all.

In that case, the difference is:
\( 16 - 0 = 16 \)

So, Steven has 16 more peaches than Jill.

Question:There are 11 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. How many peaches are in the baskets altogether?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find the total number of peaches in the baskets, we can add the number of red peaches and the number of green peaches from each basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

Each basket has:
- Red peaches: 10
- Green peaches: 18

Total peaches per basket = Red + Green
Total peaches per basket = 10 + 18

Now, we multiply by the number of baskets (11):
Total peaches = Total per basket * Number of baskets
Total peaches = (10 + 18) * 11

Let's do the calculation:

Total peaches = 28 * 11
Total peaches = 308

Explanation: Since each basket contains 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, there are a total of 4 + 3 = 7 peaches per basket. If there are a total of 7 peaches in all the baskets combined, then there must be 7 peaches / 7 peaches per basket = 1 basket.

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find the length of Jesse's room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area of the carpet = 14 square feet
- Width of the room = 7 feet

We can rearrange the formula to solve for the length:

\[ \text{Length} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Width}} \]
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{14 \text{ ft}^2}{7 \text{ ft}} \]
\[ \text{Length} = 2 \text{ ft} \]

So, the length of Jesse's room is 2 feet.

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to follow these steps:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog.
2. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches.

So, if the grasshopper's jump is 39 inches and that's 19 inches more than the frog's jump, we can calculate the frog's jump by subtracting 19 inches from the grasshopper's jump:

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 19 inches
Frog's jump = 39 inches - 19 inches
Frog's jump = 20 inches

3. The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog.

Now, we subtract 12 inches from the frog's jump to find the mouse's jump:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 12 inches
Mouse's jump = 20 inches - 12 inches
Mouse's jump = 8 inches

The mouse jumped 8 inches.

Question:The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we first need to determine the distance the frog jumped and then add 20 inches to that to find the mouse's jump.

The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 10 inches
Frog's jump = 19 inches + 10 inches
Frog's jump = 29 inches

Now, the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump + 20 inches
Mouse's jump = 29 inches + 20 inches
Mouse's jump = 49 inches

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:
Distance difference = Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump
Distance difference = 49 inches - 19 inches
Distance difference = 30 inches

So, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we subtract Dad's strawberries weight from Marco's strawberries weight.

Marco's strawberries: 19 pounds
Dad's strawberries: 4 pounds (total weight minus Marco's weight)

Difference: Marco's weight - Dad's weight
Difference: 19 pounds - 4 pounds

Now, let's do the calculation:

Difference = 15 pounds

So, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds more than his dad's.

Question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weigh now, we can start by adding the weight of strawberries they collected together and then subtracting the weight that was lost.

Total weight before loss: 36 pounds
Weight lost: 8 pounds
Weight of Marco's strawberries after loss: 12 pounds

First, let's find out how much strawberries Marco had initially:

Marco's strawberries + Dad's strawberries = Total before loss
12 pounds + Dad's strawberries = 36 pounds

Now, we solve for Dad's strawberries:

Dad's strawberries = 36 pounds - 12 pounds
Dad's strawberries = 24 pounds

After losing 8 pounds, Dad's strawberries would weigh:

Dad's strawberries after loss = Dad's strawberries - Loss
Dad's strawberries after loss = 24 pounds - 8 pounds
Dad's strawberries after loss = 16 pounds

So, his dad's strawberries now weigh 16 pounds.

Question:The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the frog's jump distance since the grasshopper jumped 25 inches more than the frog.
2. Find out the mouse's jump distance, which is 16 inches less than the frog's.

Let's do the math:

Grasshopper's jump = 21 inches
Grasshopper's extra jump over frog = 25 inches

So, Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - Extra jump for grasshopper
Frog's jump = 21 inches - 25 inches

Now let's calculate the frog's jump:
Frog's jump = -4 inches (since it's a negative value, the frog actually jumped 4 inches)

Next, we find the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 16 inches
Mouse's jump = -4 inches - 16 inches

Now let's calculate the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump = -20 inches (since it's a negative value, the mouse jumped 20 inches)

Finally, to find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse:
Distance difference = Grasshopper's jump - Mouse's jump
Distance difference = 21 inches - (-20 inches)

Now let's add the positive value:
Distance difference = 21 inches + 20 inches

Distance difference = 41 inches

The answer is the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse.

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add compared to salt, we first need to determine the total amount of sugar and salt required by the recipe.

The recipe calls for:
- 6 cups of flour (which she has already added 5 cups)
- 8 cups of sugar
- 7 cups of salt

Now, subtract the flour she has already added from the total flour needed:
6 cups (total flour) - 5 cups (added flour) = 1 cup of flour left to add

Next, we'll calculate the difference between the sugar and salt requirements:
8 cups (sugar) - 7 cups (salt) = 1 cup more sugar than salt

So, Mary needs to add 1 cup more of sugar than salt.

Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many cakes Baker still has, we need to start with the initial number of cakes he made and then subtract the ones he sold and add the new ones he bought.

Initial cakes: 121
Sold cakes: 105
New cakes bought: 170

Cakes remaining = Initial cakes - Sold cakes + New cakes bought
Cakes remaining = 121 - 105 + 170

Cakes remaining = 16 + 170
Cakes remaining = 186

Since there are -129 cakes remaining, it means Baker made 42 more pastries than cakes. However, since there were actually fewer cakes than the number baked, we should consider only the difference between the original amounts, which is 134 pastries - 11 cakes = 123 more pastries than cakes.

Question:Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the number of days it took him to finish the book.

Total chapters = 15
Days to finish = 660

Chapters per day = Total chapters / Days to finish
Chapters per day = 15 / 660

Now let's calculate that.
Chapters per day = 15 / 660 = 0.0227 (approximately)

So, Frank read approximately 0.0227 chapters per day. Since it's not possible to read a fraction of a chapter, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because he can't read a fraction of a chapter in a day.

Question:Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
Answer: The answer is
Output:
To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages in the book and then divide that by the number of days it took him to read.

The book has 2 chapters and each chapter has 405 pages. So the total number of pages is:
2 chapters * 405 pages/chapter

Let's do the calculation:

Total pages = 2 * 405
Total pages = 810 pages

Frank read the entire book in 664 days. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

Chapters per day = Total pages / Number of days
Chapters per day = 810 pages / 664 days

Now let's perform the division:

Chapters per day ≈ 810 / 664
Chapters per day ≈ 1.219 (approximately)

So, Frank read approximately 1.219 chapters per day. Since you can't read a fraction of a chapter, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which means Frank read 1 chapter per day.
