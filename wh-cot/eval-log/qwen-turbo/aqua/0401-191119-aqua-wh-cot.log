Input:
Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 2272, 875, 3-digit number N, same remainder, sum of digits of N.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What does it mean for two numbers to have the same remainder when divided by a third number?
2. How can we find the possible values of N that satisfy this condition for both 2272 and 875?
3. Once we have the possible values of N, how can we determine the sum of its digits?
4. Are there any shortcuts or patterns to find the sum of the digits without actually calculating all the values of N?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. Having the same remainder means that when we divide both 2272 and 875 by N, the remainders are equal. This implies that N divides evenly into the difference between 2272 and 875.
2. We can find the potential divisors by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference (2272 - 875) and the smallest possible value of N (which is 100 because it's a 3-digit number). The GCD will give us a common factor that both 2272 and 875 share with N, and the remainder will be the same for both numbers when divided by this factor.
3. To find the sum of the digits of N, we'll need to list out the potential values of N and then add up their digits. However, there might be a pattern or shortcut if we can determine the range of possible remainders and the divisibility rules for the digits of N.
4. Since the remainders are the same for both numbers, the last digit of N must be the same as the remainder when 2272 is divided by N. We can start by finding the remainder of 2272 when divided by 100, and then look for the smallest three-digit number that gives the same remainder for both 2272 and 875.

Step 4: Apply the logic:
- Calculate the remainder of 2272 when divided by 100: 2272 % 100 = 72
- Since the remainder is 72, the last digit of N must be 2.
- Now, we need to find the smallest three-digit number ending in 2 that gives the same remainder for both 2272 and 875 when divided by it. This means we're looking for a number of the form N = 100k + 2, where k is an integer.

Let's check the remainders for k = 1 (since 100 * 1 + 2 = 102):
- 2272 % 102 = 72
- 875 % 102 = 75 (not the same remainder)

We continue this process until we find a match for 875. Since the remainders are the same for both numbers, we don't need to check more than a few values.

Step 5: Conclusion:
After checking a few values, we find that when k = 7 (since 100 * 7 + 2 = 702), both 2272 and 875 have the same remainder when divided by 702:
- 2272 % 702 = 72
- 875 % 702 = 72

The sum of the digits of N (702) is 7 + 0 + 2 = 9.

However, since the answer choices are not among the given options, there seems to be an error in the question or answer choices. The sum of the digits of N should be 9, not any of the provided options. If the correct answer is indeed 9, then the answer is not listed in the options provided, and we cannot choose from them.

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question - identical bouquets, white tulips, red tulips, no flowers left out.
Step 2: Decompose the question into smaller parts:
- We need to find the greatest number of bouquets.
- Each bouquet should have the same number of white and red tulips.
- Total white tulips: 28
- Total red tulips: 98
- No flowers left out means we must use all the tulips.

Step 3: Analyze the constraints:
- To maximize the number of bouquets, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of white and red tulips, as this will give us the number of tulips that can be distributed equally between bouquets.
- The GCD of 28 (white) and 98 (red) will determine the number of tulips per bouquet.

Step 4: Calculate the GCD:
- The prime factorization of 28 is 2^2 * 7.
- The prime factorization of 98 is 2 * 7^2.
- The common factors are 2 and 7. Their GCD is 2 * 7 = 14.

Step 5: Determine the number of bouquets:
- Each bouquet will have 14 white tulips and 14 red tulips, as these are the common factors.
- Since there are 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, we can divide the total number of each color by the number of tulips per bouquet to find out how many bouquets we can make:
   - White bouquets: 28 / 14 = 2 bouquets
   - Red bouquets: 98 / 14 = 7 bouquets

Step 6: Since the number of white bouquets is less than the number of red bouquets, we can only make as many bouquets as the number of white bouquets, as we cannot have more white bouquets than red ones.

Answer: The greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is 2 (since there are only 2 white bouquets possible), but since we're looking for the greatest number of bouquets without any restriction on the number of bouquets of each type, we can choose to make only the white bouquets, as we can always have 0 red bouquets.

Therefore, the correct answer is the number of white bouquets, which is 2. However, since this is not an option, we need to choose the next closest multiple of 2 in the answer choices, which is 4 (Option A). This implies that we can make 4 bouquets with 4 bouquets consisting only of white tulips, and the remaining red tulips can be distributed separately or not at all.

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3.

When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number? Answer Choices: (A) 84 (B) 66 (C) 28 (D) 19 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: one third, three-fourths, a number, equals 21.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the mathematical operation to find one-third of a number?2. How do we calculate three-fourths of a number?3. Given that one-third of three-fourths of a number is 21, how do we set up the equation to find the number?4. What algebraic method should we use to solve for the unknown number?5. Which answer choice correctly represents the number found?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions, we can infer that:
- To find one-third of a number, we multiply the number by 1/3.
- To find three-fourths of a number, we multiply the number by 3/4.
- The problem states that (1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21, where x is the unknown number. We need to solve for x.

Let's set up the equation and solve for x:

(1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (1/3) * (3/4), which is (4/3) * (3/4), to isolate x:

x = 21 * (4/3) * (3/4)

Now, let's simplify:

x = 21 * (4 * 3) / (3 * 4)
x = 21 * 12 / 12
x = 21

The given answer choices do not match the calculated value of x, which is 21. There seems to be an error in the answer choices provided, as 21 is not among them. However, based on the calculation, the correct answer should be 21, not listed in the options.

Therefore, the correct answer, according to the calculation, is not provided in the answer choices.

Question:At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:conference, team, 4 men, 4 women, presenters, chosen, different groups, composed of men only, women only, different if at least one presenter is different..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without restrictions?2. What is the formula for finding the number of combinations when selecting a certain number of items from a larger group, considering order does not matter?3. Who are the individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference?4. Where does the constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" apply in this problem?5. When is this constraint relevant - during the selection of presenters or after they have been chosen?6. Why is it important to consider the exclusion of teams with all men or all women in the selection process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without any restrictions, you would use the concept of permutations if order mattered or combinations if order was not significant. Since order doesn't seem to matter here, we'll use combinations. The formula for combinations (denoted as C(n, k)) is:C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)where n is the total number of individuals available and k is the number of presenters to choose.The individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference are all men and all women, regardless of gender. The constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" applies to the selection process itself.This constraint is relevant during the selection stage, as it prevents the formation of homogeneous teams. It ensures diversity in the composition of the presenting team. By excluding these specific combinations, the pool of potential presenters broadens, allowing for balanced teams with both men and women.Considering this exclusion is important because it reflects the desired balance and inclusivity in the conference's representation. If teams with all men or all women were allowed, it would violate the goal of having a diverse lineup of presenters. Therefore, the exclusion rule must be applied during the selection process to guarantee an appropriate mix of presenters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

Question:At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- 10 speakers: 1 PM, 1 MP, 8 others (MLAs)
- Protocol: PM speaks before MP, MP speaks before MLA
- Order matters
- Determine the number of ways the meeting can be held

Step 2: Analyze the protocol:
- We have a fixed order for the first two speakers (PM, MP).
- After that, the MP can speak before any of the 8 MLAs.
- The remaining 7 MLAs can then speak in any order among themselves.

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways:
- The first two speakers are fixed, so we don't count them in the permutation.
- For the next speaker (MP), there are 8 choices (any of the MLAs).
- Once the MP speaks, there are 7 remaining MLAs who can speak next, and so on.
- The remaining 6 MLAs can be arranged in 6! ways.

Step 4: Apply the fixed order:
- Since the order of the first two speakers is fixed, we multiply the number of ways the remaining MLAs can be arranged by the factorial of the number of remaining MLAs.

Total arrangements = 8 (choices for MP) * 6! (arrangements of the remaining MLAs)

Step 5: Calculate the final answer:
Total arrangements = 8 * 6! = 8 * 720 = 5760

However, this answer is not among the given choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the answer choices provided. The correct answer should be 5760, but none of the options match this value. If the answer choices are correct, there might be an issue with the question or the options given. If the intended answer is indeed 5760, it's not represented in the options provided.

Without the correct answer choice, we cannot definitively provide the correct answer from the given options. If the question is correct, the correct answer would be 5760, but since that's not an option, we cannot select from the given choices.

Question:A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n?
 Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:box, balls, marked successively, 1 to n, 45 different ways, two balls selected, ball with number 3 marked, not selected, value of n.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of ways two balls can be selected from the box without considering ball 3?2. How many balls are initially in the box if we need to find the combinations without selecting ball 3?3. What type of counting principle is involved in determining the number of combinations when one item is excluded?4. In how many ways can two balls be selected from the box if all balls are distinct and numbered from 1 to n-1?5. Given that the selection of ball 3 is prohibited, how does this restriction affect the total number of possible pairs from the remaining balls?6. What is the relationship between the value of n and the answer choices provided (A, B, C, D, E), indicating the correct number of balls in the box?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the total number of ways to select two balls from a box without considering ball 3, we employ the combination formula. The formula for combinations is C(n-1, k-1), where n represents the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. Since we want to exclude ball 3, we effectively have n-1 balls to choose from (n being the initial number). If we let k be 2, the calculation becomes C(n-1, 1) or simply (n-1) since there's only one way to choose one ball from the remaining n-1.To find the initial number of balls, we need to consider that we're looking for combinations without selecting ball 3. This implies that there must be n-1 balls in the box, as ball 3 is accounted for in the exclusion.The counting principle involved here is the "Rule of Combinations with Exclusion," which states that when one item is excluded, you subtract the number of combinations with the excluded item from the total number of combinations without any restrictions.If all balls are distinct and numbered from 1 to n-1, the number of ways to select two balls would be C(n-1, 2), which simplifies to (n-1) * (n-2) / 2 using the combination formula.Given that ball 3 is prohibited, the total number of possible pairs from the remaining balls is reduced by one, so it's C(n-1, 2) - 1.In terms of the answer choices A, B, C, D, and E, if the correct number of balls in the box corresponds to the value of n that makes the calculated result match one of those choices, then we need to evaluate each choice against the formula for combinations without considering ball 3. The relationship between n and the answer choices will depend on the specific values provided in the options, as different n values will lead to different combinations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: M = abc, N = cba, M > N, M - N + 396c = 990, three-digit number, M > 300.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between M and N due to their structure (M = abc, N = cba)?
2. How can we determine the conditions for M to be greater than 300?
3. What does the equation M - N + 396c = 990 tell us about the relationship between the digits a, b, and c?
4. How many possible values of a, b, and c exist for a three-digit number, considering the constraints?
5. How can we count the number of M values that satisfy M > 300 and the given equation?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
1. Since M = abc and N = cba, M is formed by placing the digits in ascending order (a < b < c), while N is formed by placing them in descending order (c > b > a).
2. For M to be greater than 300, the hundreds digit a must be at least 3, and the thousands digit c must be at least 1 (since b is in between a and c).
3. The equation M - N + 396c = 990 suggests that the difference between the sums of the digits in M and N is 396 times the units digit c. Since M > N, the hundreds digit a must be at least 1 more than the units digit c, and the tens digit b must be at least 1 less than the units digit c.
4. There are 9 choices for the hundreds digit (a can be 3, 4, ..., 9), 10 choices for the tens digit (b can be 0, 1, ..., 9), and 10 choices for the units digit (c can be 1, 2, ..., 9). However, we need to account for the constraints imposed by the equation and the requirement that M > 300.
5. We need to find the number of valid combinations for a, b, and c that satisfy the equation and the conditions for M > 300. We can start by finding the smallest possible M (311) and the largest possible M (999) that still meet the equation. Then, count the number of steps between these two values, considering the constraints.

Step 4: Calculate the smallest and largest possible M values:
- Smallest M (311): M - N = 311 - 113 = 198, so 198 + 396c = 990 => c = 2
- Largest M (999): M - N = 999 - 99 = 900, so 900 + 396c = 990 => c = 1
Since c must be at least 2, the smallest possible M with c = 2 is 322. Now, we need to find the number of steps from 322 to 999, inclusive, that are valid.

Step 5: Count the number of valid M values:
- From 322 to 399 (with c = 2), there are 78 steps (399 - 322 + 1).
- From 400 to 999 (with c = 3), there are 599 steps (999 - 400 + 1).
- Adding these together gives us 78 + 599 = 677 valid M values.

However, we need to subtract the cases where M = 322 or M = 999 because they are not strictly greater than 300. So, subtracting 2 gives us 677 - 2 = 675.

The answer choices do not include 675, but since the question asks for the number of values more than 300, and 675 is greater than 300, the correct answer is (E) None, as none of the provided choices match the actual count.

 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: three-digit number, sum of digits, sum of squares of digits, reversed number, subtraction of 495.
Step 2: Identify the unknowns and relationships:
- Let the three-digit number be ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits.
- We know that A + B + C = 17 (sum of digits).
- We also know that A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 (sum of squares of digits).
- Subtracting 495 from the number gives (ABC - 495) = CBA (reversed number).

Step 3: Analyze the relationships:
- Since the reversed number has the same digits, we can write (ABC - 495) = 100C + 10B + A.
- From the sum of digits, we have A + B + C = 17, so A = 17 - B - C.
- From the sum of squares, we can substitute A in terms of B and C: (17 - B - C)^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109.

Step 4: Simplify and solve for the digits:
- Expand the square and simplify: 289 - 34B - 34C + B^2 + C^2 = 109.
- Move terms with B and C to one side: B^2 + C^2 - 34B - 34C + 180 = 0.
- This is a quadratic equation in terms of B and C. Since the digits are single digits, B and C must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- We can try different combinations of B and C to find a solution that satisfies the conditions.

Step 5: Test the answer choices:
- Choice A: 368
- Sum of digits: 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 (matches)
- Sum of squares: 3^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 36 + 64 = 109 (matches)
- Subtracting 495: 368 - 495 = -127, which is not the reverse of 368 (not reversed).

- Choice B: 377
- Sum of digits: 3 + 7 + 7 = 17 (matches)
- Sum of squares: 3^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 + 49 = 107 (not 109, so not a match)

- Choice C: 288
- Sum of digits: 2 + 8 + 8 = 18 (not 17, so not a match)

- Choice D: 997
- Sum of digits: 9 + 9 + 7 = 25 (not 17, so not a match)

- Choice E: 112
- Sum of digits: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 (not 17, so not a match)

From the analysis, none of the answer choices match all the conditions. However, we can see that Choice B is the closest, as it only differs by 2 in the sum of squares. This might be a case of a typo or an error in the question, but since the question specifically asks for the number, we cannot provide an answer without more information.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Q (positive integer), 5 factors.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the number of factors and the prime factorization of a number?
2. How many factors does a number have if it is a perfect square?
3. How many factors does a number have if it is a product of two distinct prime numbers?
4. Are there any other special cases where a number might have exactly 5 factors?
5. Based on the above information, what must be true about Q if it has exactly 5 factors?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
- A number's factors come from its prime factorization. If a number is a perfect power (like a square or cube), it will have more factors than just the unique prime factors raised to different powers. For example, a perfect square has at least three factors (1, the number itself, and the square root).
- A number with exactly two distinct prime factors will have (1 + 2) factors, which is 3. This is because there's one factor for each prime, and one factor for their product.
- If a number has exactly three prime factors, it would have (1 + 2 + 2) factors, which is 5. This occurs when the number is a product of two different prime numbers raised to the same power.

Step 4: Conclusion based on the analysis:
Since Q has exactly 5 factors, it must be a number that is a product of two different prime numbers raised to the same power. This is because only such a number will have the combination of 1, the number itself, and the two prime factors raised to different powers (one for each prime).

Therefore, the correct statement about Q is that it must be a number that can be expressed as \( p^2 \times q^2 \) for two distinct primes \( p \) and \( q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are each raised to the power of 2. This ensures that Q has exactly 5 factors: 1, \( p^2 \), \( q^2 \), \( pq \), and \( Q \).

Answer: Q must be a perfect square of a prime number, i.e., \( Q = p^2 \) for some prime number \( p \).

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Joe, Joe's sister, Joe's father, their ages sum up to 100, future age relationships.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many equations can we form based on the given conditions?
2. What are the relationships between Joe, his sister, and their father's ages that we can deduce?
3. How can we set up equations to represent these relationships mathematically?
4. How can we solve these equations simultaneously to find Joe's father's age?

Step 3: Analyze the relationships:
- When Joe is as old as his father, let's call this point J1 and F1 respectively.
- At that time, Joe's sister's age will be S2.
- We know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now, so S2 = 2S1.
- Also, when Joe is as old as his father, their ages will sum up to 100, so J1 + F1 = 100.

- The second condition also tells us that when Joe is as old as his father (F1), his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father (S1), so F1 = 2(S1 - J1).

Step 4: Set up equations and solve:
From the second condition, we can substitute F1 with 2(S1 - J1) in the first condition:
J1 + 2(S1 - J1) = 100
Simplify:
J1 + 2S1 - 2J1 = 100
S1 = 50 (since J1 and S1 are related to each other)

Now, from the first condition again, we have:
J1 + F1 = 100
Since S1 = 50, we can substitute it back into the second condition:
F1 = 2(S1 - J1) = 2(50 - J1)
We know that F1 = J1 at some point, so:
J1 = 2(50 - J1)
Solve for J1:
J1 = 100 - 2J1
3J1 = 100
J1 = 100 / 3 ≈ 33.33

Now, since Joe's father is twice as old as Joe when Joe is 33.33, F1 = 2 * 33.33 ≈ 66.66.

However, we need to account for the fact that the ages must be whole numbers. Since Joe's father's age is closest to 66.66, we round it down to 66 years old. This means that at some point, Joe's father will be 66 years old, and Joe will be 33 years old.

At that point, Joe's sister's age will be 2 times her current age, which is:
S2 = 2 * S1 = 2 * 50 = 100 years old.

But this doesn't match the sum of 100 for Joe, his sister, and his father's ages. There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement or interpretation, as the sum of 100 cannot be achieved with the given conditions.

Given the options, there is no correct answer because the problem as stated does not lead to a valid solution.

What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: club, members, ages in arithmetic progression (A.P.), common difference of 3 months, youngest member's age, sum of ages, number of members.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we find the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence when given the first term, common difference, and the sum of the sequence?
2. What is the relationship between the sum of an arithmetic series and its individual terms (first term, last term, and number of terms)?
3. How can we find the last term of the sequence knowing the first term and the common difference?
4. Given the youngest member's age and the common difference, how can we find the first term of the sequence?
5. With the first term and the last term, how can we determine the number of terms in the sequence?

Step 3: Analyze the relationships:
- In an arithmetic sequence, the sum of n terms can be found using the formula: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n - 1)d] \), where \( S_n \) is the sum, \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( d \) is the common difference.
- We know that \( a = 7 \) years (the youngest member's age) and \( d = 3 \) months (common difference).
- Since the common difference is in months and the sum is in years, we need to convert the sum to months before applying the formula.

First, convert the sum of ages from years to months:
\( 250 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 3000 \text{ months} \)

Now apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\( 3000 = \frac{n}{2} [2 \times 7 + (n - 1) \times 3] \)

Step 4: Solve for n (number of terms):
\( 3000 = \frac{n}{2} [14 + 3n - 3] \)
\( 3000 = \frac{n}{2} [11 + 3n] \)
\( 6000 = n(11 + 3n) \)
\( 6000 = 11n + 3n^2 \)
\( 3n^2 + 11n - 6000 = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for n. Factoring or using the quadratic formula will give us the possible values for n.

Step 5: Find the integer solution(s) for n:
Factoring or solving the quadratic equation gives us two solutions: \( n \approx -40 \) and \( n \approx 25 \). Since the number of members cannot be negative, we discard the negative value and keep \( n = 25 \).

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 25.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

After finding the value of x, which answer choice corresponds to that value?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
Since we have two equations with two variables, we can use substitution to solve for x. We can substitute y = 3x into the first equation (6x - y = 24) to eliminate y and solve for x.

Step 4: Substitute y from the second equation into the first equation:
6x - (3x) = 24

Step 5: Simplify and solve for x:
6x - 3x = 24
3x = 24
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

The value of x is 8, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

Therefore, the answer is (A) 8.

 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: greatest common factor (GCF), least common multiple (LCM), two positive integers, one integer is 350, the other integer unknown.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we find the other integer given the GCF and LCM?
2. What is the relationship between the GCF, LCM, and the two integers?
3. If the GCF of two numbers is 11, and one of them is 350, how can we express the other number in terms of 11?
4. How can we use the LCM to find the value of the other integer?
5. Which of the answer choices can be the product of 11 and a factor of 7700 that also divides 350?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
1. We know that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if one integer is 350 and the GCF is 11, we can find the other integer by dividing the LCM by 350.
2. The relationship between GCF and LCM is that GCF * LCM = Product of the two numbers. In this case, the other integer multiplied by 11 equals the LCM.
3. Since 350 = 11 * 32 (with 11 as the GCF), the other integer must be a multiple of 32 because it's not divisible by 11.
4. To find the other integer, we divide the LCM (7700) by 350, then divide the result by 11.
5. We need to check which of the answer choices is a multiple of 32 and has a product with 11 that equals 7700.

Let's calculate the other integer:

LCM / 350 = 7700 / 350 = 22
22 / 11 = 2

The other integer is 2 times the GCF, which is 11 * 2 = 22.

Now let's check which answer choice matches this result:

(A) 242 (not a multiple of 32)
(B) 308 (not a multiple of 32)
(C) 352 (matches the result, as 352 = 11 * 32)
(D) 412 (not a multiple of 32)
(E) 456 (not a multiple of 32)

The correct answer is (C) 352.

Question:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: boy, top of stairs, 10 steps, one or two steps, ways.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What kind of counting problem is this? It seems to involve a recursive pattern or dynamic programming.
2. How can we approach this problem? We need to consider the possible ways the boy can reach each step, starting from the first step and moving up to the tenth step.
3. Is there a pattern or rule we can apply? The boy can either take one step or two steps at a time. So, we need to count the number of ways he can reach each step using both options.
4. How do we handle the base cases? The first step can only be reached by taking one step, and the second step can be reached by taking one or two steps.
5. How do we account for the recursive nature? For each step, we add the number of ways to reach the previous step (using one step) to the number of ways to reach the step before that (using two steps).
6. What is the stopping condition? We need to count up to the tenth step.
7. Can we use a formula or recurrence relation? We can use a recursive formula to represent the number of ways to reach step \( n \), denoted as \( W_n \), where \( W_1 = 1 \) (one step to reach the first step) and \( W_2 = 2 \) (one or two steps to reach the second step), and for \( n > 2 \), \( W_n = W_{n-1} + W_{n-2} \) (accounting for one-step and two-step options).

Step 3: Apply the recursive formula to find the number of ways to reach the tenth step:
- \( W_3 = W_2 + W_1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \) (one or two steps to reach the third step)
- \( W_4 = W_3 + W_2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \) (one or two steps to reach the fourth step)
- Continue this pattern until we reach \( W_{10} \).

Step 4: Calculate \( W_{10} \):
- \( W_5 = W_4 + W_3 = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
- \( W_6 = W_5 + W_4 = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
- \( W_7 = W_6 + W_5 = 13 + 8 = 21 \)
- \( W_8 = W_7 + W_6 = 21 + 13 = 34 \)
- \( W_9 = W_8 + W_7 = 34 + 21 = 55 \)
- \( W_{10} = W_9 + W_8 = 55 + 34 = 89 \)

Step 5: The answer is 89, which corresponds to option B.

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:probability, Stock A, increase in value, next month, probability, Stock B, increase in value, next month, greatest value, probability, neither of these two events, occur.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the probability that neither event occurs?2. What is the relationship between the probabilities of Stock A and Stock B increasing in value that we need to consider?3. Who or what is being measured in this scenario (the probability of Stock A and Stock B not increasing)?4. In what context are these probabilities calculated - individual stocks or a portfolio?5. When does the calculation of the probability that neither event occurs become relevant?6. Why is it important to find the greatest value for the probability that neither event happens?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of finance and investing, the probability of events concerning individual stocks or a portfolio is often analyzed to assess risk and potential returns. To calculate the probability that neither event occurs, we use the concept of complementary events. If we denote the probability of Stock A increasing in value as P(A) and the probability of Stock B increasing as P(B), the probability that neither stock increases can be found using the formula:1. The operation used for this is the multiplication of the probabilities of the complementary events not happening, which is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)). This is because the probability of both events not occurring is the product of the probabilities that each event does not occur individually.2. The relationship between the probabilities of Stock A and Stock B increasing is crucial because they are negatively correlated. If one stock has a higher chance of increasing, it implies that the other might have a lower chance, and vice versa. Investors need to consider this diversification aspect when determining the overall portfolio risk.3. In this scenario, the probability of Stock A and Stock B not increasing in value is what's being measured. This is an indicator of the likelihood of a loss or no return for the combined investment in these stocks.4. These probabilities are calculated for individual stocks, as well as for a portfolio where they might be combined, to evaluate the collective risk and optimize asset allocation.5. The calculation of the probability that neither event occurs becomes relevant during risk management, portfolio optimization, or decision-making for investors who want to minimize losses and maximize potential gains.6. It is important to find the greatest value for the probability that neither event happens because a higher probability indicates a lower likelihood of simultaneous positive returns on both stocks. This helps investors make more conservative decisions or diversify their investments to reduce the overall portfolio risk. By understanding these probabilities, investors can better manage their expectations and strategies.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: quadratic equation, x² - 5x + k = 0, two real and distinct roots, largest integral value of 'k'.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What are the conditions for a quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots?2. How can we determine the discriminant of a quadratic equation to analyze its roots?3. What is the relationship between the discriminant and the value of 'k' in the equation x² - 5x + k = 0?4. How do we find the largest integral value of 'k' that ensures the discriminant is positive?5. Which answer choice corresponds to the maximum value of 'k' that meets these conditions?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
1. A quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 has two real and distinct roots if its discriminant (b² - 4ac) is greater than 0.
2. The discriminant of the equation x² - 5x + k = 0 is (-5)² - 4 * 1 * k = 25 - 4k.
3. For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, we need 25 - 4k > 0, which simplifies to k < 25/4.
4. Since we're looking for the largest integral value of 'k', we need to find the largest integer less than 25/4. 25/4 is approximately 6.25, so the largest integer less than this is 6.
5. Comparing the answer choices, we see that (D) 8 is the only one that is less than 6.25 and is an integer.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 105 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) 525
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question - lime soda bottles, 10, two groups, 5 members each, ways to create groups.
Step 2: Decompose the question into smaller parts - 
- We have 10 lime soda bottles to distribute among two groups of 5 members each.
- The order of the groups matters (since it's not just about selecting 5 bottles for one group and the rest for the other).
- We need to find the number of ways to form these groups, which is a combinatorial problem involving combinations with repetition.

Step 3: Analyze the problem - We can treat this as a stars and bars problem, where we have 10 stars (representing the bottles) and 1 bar (to separate the groups). Since each group has 5 members, we need to place 4 bars to divide the 10 bottles into two groups of 5.

Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars - There are a total of 10+1=11 positions, and we need to choose 4 of them for the bars. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula with repetition:
C(n+k-1, k) = C(11, 4)

Step 5: Apply the formula - C(11, 4) = 11! / (4! * (11-4)!) = 11! / (4! * 7!) = (11*10*9*8) / (4*3*2*1) = 330

Step 6: Match the result with the answer choices - The result we got is 330, which is not listed in the options. However, we should check if there's a mistake in our calculation or if the options are given incorrectly. 

Looking at the options, we notice that the choices are not consecutive numbers, suggesting that they might be arranged differently. Let's try to find the closest option to our calculated value:

- 90 is too low
- 105 is also too low
- 126 is closer but still not exact
- 252 seems to be twice our calculated value, which could be due to overcounting (since we might have counted each arrangement twice if the groups are indistinguishable)
- 525 is much higher than our calculated value

Considering that we might have overcounted because the groups are indistinguishable, we need to divide our result by 2 to account for the duplicate arrangements. So, 330 / 2 = 165.

None of the provided answer choices match our corrected value of 165. It seems there might be an error in the answer choices given, and the correct answer should be 165 or a value close to it.

However, since the options provided do not match our calculation, the best we can do is to choose the closest reasonable answer based on the context of the problem. Given the options, 126 (C) is the closest to our calculated value and might be the intended answer if there's an error in the options.

To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Large cakes: 2 per helper per hour
- Small cakes: 35 per helper per hour
- Kitchen time: 3 hours
- Needed large cakes: 20
- Needed small cakes: 700
- Number of helpers needed

Step 2: Analyze the problem:
To find out how many helpers are needed, we need to calculate the total number of cakes required and then determine how many cakes each helper can make in the given time.

First, let's find out how many large cakes can be made in 3 hours by one helper:
Large cakes per helper in 3 hours = 2 cakes/hour * 3 hours

Next, let's find out how many small cakes can be made in 3 hours by one helper:
Small cakes per helper in 3 hours = 35 cakes/hour * 3 hours

Now, we'll calculate the total number of cakes needed:
Total large cakes needed = 20
Total small cakes needed = 700

We'll check if the helpers can make enough large cakes in 3 hours:
If the helpers can make more than 20 large cakes in 3 hours, we'll subtract the 20 from the total made by one helper.

Similarly, for small cakes:
If the helpers can make more than 700 small cakes in 3 hours, we'll subtract the 700 from the total made by one helper.

Finally, we'll divide the remaining cake count by the number of cakes one helper can make in an hour (either large or small, whichever is smaller) to find out how many helpers are needed.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cakes each helper can make in 3 hours:
Large cakes per helper in 3 hours = 2 * 3 = 6 cakes
Small cakes per helper in 3 hours = 35 * 3 = 105 cakes

Step 4: Check if the helpers can make enough cakes:
- For large cakes: 6 cakes per helper is less than 20 needed, so all helpers will contribute to the large cakes.
- For small cakes: 105 cakes per helper is more than 700 needed, so we'll subtract the needed amount from the total made.

Remaining small cakes after helpers' contribution = 105 cakes - 700 cakes = -595 cakes (not possible, as we can't have a negative number of cakes)

Since the kitchen can't produce more small cakes than needed, we'll focus on the large cakes only.

Step 5: Calculate the number of helpers needed for large cakes:
Number of large cakes needed = 20
Large cakes per helper = 6
Number of helpers for large cakes = Total large cakes needed / Large cakes per helper

Number of helpers for large cakes = 20 / 6 ≈ 3.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we'll round up to the next whole number because one helper can contribute 6 cakes, and we need at least 4 helpers to make 20 cakes.

Step 6: Check if any additional helpers are needed for small cakes (assuming we have 4 helpers for large cakes):
Small cakes per helper = 105 cakes
Remaining small cakes after 4 helpers = 700 - (4 * 105) = 700 - 420 = 280 cakes

Now, we need to find out if one helper can make the remaining 280 small cakes in 3 hours:
Small cakes per helper in 3 hours = 105 cakes
Remaining cakes per helper = 280 cakes / 105 cakes/hour ≈ 2.67 hours

Since we have 3 hours available, one helper can make the remaining cakes.

Conclusion: We don't need any additional helpers for small cakes because one helper can complete the remaining 280 cakes in the given time.

So, we need 4 helpers for large cakes and 1 helper for small cakes, which adds up to 5 helpers.

The correct answer is not among the given choices. There seems to be an error in the answer choices provided, as the correct answer should be 5 helpers, not any of the options given.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 33 (C) 35 (D) 42 (E) 58
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: two numbers, ratio 3:5, after subtracting 9, ratio becomes 12:23, find the smaller number.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 
1. How can we represent the two numbers with the given ratio?
2. What is the relationship between the two numbers before the subtraction?
3. After subtracting 9 from each number, how do the new ratios relate to the original ratio?
4. How can we set up an equation to find the smaller number based on the new ratio?
5. How can we solve for the smaller number using the equation?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
1. We can represent the two numbers as \( 3x \) and \( 5x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier.
2. Before the subtraction, the relationship between the numbers is that the smaller number is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the larger number.
3. After subtracting 9 from each, the new ratios are \( \frac{3x-9}{5x-9} \) for the smaller number and \( \frac{12}{23} \) for the ratio.
4. To find the smaller number, we can equate the two ratios: \( \frac{3x-9}{5x-9} = \frac{12}{23} \).
5. We can solve this equation for \( x \) and then find the smaller number \( 3x \).

Let's solve for \( x \):

\( \frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \frac{12}{23} \)

Cross-multiply to get rid of the denominators:

\( 23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9) \)

Expand and simplify:

\( 69x - 207 = 60x - 108 \)

Subtract \( 60x \) from both sides and add 207 to both sides:

\( 9x = 99 \)

Divide by 9:

\( x = 11 \)

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the smaller number:

\( 3x = 3 \times 11 = 33 \)

The smaller number is 33, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

Question:Roberts has a property worth of $1023.65. But in a record his property worth is written as greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his property worth and it is divisible by 100. Find the difference between actual property and recorded property worth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23.65 (B) 1000 (C) 35.62 (D) 2.65 (E) 1023.65
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:property worth, $1023.65, recorded property worth, greatest positive even integer, divisible by 100, difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find the greatest positive even integer that is less than or equal to $1023.65?2. What mathematical procedure can be used to determine if a number is divisible by 100?3. Who or what entity determines the recorded property worth in this situation?4. In what context does the problem of finding the recorded property worth occur (e.g., financial records, real estate)?5. When might the recorded property worth have been documented, considering the given information?6. Why is it necessary to find the difference between the actual and recorded property worths?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the greatest positive even integer that is less than or equal to $1023.65, we need to divide the decimal by 2 and round down to the nearest whole number. Since 1023.65 is already slightly more than an even number, we simply subtract 0.65 from it, then divide by 2. 1. \( 1023.65 - 0.65 = 1023 \)2. \( 1023 \div 2 = 511.5 \)3. Rounding down, we get \( 511 \) as the greatest even integer. So, the operation performed is \( 1023 \mod 2 = 1 \), which means 1023 is not divisible by 2, and hence not by 100.To determine if a number is divisible by 100, you check if it ends in both 0s. If the last two digits of the number are 00, it is divisible by 100.For the second question, we can use the divisibility rule: if a number's last two digits form a number that is divisible by 100, the original number is divisible by 100.In the context of the problem, the recorded property worth is likely found in financial records or real estate documents. It represents the assessed value of a property for tax purposes or for transactions.The recorded property worth would have been documented at the time of the most recent assessment, which might have occurred annually or during property transactions, based on local regulations.Finally, finding the difference between the actual and recorded property worths is crucial because it helps identify any discrepancies, undervaluation, or potential tax adjustments. This comparison ensures fairness and accuracy in property taxation or valuations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A computer routine was developed to generate two numbers (x,y) the first being a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the second being less than or equal to the square root of the first. Each of the following pair satisfies the routine except
 Answer Choices: (A)  (99,10)  (B)  (85,9)  (C)  (50,7)  (D)  (1,1)  (E)  (1,0)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question
- We're looking for a 5-digit number.
- The property is that adding a 1 to the end of the number multiplies its value by 3.

Step 2: Set up the equation based on the property
Let's denote the 5-digit number as \( N \). According to the property, we can write:
\[ N \times 10 + 1 = 3 \times (N \times 1) \]

Step 3: Simplify the equation
\[ N \times 10 + 1 = 3N \]

Step 4: Solve for \( N \)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( N \):
\[ N \times (10 - 3) = 1 \]
\[ N \times 7 = 1 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to find \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{1}{7} \]

Step 5: Check if the result makes sense for a 5-digit number
Since \( N \) is a fraction, it cannot be a 5-digit number. However, we can interpret this as the repeating decimal representation of the fraction, which would be a non-terminating decimal. 

Step 6: Express the number as a mixed number or a repeating decimal
The fraction \( \frac{1}{7} \) can be expressed as a mixed number or a decimal. Since it's a simple fraction, it's easy to convert:
\[ N = 0.\overline{142857} \]

This number is a repeating decimal with the digits 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, and 7 repeating indefinitely.

Step 7: Conclusion
Although the number itself is not a 5-digit integer, the property described does apply to the repeating decimal representation of \( \frac{1}{7} \). The closest 5-digit approximation would be the first five digits of the repeating sequence, which is 14285.

Answer: The 5-digit number that fits the description is \( 14285.\overline{142857} \), but it's important to note that this is not a whole number but a repeating decimal.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: two-digit number, sum of digits, exceeds by 18, digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we represent a two-digit number in terms of its digits? Let's call the tens digit x and the units digit y.
2. What is the formula for the sum of the digits of a two-digit number? It would be x + y.
3. Given that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, we can form an equation: 10x + y = (x + y) + 18.
4. Since the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, we have y = 2x.
5. Can we substitute y from the fourth point into the third point to find the values of x and y?
6. Once we have x and y, which represent the digits of the number, we can write the actual number by combining them (10x + y).
7. Which of the answer choices (A, B, C, D, or E) corresponds to the two-digit number found in step 6?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. A two-digit number can be represented as 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit.
2. The sum of the digits is x + y.
3. Plugging in the relationship from step 2 into the equation from step 3, we get: 10x + y = x + y + 18.
4. Substituting y = 2x into the equation: 10x + 2x = x + 2x + 18.
5. Simplifying the equation: 12x = 18.
6. Solving for x: x = 18 / 12 = 1.5 (which is not possible since x must be an integer).
7. However, since x is the tens digit and must be an integer, we made an error in our calculation. Let's try again by plugging y = 2x back into the equation and checking the options.

Step 4: Retrying the calculation with y = 2x:
12x = x + 2x + 18
12x = 3x + 18
9x = 18
x = 2

Now that we have x, we can find y:
y = 2 * x = 2 * 2 = 4

The two-digit number is 24.

Step 5: Conclusion:
The correct answer is (B) 24.

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:conference, team, 4 men, 4 women, presenters, chosen, different groups, composed of men only, women only, different if at least one presenter is different..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without restrictions?2. What is the formula for finding the number of combinations when selecting a certain number of items from a larger group, considering order does not matter?3. Who are the individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference?4. Where does the constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" apply in this problem?5. When is this constraint relevant - during the selection of presenters or after they have been chosen?6. Why is it important to consider the exclusion of teams with all men or all women in the selection process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without any restrictions, you would use the concept of permutations if order mattered or combinations if order was not significant. Since order doesn't seem to matter here, we'll use combinations. The formula for combinations (denoted as C(n, k)) is:C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)where n is the total number of individuals available and k is the number of presenters to choose.The individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference are all men and all women, regardless of gender. The constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" applies to the selection process itself.This constraint is relevant during the selection stage, as it prevents the formation of homogeneous teams. It ensures diversity in the composition of the presenting team. By excluding these specific combinations, the pool of potential presenters broadens, allowing for balanced teams with both men and women.Considering this exclusion is important because it reflects the desired balance and inclusivity in the conference's representation. If teams with all men or all women were allowed, it would violate the goal of having a diverse lineup of presenters. Therefore, the exclusion rule must be applied during the selection process to guarantee an appropriate mix of presenters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 64 boys, 40 girls, membership drive, ratio of boys to girls, 4:3, new total number of members.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many boys joined the group during the membership drive if the ratio of boys to girls remains 4:3?
2. How many girls joined the group during the membership drive if the ratio of boys to girls remains 4:3?
3. What is the common number of boys and girls who joined the group?
4. How many boys will there be after the membership drive?
5. How many girls will there be after the membership drive?
6. What is the total number of members after the membership drive, considering the updated ratio of boys to girls?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. Since the ratio of boys to girls remains 4:3, for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. Let's denote the common number of boys and girls joining as x. So, we have:
   \( 64 + x \) boys and \( 40 + x \) girls.

2. To maintain the 4:3 ratio, we can set up the equation:
   \( \frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3} \)

3. Solving for x, we get:
   \( 3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x) \)
   \( 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x \)
   \( x = 192 - 160 \)
   \( x = 32 \)

4. After the membership drive, there will be \( 64 + 32 = 96 \) boys.

5. And there will be \( 40 + 32 = 72 \) girls.

6. Now, we can find the total number of members after the membership drive by adding the number of boys and girls together:
   \( 96 \) boys + \( 72 \) girls = \( 168 \) members.

Step 4: The answer is E, 168 members.

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: arranging 3 children (Susan, Tim, Zen) on 3 identical chairs, Susan on the left of Tim.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many arrangements are possible for Susan, Tim, and Zen without any restrictions?2. How many of those arrangements have Susan to the left of Tim?3. Since the chairs are identical, does the order matter or are they considered the same arrangement?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- For 3 children (A, B, and C), the total number of arrangements without restrictions can be found using the factorial of the number of children (3!).
- The restriction that Susan must be to the left of Tim means we need to consider the arrangement as ABT or BAT, where A is Susan, B is Tim, and T is Zen. There are only two ways to arrange these letters with this constraint.
- Since the chairs are identical, the arrangement ABT and BAT are considered the same, so we only count one of them.

So, the answer is 2 arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim.

Question:There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election?
 Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:a 90% chance, registered voter, Burghtown, last election, five registered voters, randomly chosen, exactly four, likelihood.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting in the last election, given a 90% chance?2. What is the probability of a single randomly chosen registered voter from Burghtown not voting in the last election, if 90% did vote?3. Who are the subjects of interest in this problem - the voters or the selection of five voters? 4. In which town does this scenario take place - Burghtown?5. When is the event being discussed - the last election?6. Why is it important to find the likelihood of exactly four out of five voters voting - for statistical analysis or prediction purposes?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of a statistical analysis and prediction exercise, the last election held in the town of Burghtown serves as the focal point. Given that 90% of the registered voters participated in the election, we can apply the binomial probability formula to determine the probability of specific outcomes. To calculate the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting, we use the formula:P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)where:- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (voters voting) out of n trials (voters),- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also known as "n choose k"),- n = 5 (since there are five voters),- k = 4 (we want to find the probability of four voting),- p = 0.9 (90% chance of a voter voting).Plugging in the values, we get:P(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.9^4 * (1-0.9)^(5-4)P(X = 4) = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1P(X = 4) ≈ 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1P(X = 4) ≈ 0.32805So, the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting is approximately 32.81%.Conversely, to find the probability of a single randomly chosen registered voter not voting, given that 90% voted, we subtract the probability of voting from 1:P(Voter doesn't vote) = 1 - P(Voter votes) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1This means the probability of a single voter not voting is 10%.The subjects of interest in this problem are the voters themselves, as we are calculating probabilities based on their voting behavior. The scenario takes place in the town of Burghtown during the last election. The importance of finding the likelihood of exactly four out of five voters voting lies in understanding the distribution of voter turnout, which can be crucial for statistical analysis and making predictions about future elections.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Calculate the number of eligible voters.
Given that 20% of the 5,000 voters are not eligible, we can find the number of eligible voters by subtracting 20% from 100% of the total.

Number of eligible voters = Total voters - (20% of total voters)
Number of eligible voters = 5,000 - (0.20 * 5,000)

Step 2: Calculate the number of eligible voters.
Number of eligible voters = 5,000 - 1,000
Number of eligible voters = 4,000

Step 3: Calculate the number of votes the winning candidate received.
Since the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, we can find the number of votes he received by taking 15% of the eligible voters.

Votes for winning candidate = (15% of eligible voters)
Votes for winning candidate = 0.15 * 4,000

Step 4: Calculate the actual number of votes.
Votes for winning candidate = 0.15 * 4,000
Votes for winning candidate = 600

However, since the answer choices are not whole numbers, we might have made an error in our calculations. Let's double-check the calculations.

Votes for winning candidate = 0.15 * 4,000
Votes for winning candidate = 600

This matches the closest answer choice, which is (A) 3267. It seems there might be an error in the answer choices, as 600 votes is not among them. If the question is correct, and the winning candidate received exactly 600 votes, then the answer should be (A) 3267. However, without more context or corrected answer choices, we cannot provide a definitive answer.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2.

Question:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12? Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 15 (C) 17 (D) 5 (E) 7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: multiple of X, divisible by 9, divisible by 12.
Step 2: New questions to address:
- What does it mean for a number to be a multiple of X?
- What does it mean for a number to be divisible by 9 and 12?
- How can we determine if a number is a multiple of both 9 and 12, given that 9 and 12 have a common factor?

Step 3: Explanation of the concepts:
- A multiple of X is any number that can be expressed as X multiplied by an integer (positive, negative, or zero).
- A number is divisible by another if it can be divided without leaving a remainder. For example, if a number is divisible by 9 and 12, it means it can be expressed as 9k and 12m for some integers k and m.

Step 4: Combining the concepts:
Since 9 and 12 are both divisible by 3 (9 = 3 * 3 and 12 = 3 * 4), any number that is divisible by both 9 and 12 must also be divisible by 3 (because if a number is divisible by both 3 and 3, it's divisible by 3^2 = 9, and if it's divisible by both 3 and 4, it's divisible by their least common multiple, which is 3 * 4 = 12).

Step 5: Applying this to the answer choices:
- (A) 36 is divisible by 9 (36/9 = 4) and 12 (36/12 = 3), so it's a multiple of both 9 and 12.
- (B) 15 is divisible by 3 (15/3 = 5), but not by 12 (15/12 = 1.25, not an integer).
- (C) 17 is not divisible by 9 or 12.
- (D) 5 is not divisible by 9 or 12.
- (E) 7 is not divisible by 9 or 12.

Conclusion: Among the given choices, only (A) 36 is a multiple of X, as it is divisible by both 9 and 12.

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.
- Three consecutive integers
- Their product is 727 + 728 + 729

Step 2: Analyze the product.
- The sum of the three numbers given (727 + 728 + 729) is a consecutive sequence of integers as well, specifically 2184.

Step 3: Consider the properties of consecutive integers.
- If we have three consecutive integers, their product can be expressed as (n) * (n + 1) * (n + 2), where n is the first integer in the sequence.

Step 4: Relate the product to the given sum.
- Since the sum of the three numbers is 2184, we can set up the equation:
   (n) * (n + 1) * (n + 2) = 2184

Step 5: Solve for n.
- We need to find three consecutive integers whose product equals 2184. Let's try to factorize 2184 to see if it can be expressed as a product of three consecutive integers.
   2184 = 2^3 * 3 * 7 * 13
   The prime factors suggest that we can express 2184 as a product of three consecutive integers if we group them as follows:
   2^3 * 3 * 7 = (2 * 3 * 7) * (2 * 7) * (2 * 3)
   This gives us (6) * (14) * (6), which are indeed three consecutive integers: 6, 7, and 8.

Step 6: Calculate the sum of the three integers.
- Sum = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21

Step 7: Compare the calculated sum with the answer choices.
- The sum we found (21) corresponds to option (C) 36, which is not among the given choices. However, since there seems to be a discrepancy in the question, it could be that the answer choices are incorrect or there's a typo in the problem statement.

Without more context or clarification, it's difficult to determine the correct answer. If the intended sum is indeed 21, then the correct answer would be (C) 36. If the question refers to the sum of the integers that multiply to give 727, 728, and 729, then the answer would be (E) 39 (since 27 * 28 * 29 = 2184, and the sum of 27, 28, and 29 is 39).

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:students, school, more than 501, 20% physics, 28% math, least possible number of students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation can we perform to find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math if we know the percentages of students taking each subject?2. What: How can we combine the given percentages of students taking physics (20%) and math (28%) to find the maximum overlap without exceeding the total count of more than 501 students?3. Who: In this context, what entity is responsible for ensuring that the least possible number of students are accounted for twice (once in physics and once in math)?4. Where: The problem is set in a school, so how does this context affect the calculation of the least possible number of students?5. When: Is there a specific constraint related to the timeframe in which the school's student population could be determined? If not, why does it not matter in this case?6. Why: Why is finding the least possible number of students important in this situation? Does it relate to budgeting, class sizes, or another relevant factor?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario at a school, the mathematics department and physics department conducted a survey to determine student enrollment. To find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math, we need to perform a mathematical operation known as set intersection. By subtracting the percentage of students taking only one subject from the total, we can estimate the overlap. First, let's calculate the percentage of students taking either physics or math or both. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, we add these two percentages together (20% + 28% = 48%). However, since the total number of students cannot exceed 501, the overlap cannot account for more than this number. To avoid double-counting, we must subtract the sum of the percentages from 100% (the entire student population) and then find the intersection within the remaining 52% (100% - 48%).Now, let's assume that the overlap represents the least possible number of students taking both subjects. This implies that these students would not be counted twice in the physics and math counts. Therefore, the school administration, responsible for maintaining accurate records, is the entity ensuring this consistency.The context of the problem being set in a school affects the calculation because it provides the real-world setting where such enrollment data is typically gathered. However, there is no specific timeframe mentioned, and the calculation does not rely on a particular date, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.The importance of finding the least possible number of students taking both subjects lies in efficient resource allocation and planning. It ensures that when allocating budgets for resources like classrooms, instructors, or materials, the school does not overestimate the demand for combined courses, thereby making the allocation more precise and cost-effective.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: students, class, math, bio, English, total number, 4-digit number, difference between maximum and minimum.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we find the total number of students if we know the fractions of students studying each subject? We need to find a common denominator for the fractions (16, 10, and 8) and then express the total as a multiple of this common denominator.
2. What is the range of possible values for the total number of students if it's a 4-digit number? Since the total must be a whole number and a multiple of the common denominator, we need to find the smallest and largest possible values within the 4-digit range.
3. How do we calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum possible student counts? We'll subtract the minimum from the maximum after finding both.

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. To find the total number of students, we can convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a common denominator, say LCM(16, 10, 8). The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80. Now, we have:
   - Math students: (1/16) * 5 = 5/80
   - Bio students: (1/10) * 8 = 8/80
   - English students: (1/8) * 10 = 10/80
   The total number of students studying these subjects is 5 + 8 + 10 = 23/80 of the total students. Since the total number must be an integer, we can multiply the denominator by an integer to get a whole number. The smallest such integer is 80, so the total number of students is 23 * 80 = 1840.

2. The range of possible values for the total number of students is from 1000 to 9999 (since it's a 4-digit number). The minimum number of students is 1000, and the maximum is 9999.

3. To find the difference between the maximum and minimum, we subtract the minimum from the maximum: 9999 - 1000 = 8999.

However, the answer choices do not include 8999. There might be an error in the answer choices provided. Given the calculations, the correct answer should be 8999.

Therefore, there seems to be an issue with the answer choices, and the correct answer cannot be determined based on the information provided.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1000p (B) 1500p (C) 2000p (D) 2500p (E) 30000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:phone manufacturer, crates, pallets, each pallet, phones, 4 crates.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of phones per crate?2. How many phones does one pallet hold?3. What is the relationship between the number of pallets and the number of phones in a crate?4. How many phones are there in 4 crates if each crate has the same number of pallets?5. Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Five dozen toys are packed in a box and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round ? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question - Five dozen toys, one box, 98 boxes, tempo, 29400 toys, lifting in one round.
Step 2: Decompose the question into smaller parts:
- How many toys are in one dozen? 
- How many toys are in one box?
- How many toys are in 98 boxes?
- How many toys does one tempo lift in one round?
- How many tempos are needed to lift 29400 toys?

Step 3: Calculate the number of toys in one dozen and one box:
- One dozen is equal to 12 toys because there are 12 in a dozen.
- Five dozen toys would be 5 * 12 = 60 toys.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of toys in 98 boxes:
- Since one box contains 60 toys, 98 boxes would contain 98 * 60 = 5880 toys.

Step 5: Determine how many toys one tempo lifts in one round:
- The question doesn't specify how many toys one tempo can lift, but since we need to find the number of tempos, we can assume that each tempo can lift the same amount as the total number of toys in 98 boxes (5880 toys).

Step 6: Calculate the number of tempos needed to lift 29400 toys:
- To find out how many tempos are required to lift 29400 toys, we divide the total number of toys needed (29400) by the number of toys one tempo can lift (5880).
- 29400 / 5880 = 5 tempos.

Answer: Since we rounded down in our calculations, the actual number of tempos needed might be slightly less than 5. However, since the answer choices are whole numbers and the closest whole number to 5 that fits the given context is 5, the correct answer is (B) 5.

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Step 1: Key elements of the question: Raj's age, age difference, past age, current age of Raj, current age of Rahim.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How do we find Raj's age 5 years ago?
2. How do we find the relationship between Raj's and Rahim's ages based on the given information?
3. If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago, what was Raj's age then?

- At that time, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim, so Rahim was 12 * 3 = 36 years old 5 years ago.

Step 4: Calculate Rahim's current age:
- To find Rahim's current age, we add 5 years to his age 5 years ago: 36 + 5 = 41 years old.

Step 5: Match the calculated age with the answer choices:
The correct answer choice is (B) 41.

Question:Let A and B be independent events with P (A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B)?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.2 (B) 0.4 (C) 0.6 (D) 1.2 (E) 1.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, independent events, P(A), P(B), P(A/B).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the conditional probability P(A|B) given that A and B are independent events?2. What is the formula for calculating the probability of an event A occurring given that event B has already occurred, if A and B are independent?3. Who or what determines that P(A/B) can be found using the relationship between independent events?4. In what context would you apply the probabilities P(A) and P(B) when finding P(A|B) for independent events?5. When working with independent events like A and B, why is the probability of both events happening together equal to the product of their individual probabilities?6. How do you compute P(A|B) when given P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8, knowing that they are independent?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In probability theory, when dealing with the conditional probability of an event A occurring given that another event B has occurred, the appropriate operation to use is Bayes' theorem. However, for independent events A and B, a simpler approach applies. The formula for calculating P(A|B) when A and B are independent is based on the fact that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. The conditional probability P(A|B) can be found using the following formula:\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]Here, P(A ∩ B) represents the probability of both events happening together, which, for independent events, is equal to the product of their individual probabilities:\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]Since A and B are independent, we know that:\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(B)} \]\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]Now, let's consider the specific case where P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. For independent events, we directly substitute these values into the simplified formula:\[ P(A|B) = 0.2 \]So, when given the probabilities of two independent events, the conditional probability P(A|B) can be computed by multiplying their individual probabilities without any further calculations, as the dependency between them is null. This concept is useful in various contexts, such as statistics, gambling, or decision-making scenarios where the likelihood of one event does not influence the likelihood of another.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 0.6 (C) 0.7 (D) 0.8 (E) 0.9
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:events A and B, independent, probability that event A occurs, 0.6, probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs, 0.96, probability that event B occurs.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the probability of event B occurring given that A and B are independent?2. What is the relationship between the probabilities of A and B when they are independent?3. Who or what determines the probability of at least one of A or B happening?4. In which context does the independence of events A and B play a role in calculating the probability of B?5. When calculating the probability of B, what information about A's occurrence is already known?6. How can we use the given probabilities (0.6 and 0.96) to find the probability of B occurring?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:When dealing with probabilities, the concept of independence is crucial for understanding certain calculations. Given two events, A and B, if they are independent, this means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring. To find the probability of event B happening specifically when A has occurred and they are independent, we use the multiplication rule of probability. The formula for this is P(B|A) = P(B), where P(B|A) represents the conditional probability of B given A, and P(B) is the probability of B alone.The relationship between the probabilities of A and B when they are independent is that their joint probability, P(A ∩ B), equals the product of their individual probabilities, P(A) * P(B). This is expressed as P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) / P(A).The probability of at least one of A or B happening, denoted as P(A ∪ B), is determined by adding the probabilities of A and B, minus their intersection (since they cannot both happen at the same time): P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).Independence of events A and B plays a role in calculating the probability of B in situations where we want to know the likelihood of B occurring without considering the occurrence of A. If A and B are independent, we can directly use P(B) to find the probability of B.In the context of calculating the probability of B, if we know that A and B are independent, and we have the probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can simply use P(B) to find the probability of B without needing any additional information about A's occurrence.To find the probability of B using the given probabilities of 0.6 for A and 0.96 for B, since they are independent, we can directly apply P(B) = 0.96, as the occurrence of A does not affect B's probability. Therefore, the probability of B occurring is 0.96.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question
- Two numbers are relatively prime if they have no common positive factors other than 1.
- Set S contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive.
- Probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions
1. What is the definition of relatively prime?
2. How can we determine if two numbers are relatively prime?
3. What is the probability of a randomly chosen integer being relatively prime to a given number?
4. How can we calculate the probability that a number chosen from 1 to 1,000 is relatively prime to 1,000?
5. What is the relationship between the factors of a number and its relatively prime numbers?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions
1. Relatively prime means that the only common factor between the two numbers is 1. For example, 7 and 23 are relatively prime because their only common factor is 1.
2. To check if two numbers are relatively prime, we need to find their greatest common divisor (GCD). If the GCD is 1, they are relatively prime.
3. The probability of a randomly chosen integer being relatively prime to a given number depends on how many integers are relatively prime to that number within the given range.
4. To calculate this probability, we need to count the number of integers in the range [1, 1000] that are relatively prime to 1000 and divide that by the total number of integers in the range.
5. The probability will be higher if there are more numbers with relatively few factors, as those are more likely to be relatively prime to 1000.

Step 4: Apply the concepts to solve the problem
We can use the fact that 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3. To find the number of integers relatively prime to 1000, we need to consider the prime factors of the integers in the range. Since we're looking for integers with no common factors other than 1 with 1000, we need to exclude those that have a factor of 2 or 5.

- Numbers divisible by 2: There are 500 numbers (from 2 to 1000) divisible by 2.
- Numbers divisible by 5: There are 200 numbers (from 5 to 1000) divisible by 5.
- Numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 10): There are 100 numbers (from 10 to 1000) divisible by 10.

However, we also need to account for numbers divisible by 2^2, 5^2, and 2^2 * 5^2 (i.e., multiples of 4, 25, and 100, respectively). These numbers are:
- 2^2: 250 numbers (from 4 to 1000)
- 5^2: 100 numbers (from 25 to 1000)
- 2^2 * 5^2: 50 numbers (from 100 to 1000)

Now, we subtract these counts from the total count of numbers divisible by 2, 5, or both:
- Total divisible by 2 or 5: 500 + 200 - 100 - 250 - 100 + 50 = 100
- Total divisible by 2^2, 5^2, or both: 250 + 100 - 50 = 200

There are 800 numbers left that are not divisible by 2, 5, 2^2, 5^2, or both, which means they are relatively prime to 1000.

Step 5: Calculate the probability
Probability of choosing a relatively prime number = Number of relatively prime numbers / Total number of integers in the range
Probability = 800 / 1000 = 4/5

The answer choices don't match this exact value, but the closest option is C) 4/7, which is equivalent to 800/1400 when simplified. This is not the correct answer, so there seems to be an error in the answer choices provided. The correct probability should be 4/5, which corresponds to none of the options given.

For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: consecutive two-digit odd numbers, sum, divided by 10, perfect square.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What are the characteristics of consecutive two-digit odd numbers?
2. How can we express the sum of five consecutive odd numbers algebraically?
3. What conditions must be met for the sum to become a perfect square when divided by 10?
4. Which of the given options meet the criteria for being part of a set of five consecutive odd numbers that satisfy the perfect square condition?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. Consecutive two-digit odd numbers are numbers like 11, 13, 15, ..., where each number is two more than the previous one.
2. Let's denote the first number in the sequence as \( n \). Then, the sequence would be \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \). The sum of these five numbers can be expressed as \( 5n + 20 \).
3. For the sum to be a perfect square when divided by 10, we need \( \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5n}{10} + 2 \) to be a perfect square. Since \( \frac{5n}{10} \) is half of an odd number (since \( n \) is odd), it will always be an integer. So, \( 2 \) needs to be added to an integer to make it a perfect square. This implies that \( 2 \) should be a difference of two consecutive perfect squares.
4. We need to check which of the given options (A) 47, (B) 91, (C) 41, (D) 67, and (E) 44 can be the first number in a sequence that results in a perfect square sum after dividing by 10.

Step 4: Test each option:
- (A) 47: Sum = \( 5 \times 47 + 20 = 235 + 20 = 255 \). Dividing by 10 gives \( 25.5 \), which is not a perfect square.
- (B) 91: Sum = \( 5 \times 91 + 20 = 455 + 20 = 475 \). Dividing by 10 gives \( 47.5 \), which is not a perfect square.
- (C) 41: Sum = \( 5 \times 41 + 20 = 205 + 20 = 225 \). Dividing by 10 gives \( 22.5 \), which is not a perfect square.
- (D) 67: Sum = \( 5 \times 67 + 20 = 335 + 20 = 355 \). Dividing by 10 gives \( 35.5 \), which is not a perfect square.
- (E) 44: Sum = \( 5 \times 44 + 20 = 220 + 20 = 240 \). Dividing by 10 gives \( 24 \), which is a perfect square (15^2).

Step 5: Conclusion:
The only option that results in a perfect square sum when divided by 10 is (E) 44, because \( 24 = 15^2 \). Therefore, 44 can be one of the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers that satisfy the given conditions.

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 60 (C) 70 (D) 80 (E) 90
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Ajay's present age, 6 years subtracted, remainder divided by 18, Rahul's age, Rahul 2 years younger than Denis, Denis's age.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What operation is needed to find the relationship between Ajay's age and Rahul's age? 
2. How do we find the remainder when Ajay's age is reduced by 6 and then divided by 18?
3. What is the relationship between Rahul's age and Denis's age?
4. How can we use this information to find Ajay's age?

Step 3: Analyze the relationships:
- We know that after subtracting 6 from Ajay's age and dividing the result by 18, we get Rahul's age. This suggests that there is a multiple of 18 between Ajay's age and Rahul's age, with a difference of 6.
- Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old. So, Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years.

Step 4: Apply the relationships to find Ajay's age:
- Since the remainder when Ajay's age is divided by 18 equals Rahul's age (3 years), Ajay's age must be 18n + 3 (where n is a non-negative integer).
- Since Ajay's age is also 6 years more than some multiple of 18, we can write it as 18m + 6 (where m is another non-negative integer).
- Combining these two expressions, we have 18m + 6 = 18n + 3.
- Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us 18m + 3 = 18n.
- This implies that m = n.

Step 5: Find the smallest value of m (and thus n) that satisfies the equation:
- If m = n, then Ajay's age (18m + 6) must be a multiple of 18 plus 6. The smallest such value is when m = 1, which gives us Ajay's age as 18 * 1 + 6 = 24.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. The question asks for Ajay's age, and since we've found a possible value (24), we need to check if any of the answer choices are a multiple of 18 plus 6.

Step 6: Check the answer choices:
- If Ajay's age is 24, and we add 6, we get 30, which is not in the list.
- Adding 6 to the next multiple of 18 (36) gives us 42, which is still not in the list.
- Continuing this pattern, we see that none of the answer choices (40, 60, 70, 80, or 90) can be obtained by adding 6 to a multiple of 18.

Conclusion: The given information does not lead to a unique solution for Ajay's age within the provided answer choices. Therefore, the correct answer is "Cannot be determined" (option D).

Input:
Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

(2/3) * x - 10 = 40 + (1/3) * x

Here, x represents the unknown number.

Step 3: Simplify the equation:
(2/3)x - (1/3)x = 40 + 10

Combine like terms:
(2/3 - 1/3)x = 50

This simplifies to:
(1/3)x = 50

Step 4: Solve for x:
To isolate x, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 1/3, which is 3:
3 * (1/3)x = 50 * 3

This gives us:
x = 150

Step 5: Match the solution with the answer choices:
The number x is 150, which corresponds to answer choice (C).

Input:
Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In how many ways can the letters of the word "PROBLEC" be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2! (B) 3! (C) 7! (D) 8! (E) 9!
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the letters of the word "PROBLEC", rearranged, 7 letter words, none of the letters repeat.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of arrangements possible when all the letters of a word are considered without repetition?2. What is the factorial notation used to calculate the number of permutations when arranging a set of distinct elements, like the letters in "PROBLEC"?3. In the context of the word "PROBLEC," how many unique letters does it have that can be rearranged to form 7-letter words?4. How does the concept of factorial apply to determining the number of ways the letters in "PROBLEC" can be arranged to create 7-letter words with no repeats?5. Who would typically perform this calculation, a mathematician, a computer programmer, or someone solving a puzzle?6. Where might you encounter this type of problem, in combinatorics, probability, or a word game like Scrabble?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the realm of combinatorics, the operation that represents the total number of arrangements possible when all the letters of a word are considered without repetition is known as permutations. This is calculated using the factorial notation, which is denoted by an exclamation mark (!). For instance, to find the permutations of the distinct elements in the word "PROBLEC," we would use the formula n! where n is the number of elements. In the case of "PROBLEC," there are 7 unique letters (P, R, O, B, L, E, and C), so the factorial for 7 letters, 7!, would give us the number of permutations.When arranging the letters in "PROBLEC" to form 7-letter words with no repeats, the factorial calculation comes into play. The number of permutations would be 7! because each letter can be placed in any of the 7 positions without repetition. To find the exact number, we multiply 7 by 6 by 5 by 4 by 3 by 2 by 1, which equals 5,040.This type of calculation is commonly performed by mathematicians and computer programmers who need to determine the combinations or permutations in various scenarios, such as data analysis, cryptography, or even in word games like Scrabble, where players need to know how many unique words they can make with a given set of letters. In essence, understanding factorials is crucial for tackling problems in combinatorics and probability.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: number, greater than 36, less than 86.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What does it mean for a number to be "as much greater than 36 as is less than 86"?2. How can we express this relationship mathematically?3. What is the number that satisfies this condition?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions, we can infer that the number should be equidistant from both 36 and 86. In other words, it should be half-way between these two numbers.

To find the number, we can take the average of 36 and 86:
\[ \text{Number} = \frac{36 + 86}{2} \]

Now let's calculate the value:
\[ \text{Number} = \frac{122}{2} \]
\[ \text{Number} = 61 \]

The number that satisfies the given condition is 61.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 61.

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:What is the units digit of 9^3-7? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 3 (C) 5 (D) 2 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: units digit, 9^3, 7, subtraction.
Step 2: Identify the pattern: To find the units digit of a power of 9, we only need to look at the last digit of each power because the powers will repeat in a cycle. The cycle for the units digits of powers of 9 is: 9, 1, 9, 1, ... (Every two powers, the cycle repeats).
Step 3: Calculate the units digit of 9^3: Since the cycle is every two powers, we can quickly determine that the units digit of 9^3 will be the same as the units digit of 9^1, which is 9.
Step 4: Subtract 7 from the result: Now we need to subtract 7 from 9. When subtracting 7 from 9, we get 2 (9 - 7 = 2).
Step 5: Determine the units digit of the subtraction: Since we're looking for the units digit, we only care about the last digit of the result, which is 2.
Step 6: Match the units digit to the answer choices: The units digit of 9^3 - 7 is 2.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Decipher the following multiplication table:
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Since there is no actual multiplication table provided in the question, I'll assume you're asking for guidance on how to interpret or create a multiplication table. Here's a general approach to deciphering or creating one:

1. **Understand the format**: A multiplication table typically consists of a grid with rows and columns labeled with numbers starting from 1 and going up to a specified limit (usually the square root of the larger number, if it's a small one). Each cell contains the product of the row number and the column number.

2. **Example for a 4x4 table**:
   ```
   1   2   3   4
   2   4   6   8
   3   6   9  12
   4   8  12  16
   ```
   In this table, the top row is 1, the first column is also 1, and the cell in the first row and first column represents the product of 1 and 1, which is 1.

3. **Reading the table**: To find the product of two numbers, locate the row corresponding to the first number and the column corresponding to the second number. The intersection of the row and column gives the product.

4. **Creating a multiplication table**: If you want to create one, you'd start by writing the numbers across the top and down the side. Then, multiply each row number by the column number and fill in the cells accordingly.

5. **Assuming you meant to create a table**: If you wanted me to create a specific table, please provide the range of numbers you'd like to see in the table, and I can help you construct it.

If you meant something else entirely, please clarify your request for the multiplication table.

Question:Suppose you want to arrange your English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography and Science books on a shelf. In how many ways can you do it ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 520 (B) 720 (C) 920 (D) None (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:arrange, English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, Science books, shelf, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of arrangements in this problem?2. How many distinct books are there that need to be arranged?3. In how many ways can you arrange the first book (e.g., English)?4. Given that the second book can be any of the remaining, how many choices do you have for placing the Hindi book?5. What is the general term for the number of permutations when arranging n items without regard to order?6. Can you determine the answer without knowing the exact number of ways for each book's position? If not, why not?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of arrangements in the given problem, we can apply the concept of permutations, which is a mathematical operation used to determine the number of ways n items can be arranged. Let's denote the number of distinct books as B.1. The operation used for this calculation is permutation, represented by the formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where "!" denotes factorial, which means multiplying all positive integers up to that number.2. There are B distinct books that need to be arranged.3. For the first book, since it has no restrictions, there are B choices for its position.4. Once the first book is placed, there are (B-1) choices left for the second book, as it can be any of the remaining books.5. The general term for the number of permutations when arranging n items without regard to order is indeed P(n, n) = n!, as each item can go in any of the n positions.6. Yes, we can determine the answer without knowing the exact number of ways for each book's position because the final result will only depend on the total number of distinct books (B). We can multiply the number of choices for the first book by the number of choices for the second book, and so on, until all books are accounted for, resulting in B * (B-1) * ... * 1, which simplifies to B!.Therefore, the passage describing the calculations would be:To find the total number of arrangements, we apply the permutation formula P(B, B) = B! where B is the number of distinct books. First, there are B choices for placing the first book. Since the second book can be any of the remaining (B-1) books, we multiply these choices together: B * (B-1). This gives us the total number of distinct arrangements, which simplifies to B! arrangements when considering all books without regard to their specific order.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 18 (D) 20 (E) 30
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: bookshelf, 45 books, hardcover, fiction, maximum number, intersection.
Step 2: Identify the relevant information: We are looking for the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, which means we need to find the overlap between the two categories.
Step 3: Analyze the problem: Since there are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction would be the minimum of these two quantities, because a book cannot be both hardcover and fiction if it's not in each category.
Step 4: Compare the numbers: 30 (hardcover) is greater than 20 (fiction), so the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20, because 20 is the number of fiction books, which is the smaller number.
Step 5: Choose the correct answer: The maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 20.

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
 Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:IPL season, Sachin, current batting average, 51, finals, scores 78 runs, batting average, 54, total number of matches played..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out Sachin's new batting average after scoring 78 runs?2. What is the formula for calculating a player's batting average if we know their initial average and the number of runs scored?3. Who is the subject of the batting average calculation in this scenario (Sachin)?4. Where does the change in batting average occur - in the IPL season or specifically during the finals?5. When does the change in batting average happen - after scoring 78 runs or at the end of the season?6. How many matches did Sachin play before the finals to have a current average of 51 runs?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of Sachin's cricketing journey, his batting average is a crucial statistic that reflects his performance. To determine his new average after scoring an impressive 78 runs, we can use the batting average formula. The formula is:\[ \text{New Average} = \frac{\text{Initial Average} \times \text{Matches Played} + \text{Runs Scored}}{\text{Matches Played} + 1} \]Let's assume Sachin had a current average of 51 runs before the additional match. If he played \( M \) matches prior to the finals, the calculation would look like this:\[ \text{Initial Average} = 51 \]\[ \text{Runs Scored} = 78 \]\[ \text{Matches Played Before Finals} = M \]After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new average \( \text{NewAvg} \) would be:\[ \text{NewAvg} = \frac{51M + 78}{M + 1} \]The specific change in batting average occurs during the finals, as it's after scoring those 78 runs. To find out how many matches \( M \) Sachin played before the finals to have a current average of 51, we would need to know the total runs scored before the finals. Unfortunately, without this information, we cannot directly calculate \( M \). However, once we have \( M \), we can plug it into the formula above to find his new average.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 25 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 21
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Sachin's age, Ajay's age, past relationship (twice as old), time frame (10 years back), future relationship (Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years), current age of Ajay.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we find the relationship between Sachin's and Ajay's ages 10 years ago?
2. If Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, what is his current age?
3. Using the information from steps 1 and 2, how old was Ajay 10 years ago?
4. How do we find Ajay's current age based on his age 10 years ago?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. Since Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago, we can write this as: \( \text{Sachin's Age 10 years ago} = 2 \times \text{Ajay's Age 10 years ago} \).
2. Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so his current age is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) years.
3. To find Ajay's age 10 years ago, we divide Sachin's age by 2: \( \text{Ajay's Age 10 years ago} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) years.
4. To find Ajay's current age, we add 10 years to his age 10 years ago: \( \text{Ajay's Current Age} = 15 + 10 = 25 \) years.

Step 4: Answer the original question with the calculated value:
Answer: Ajay is currently 25 years old. So the correct choice is (B) 25.

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:My wall contains 8 red colour ties, 13 violet colour ties,10 blue colour ties, 5 pink colour ties, 4 green colour ties. If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: wall, ties, at least two ties of the same color, minimum number to remove.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many ties are there in total?
2. If we want to have at least two ties of the same color, what is the minimum number of colors we need to have to guarantee this?
3. How many ties of each color are there?
4. How many ties of the most common color do we need to remove to ensure at least two ties of the same color remain even if electricity is gone?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. The total number of ties is the sum of all tie colors: 8 red + 13 violet + 10 blue + 5 pink + 4 green.
2. To have at least two ties of the same color, we need to consider the worst-case scenario, which is having ties from all colors except one. So, we need to have ties from 4 colors (red, violet, blue, and pink) to ensure at least two ties of one color.
3. The most common color is the one with the highest count, which is violet with 13 ties.
4. We need to remove ties from the most common color until we have ties from at least three colors. Since we already have ties from red, blue, and pink, we only need to remove enough violet ties to ensure there are at least two ties of another color.

Now, let's calculate the minimum number of ties to remove:

- If we take one tie from each of the other colors (red, blue, and pink), we have 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ties.
- Now, we have 13 violet ties left and we need at least two ties of another color (let's say red) to have at least two ties of the same color. If we take one red tie, we'll have 1 violet tie left, which is not enough.

So, we need to take one more tie from the violet color to have two ties (one red and one violet). That means we should remove 4 ties in total (1 from red, 1 from blue, 1 from pink, and 1 from violet).

Therefore, the answer is (C) 4 ties.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost? Answer Choices: (A) 70 (B) 30 (C) 3 (D) 7 (E) 5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the problem statement and given data.
The problem states that a tennis team won 20 matches and lost some percentage of their matches. We need to find the number of matches they lost, which is 30% of their total matches.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of matches played.
Since the team won 20 matches, the total number of matches played is the sum of the wins and losses. Let's denote the total number of matches played as \( T \).

\( T = \text{Wins} + \text{Losses} \)
\( T = 20 + \text{Losses} \)

Step 3: Calculate the number of losses based on the given percentage.
The team lost 30% of their matches, which can be expressed as 0.30 in decimal form. We can set up the following equation to find the number of losses:

\( 0.30 \times T = \text{Losses} \)

Step 4: Substitute the known value of wins into the equation.
Since \( T = 20 + \text{Losses} \), we can substitute \( T \) with 20 + Losses:

\( 0.30(20 + \text{Losses}) = \text{Losses} \)

Step 5: Solve for the losses.
Now we solve for the losses:

\( 6 + 0.30\text{Losses} = \text{Losses} \)

Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the losses:

\( 0.30\text{Losses} = \text{Losses} - 6 \)

\( 6 = \text{Losses} - 0.30\text{Losses} \)

Combine like terms:

\( 6 = 0.70\text{Losses} \)

Divide both sides by 0.70 to find the actual number of losses:

\( \text{Losses} = \frac{6}{0.70} \)

Step 6: Simplify the fraction to get the answer.
\( \text{Losses} = \frac{60}{7} \)

This simplifies to:

\( \text{Losses} = 8 \frac{4}{7} \)

Since the answer choices are integers, we round down to the nearest whole number because we cannot have a fraction of a match.

Therefore, the team lost 8 matches.

However, the given answer choices do not include 8. The closest choice is E) 5, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer should be 8, but since it's not provided, the best we can do is choose the closest integer less than 8, which is 7.

So, the answer should be D) 7.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Add: +45 and -30 Answer Choices: (A) -30 (B) +30 (C) 0 (D) 15 (E) -15

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Adding two numbers (+45 and -30).
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the rule for adding a positive number and a negative number?2. How do you calculate the sum of +45 and -30 using this rule?3. Which of the answer choices represents the result of adding +45 and -30?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions, we know that when you add a positive number (+45) and a negative number (-30), you subtract the absolute value of the negative number from the positive number. So, +45 - (-30) is equivalent to +45 + 30.

Now let's perform the calculation:
+45 + 30 = 75

However, since we're looking for the answer choices, we need to match this result with the given options. The only choice that corresponds to 75 is:

(D) 15

The answer choices might be mislabeled or there could be a mistake in the presentation, but based on the standard rules of addition, the correct answer should be 15, not -15.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 15.

Question:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:students, school, more than 501, 20% physics, 28% math, least possible number of students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation can we perform to find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math if we know the percentages of students taking each subject?2. What: How can we combine the given percentages of students taking physics (20%) and math (28%) to find the maximum overlap without exceeding the total count of more than 501 students?3. Who: In this context, what entity is responsible for ensuring that the least possible number of students are accounted for twice (once in physics and once in math)?4. Where: The problem is set in a school, so how does this context affect the calculation of the least possible number of students?5. When: Is there a specific constraint related to the timeframe in which the school's student population could be determined? If not, why does it not matter in this case?6. Why: Why is finding the least possible number of students important in this situation? Does it relate to budgeting, class sizes, or another relevant factor?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario at a school, the mathematics department and physics department conducted a survey to determine student enrollment. To find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math, we need to perform a mathematical operation known as set intersection. By subtracting the percentage of students taking only one subject from the total, we can estimate the overlap. First, let's calculate the percentage of students taking either physics or math or both. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, we add these two percentages together (20% + 28% = 48%). However, since the total number of students cannot exceed 501, the overlap cannot account for more than this number. To avoid double-counting, we must subtract the sum of the percentages from 100% (the entire student population) and then find the intersection within the remaining 52% (100% - 48%).Now, let's assume that the overlap represents the least possible number of students taking both subjects. This implies that these students would not be counted twice in the physics and math counts. Therefore, the school administration, responsible for maintaining accurate records, is the entity ensuring this consistency.The context of the problem being set in a school affects the calculation because it provides the real-world setting where such enrollment data is typically gathered. However, there is no specific timeframe mentioned, and the calculation does not rely on a particular date, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.The importance of finding the least possible number of students taking both subjects lies in efficient resource allocation and planning. It ensures that when allocating budgets for resources like classrooms, instructors, or materials, the school does not overestimate the demand for combined courses, thereby making the allocation more precise and cost-effective.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: total students, prom night attendance, debating session attendance, maximum number of students who did not attend either.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many students can attend both events (prom night and debating session)?
2. If at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session, what is the maximum percentage of students who could have attended either event?
3. How many students can attend neither event if the maximum number attends one or both?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. Since we want to find the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event, we need to find the minimum number of students who could have attended both. We know that the sum of the percentages cannot exceed 100% (since 100% represents the entire student population). So, if we assume that the maximum number of students attend both events, we need to subtract the combined attendance from 100% to find out how many students could have attended neither.
2. To find the maximum percentage of students attending either event, we can add the percentages of prom night attendees and debating session attendees and then subtract that from 100% to account for the possibility that some students may have attended both. This will give us the upper limit for students attending either event.
3. The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is the total students minus the number of students who attended either or both events.

Let's do the calculations:

- At least 45% attended the prom night, so the maximum number attending both is 45%.
- At least 35% took part in the debating session, so the maximum number attending both is also 35%.

The combined maximum attendance for both events is 45% + 35% = 80%.

Now, to find the maximum number of students who could have attended neither, we subtract this combined attendance from 100%:

100% - 80% = 20%

This means that at most, 20% of the students could have attended neither event. Since there are 200 students in total, the maximum number of students who could have neither is:

200 students * 20% = 200 * 0.20 = 40 students.

However, the answer choices do not include 40. Since we are looking for the maximum number that could have neither, we need to consider the next closest choice that is greater than or equal to 40. The closest option above 40 is 45 (Choice B).

Therefore, the answer is (B) 81 students. This means that at most, 81 students could have attended neither the prom night nor the debating session.

So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: coin-diver, copper coins, brass coins, 20 cents per copper coin, 25 cents per brass coin, total earnings of $3.40.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many copper coins and brass coins can the diver get with $3.40?
2. Given that each copper coin is worth 20 cents and each brass coin is worth 25 cents, how many of each can the diver have if she earns $3.40 in total?
3. To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to maximize the number of brass coins since each brass coin contributes more cents than a copper coin.
4. How many times does $3.40 divide by 25 cents (the value of a brass coin)? This will give us the maximum number of brass coins she can get.
5. Subtract the number of brass coins from the total earnings to find out how much she earned from copper coins.
6. Divide the remaining amount by 20 cents (the value of a copper coin) to find out the minimum number of copper coins.

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. We can express the total earnings in cents: $3.40 = 340 cents.
2. Let's denote the number of copper coins as \( c \) and the number of brass coins as \( b \). We have the equation: \( 20c + 25b = 340 \).
3. To maximize the number of brass coins, we want to find the largest integer \( b \) such that \( 25b \leq 340 \).
4. Dividing 340 by 25 gives us \( b = \frac{340}{25} = 13 \) with a remainder of 15 cents. This means she can get 13 full brass coins and has 15 cents left.
5. Subtracting the value of 13 brass coins from the total gives us \( 340 - (13 \times 25) = 340 - 325 = 15 \) cents from copper coins.
6. Since each copper coin is worth 20 cents, the minimum number of copper coins \( c \) she can have is \( \frac{15}{20} = 0.75 \). Since she can't have a fraction of a coin, she must have 0 copper coins.

Step 4: Conclusion:
The coin-diver can have a maximum of 13 brass coins and no copper coins to earn $3.40. Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brings is 0.

 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bee, flowers, bypasses, 0.05%, nectar, 8 flowers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should we use to find out how many flowers the bee would typically fly by without bypassing any?2. What percentage of flowers does the bee actually inspect when it bypasses 8 flowers?3. How many flowers does the bee inspect before it bypasses one flower?4. Given the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, what fraction of the flowers it encounters represents those it bypasses?5. In order to find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, what formula can we apply using the given bypass rate?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option represents the total number of flowers the bee would inspect if it bypasses 8 flowers based on the given bypass rate?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the bee's flower inspection process, let's denote the total number of flowers as \( F \). According to the problem, the bee bypasses a certain percentage of flowers, which is given as 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \) (as a decimal). 1. To find out how many flowers the bee would typically inspect without bypassing any, we simply divide the total number of flowers by 1, so \( F \) flowers.2. When the bee bypasses 8 flowers, the percentage inspected is \( 100\% - 0.05\% \), which simplifies to \( 99.95\% \) of the flowers. To find the fraction, we divide this percentage by 100: \( \frac{99.95}{100} \).3. To find out how many flowers the bee inspects before bypassing one, we need to invert the bypass rate. Since the bee bypasses 0.05%, it inspects \( 100\% - 0.05\% = 99.95\% \) for each flower. Therefore, we can express this as \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \).4. The fraction of flowers bypassed is the bypass rate, which is 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \).5. To find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, we can set up the equation \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \). Solving for \( F \), we rearrange the terms and multiply both sides by 0.9995 to isolate \( F \).6. Once we solve the equation from step 5, we will get the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, denoted as \( T \).After performing the calculations, we find that:- The bee would inspect \( F \) flowers without bypassing.- It inspects \( \frac{99.95}{100} \) or approximately 99.95% of flowers per flower.- Before bypassing one flower, it inspects \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \) flowers.- The fraction of bypassed flowers is \( 0.0005 \).- The total number of flowers inspected before bypassing 8 is determined by solving \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \).The specific numerical values for the total number of flowers before bypassing 8 cannot be determined without knowing the total number of flowers (\( F \)) in the first place. However, the passage provides the steps needed to calculate it given \( F \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 12 (E) 14
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.
- Jill initially bought 10 bottles of soda for an 8-person party.
- We need to find out how many bottles she would need for a 12-person party.

Step 2: Determine the ratio of bottles to people.
- In the initial party, there were 10 bottles for 8 people. So, the ratio is 10 bottles / 8 people.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bottles per person.
- Divide the total number of bottles by the number of people to find out how many bottles one person consumes: 10 bottles / 8 people = 1.25 bottles/person.

Step 4: Apply the ratio to the new party size.
- For a 12-person party, multiply the bottles per person by the new number of people: 1.25 bottles/person * 12 people = 15 bottles.

Step 5: Compare the answer choices with the calculated result.
- The closest answer choice to 15 bottles is (D) 12.

However, since the question asks for how many bottles Jill would need to buy for a party with 12 people, and the answer choices do not include 15, we need to consider whether she might buy slightly more than the exact amount to account for potential consumption by guests. If she buys just enough for each person, the answer would be 12 bottles, but if she wants to have some extra, she might buy 14 bottles.

Given the options, (E) 14 bottles seems like the most reasonable choice, as it provides a buffer for unexpected guests or higher soda consumption.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.
- The cereal mixture has a ratio of rice to wheat to corn of 2:3:5.
- There are 3 pounds of rice in the mixture.

Step 2: Understand the ratio.
- We can represent the ratio as 2 parts rice : 3 parts wheat : 5 parts corn.
- Since we know the amount of rice (3 pounds), we can find out the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the rice amount by the ratio of rice.

Step 3: Calculate one part of the ratio.
- One part of rice = 3 pounds / 2 (since rice is 2 parts)
- One part of rice = 1.5 pounds.

Step 4: Determine the amount of corn in the mixture.
- Corn is 5 parts in the ratio, so we multiply the value of one part by 5 to find the amount of corn.
- Amount of corn = 1.5 pounds/part * 5 parts

Step 5: Perform the calculation.
- Amount of corn = 7.5 pounds.

Step 6: Match the calculated amount with the answer choices.
- The correct answer is B) 7.5.

Therefore, the bag of the mixture contains 7.5 pounds of corn.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Now we have: [(240) (300)] / (240)

Step 5: Perform the multiplication in the numerator.
240 * 300 = 72,000

Step 6: Divide the result by the denominator.
72,000 / 240 = 300

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Question:The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:number of water lilies, doubles every two days, one water lily, 60 days, lake fully covered, initially, 64 water lilies..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the doubling of water lilies represent in terms of exponential growth?2. How many times does the number of water lilies double during the 60 days when starting with one lily?3. What is the initial condition that needs to be considered for the 64 water lilies?4. In how many days would the lake be half-covered if there were initially 64 water lilies?5. Given the doubling pattern, how many days would it take for 64 water lilies to double to the point of covering half the lake?6. How many doublings are needed for 64 water lilies to cover the entire lake, considering the lake started with one lily?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The doubling of water lilies represents an exponential growth process, where the number of plants increases at a constant rate. To calculate the number of times the lilies double during 60 days, we can use the formula for exponential growth: \( N = N_0 \times 2^{t/d} \), where \( N \) is the final number, \( N_0 \) is the initial number (one lily), \( t \) is the time (in days), and \( d \) is the doubling period.For the first question, since the lake doubles every day, \( d = 1 \) day. So after 60 days, \( N = 1 \times 2^{60/1} = 1 \times 2^{60} \). This indicates that the lilies double 60 times over 60 days.Now, for the second question, since the initial condition was one lily, the lake would be half-covered if there are 64 lilies. To find out how many doublings this represents, we can use the formula again with \( N_0 = 1 \) and \( N = 64 \): \( 64 = 1 \times 2^x \), solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \log_2(64) = 6 \) doublings. For the third question, if there are initially 64 water lilies, we need to determine how many days it takes for them to cover half the lake. Since each doubling covers half the remaining area, we don't need to calculate the exact number of days but can infer that it would be half the number of doublings required for 64 to double to 128 (covering the whole lake). So, it would take 3 doublings (since \( 2^3 = 8 \), and 8 is half of 16).Finally, to find out how many days it takes for 64 lilies to double to cover half the lake, we use the same logic as before: since each doubling halves the remaining area, it would take half the number of doublings to go from 64 to 32, which is \( \log_2(32) = 5 \) days.To cover the entire lake, we've established that 6 doublings are needed, so if we start with one lily, it would take \( 6 \times 1 \) day, which is 6 days.In summary, the doubling of water lilies represents an exponential growth process. Over 60 days, they double 60 times when starting with one lily. For 64 lilies to cover half the lake, it would take 3 doublings, which is approximately 5 days. To cover the entire lake, 64 lilies require 6 doublings, taking 6 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

 Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Shweta, rides, rate of 10 km per hour, stops, 10 minutes rest, every 15 km, cover, 100 km..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Shweta perform when calculating her total travel time?2. What is the distance she covers without stopping each time?3. How many times does she need to stop for a rest during the 100 km journey?4. How long does each rest period last in terms of hours?5. In how many intervals of 15 km does she ride before taking a break?6. How can we combine her riding time and resting time to find the total time taken to cover 100 km?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Shweta's strategy for her 100 km journey involves a unique pattern of riding and resting. She maintains a steady pace without stopping for the first part of the trip. To calculate her total travel time, Shweta performs simple arithmetic by dividing the total distance by her continuous riding speed. Let's assume she rides at a constant speed of 20 km/h.1. When calculating her total travel time, Shweta uses the formula: Time (hours) = Distance (km) / Speed (km/h). Since she rides without stopping initially, we only consider this part of the calculation.2. The distance she covers without stopping each time is 100 km, as she is riding continuously until she reaches the first rest point.3. To find out how many times she needs to stop for a rest, we divide the total distance by the distance she rides before needing a break. Assuming she takes a break after every 15 km, we calculate: Breaks = Total Distance / Interval Distance = 100 km / 15 km = 6.67, which rounds up to 7 breaks because she cannot take a fraction of a break.4. Each rest period lasts the same duration. If she takes a break after completing one interval, the rest time would be the time it takes to ride 15 km at her speed. Rest Time (hours) = Interval Distance (km) / Speed (km/h) = 15 km / 20 km/h = 0.75 hours.5. Since she rides 15 km before taking a break, we can say that she rides in 6 intervals (as calculated above) before stopping for the first time, and then again after each subsequent interval.6. To combine her riding time and resting time, we sum up the time for each interval. There are 7 intervals, including the initial one where she rides continuously. For the first interval, there's no rest, so the time is just the distance divided by speed. For the other intervals, we add the riding time and the rest time. So, Total Time (hours) = (100 km - (15 km * 6)) / 20 km/h + (0.75 hours * 6).In summary, Shweta rides at a speed of 20 km/h, covering 100 km in 5 hours (100 km / 20 km/h), taking 7 breaks, each lasting 0.75 hours. After accounting for the rest periods, her total time to cover 100 km is approximately 5.25 hours (100 km / 20 km/h + (0.75 * 6)).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: well depth, frog position, jump height, fall height, days to reach top.
Step 2: Decompose the problem:
- Each day, the frog makes a net gain of 1 meter (3m jump - 2m fall).
- However, on the last day, the frog will jump 3m and reach the top without falling back, since there's no more depth to fall.
Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed to reach the top with a net gain of 1 meter each day, except for the last day.
- First, subtract the initial depth from the total depth to find out how many meters the frog needs to climb: 30m - 0m = 30m.
- Divide this by the daily net gain: 30m / 1m/day = 30 days.
- Since the frog won't fall on the 30th day, there's no need to subtract the last day from the total.

Answer: The frog will come out of the well in 30 days.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 28 days, because we count the last day when the frog jumps out without falling back.

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars?
 Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Car 'X', distance 320 kms, 8 hours, Car 'Y', distance 415 kms, 5 hours, speed difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which car has a higher speed: Car 'X' or Car 'Y'?2. How far does Car 'X' travel per hour?3. What is the speed of Car 'X' in kilometers per hour?4. How far does Car 'Y' travel per hour?5. What is the speed of Car 'Y' in kilometers per hour?6. To find the speed difference, how many kilometers per hour does Car 'Y' travel more than Car 'X'?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After analyzing the given data, we can determine the speeds and distances traveled by both cars, Car 'X' and Car 'Y'. Unfortunately, no specific numerical values were provided for the speeds or distances. However, we can assume that if you have the necessary information, such as their respective speeds in miles per hour (mph) or meters per second (m/s), we can convert them into kilometers per hour (km/h) using the following conversions:1 mph = 1.60934 km/h1 m/s = 3.6 km/hTo compare the speeds, let's denote the speed of Car 'X' as \( V_X \) (in km/h) and the speed of Car 'Y' as \( V_Y \) (also in km/h). If \( V_X > V_Y \), then Car 'X' has a higher speed.For the distances traveled per hour, we would need the time traveled for each car to calculate the distance covered. Assuming they travel at constant speeds, the distance \( D_X \) for Car 'X' in one hour is \( V_X \) multiplied by the time, and similarly for Car 'Y', the distance \( D_Y \) is \( V_Y \) times the time.The speed difference between Car 'Y' and Car 'X' is calculated as \( |V_Y - V_X| \) (absolute value since we are only interested in the magnitude).Without the actual speeds, we cannot provide specific numbers for these calculations. However, if you provide the speeds or any other relevant data, we can easily perform the calculations and construct the passage accordingly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Allen, X, Y, Bob, directions, speeds, meeting twice, distance between X and Y, 54 kmph, 78 kmph, 48 km difference.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How long does it take for Allen to travel from X to Y and back to X?
2. How long does it take for Bob to travel from Y to X and back to Y?
3. How far does Allen travel during the first round trip (from X to Y)?
4. How far does Bob travel during the first round trip (from Y to X)?
5. How far does Allen travel during the second round trip (from Y to X)?
6. How far does Bob travel during the second round trip (from X to Y)?
7. Since they meet for the second time, how many round trips have they completed in total?
8. How much distance does each complete round trip cover for both Allen and Bob?
9. Using the speed and time information, find the distance covered by each in the second round trip.
10. Calculate the difference in distance covered by Bob and Allen in the second round trip.
11. Use the difference in distance to find the distance between X and Y.

Step 3: Analyze these new questions:
1. Allen's round trip time = (Distance from X to Y + Distance from Y to X) / Speed = 2 * Distance between X and Y / 54 kmph.
2. Bob's round trip time = (Distance from Y to X + Distance from X to Y) / Speed = 2 * Distance between X and Y / 78 kmph.
3. Allen's first round trip distance = Distance between X and Y.
4. Bob's first round trip distance = Distance between X and Y.
5. Allen's second round trip distance = Distance from Y to X = Distance between X and Y.
6. Bob's second round trip distance = Distance from X to Y = Distance between X and Y.
7. Since they meet for the second time, they have completed one round trip each, so two round trips in total.
8. One round trip for both Allen and Bob = 2 * Distance between X and Y.
9. Allen's second round trip distance = 54 kmph * (time for one round trip) = 54 kmph * (2 * Distance between X and Y / 54 kmph) = 2 * Distance between X and Y.
10. Bob's second round trip distance = 78 kmph * (time for one round trip) = 78 kmph * (2 * Distance between X and Y / 78 kmph) = 2 * Distance between X and Y.
11. Difference in second round trip distance = Bob's second round trip distance - Allen's second round trip distance = 2 * Distance between X and Y - 2 * Distance between X and Y = 0 km.

Since the difference in distance covered by Bob and Allen in the second round trip is 48 km, but the difference is actually 0 km, there seems to be an inconsistency in the question or the answer choices provided. Given the information, it's not possible to determine the distance between X and Y with the provided data.

Therefore, the answer is E) 48 km, but this may not be the correct answer due to the inconsistency in the problem statement. If the problem is correct, it implies that there is a misprint or error in the question or answer choices, and the distance between X and Y should be 0 km, not 48 km.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx)
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: liquid, drain, rate, gallons, seconds, minutes, and variables w, x, and y.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we find the rate of flow in gallons per minute from the given rate in gallons per x seconds?
2. How can we express y gallons in terms of the flow rate and time in minutes?
3. What is the formula to convert the time from seconds to minutes?
4. Which expression represents the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain?

Step 3: Analyze the given information:
- Rate of flow = w/25 gallons per x seconds
- We need to find the rate in gallons per minute, which is equivalent to (w/25) gallons per (x seconds * 60 seconds/minute) = (w/25) * (60/x) gallons per minute.

Step 4: Apply the conversion to find the flow rate in gallons per minute:
\[ \text{Flow rate in gallons per minute} = \frac{w}{25} \cdot \frac{60}{x} = \frac{60w}{25x} \]

Step 5: Now, we need to find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain at this rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{y \text{ gallons}}{\text{Flow rate in gallons per minute}} = \frac{y}{\frac{60w}{25x}} = \frac{25xy}{60w} \]

Step 6: Simplify the expression to match the answer choices:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{25xy}{60w} = \frac{5xy}{12w} \cdot \frac{1}{x} = \frac{5xy}{12wx} \cdot \frac{1}{x} = \frac{5y}{12wx} \text{ minutes} \]

This matches the expression C) 5xy/(12w).

 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: jeep, distance, forward journey, 6 hours, return journey, increased speed by 12 km/hr, 4 hours, find distance.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we relate the speed of the jeep in the forward journey to its speed in the return journey?
2. What is the formula to calculate distance when speed and time are known?
3. How do we find the initial speed of the jeep in the forward journey if we know the increased speed for the return journey?
4. How do we use the time difference between the forward and return journeys to find the relationship between the speeds?
5. Given the increased speed in the return journey, how can we find the original speed for the forward journey?
6. Using the original speed for the forward journey, how can we calculate the distance?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- We know that the jeep travels the same distance in both directions, so we can equate the distances.
- The speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so we can find the original speed by subtracting 12 km/hr from the increased speed.
- The time for the return journey is less than the time for the forward journey, so the increased speed must compensate for the shorter time.

Let's denote the original speed of the jeep in the forward journey as \( v \) km/hr. The increased speed for the return journey would be \( v + 12 \) km/hr.

From the problem, we have:
- Forward journey time: \( t_{forward} = 6 \) hours
- Return journey time: \( t_{return} = 4 \) hours

Using the formula for distance \( d = s \times t \), where \( s \) is speed and \( t \) is time, we can write the following equations for the forward and return journeys:

\[ d = v \times t_{forward} \]
\[ d = (v + 12) \times t_{return} \]

Since the distance is the same in both cases, we can equate them:

\[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Now, solve for \( v \):

\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]
\[ 2v = 48 \]
\[ v = 24 \] (km/hr)

Now that we have the original speed, we can find the distance for either journey:

\[ d = v \times t_{forward} \]
\[ d = 24 \times 6 \]
\[ d = 144 \] (km)

So, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2.

When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?

To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.
 Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, eat, fruit (breakfast), vegetable (dinner), 6 different types of fruit, 8 different types of vegetables, eat one type at a time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of combinations when selecting one type of fruit for breakfast?2. How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day. Answer Choices: (A) 93 men (B) 94 men (C) 95 men (D) 96 men (E) 97 men
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:8 men, 6 days, complete a work, 1/2 day, required men.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much work is done by 8 men in 6 days?2. How much work is done by 1 man in 1 day?3. How much work is done by 1 man in 1/2 day?4. How many men are required to complete the same amount of work in 1/2 day if the work rate is the same?5. Which answer choice corresponds to the number of men required for this task?
Step 3: Analyze the relationships:
- To find the total work done by 8 men in 6 days, we can multiply the number of men by the number of days they work together: \( 8 \text{ men} \times 6 \text{ days} \).
- Since we want to find the work done by 1 man in 1 day, we divide the total work by the number of men: \( \frac{\text{total work}}{8 \text{ men}} \).
- Then, to find the work done by 1 man in 1/2 day, we halve the work done in 1 day: \( \frac{\text{work in 1 day}}{2} \).
- Finally, to find the number of men required to do the same amount of work in 1/2 day, we divide the total work by the work done by 1 man in 1/2 day: \( \frac{\text{total work}}{\text{work in 1/2 day}} \).

Let's calculate the work done by 8 men in 6 days first:
\[ \text{Work} = 8 \text{ men} \times 6 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to find the work done by 1 man in 1 day:
\[ \text{Work per man in 1 day} = \frac{\text{Work}}{8 \text{ men}} \]

Next, we find the work done by 1 man in 1/2 day:
\[ \text{Work per man in 1/2 day} = \frac{\text{Work per man in 1 day}}{2} \]

Finally, we find the number of men required for 1/2 day:
\[ \text{Men required for 1/2 day} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Work per man in 1/2 day}} \]

Let's perform the calculations:
\[ \text{Work} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \text{ units} \]
\[ \text{Work per man in 1 day} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \text{ units} \]
\[ \text{Work per man in 1/2 day} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ units} \]
\[ \text{Men required for 1/2 day} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ men} \]

However, the answer choices are not provided in the same format. The closest answer choice that matches our calculation is D) 96 men, which is likely a typo or a misinterpretation of the question. The correct interpretation would be that 16 men are required for 1/2 day, but since the answer choices don't match, we cannot definitively select an answer from the given options.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 97 men, as it is the closest option to represent the incorrect interpretation of the problem.

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Two balls A and B, circular track, ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, same starting point, when will they be at the same point again.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many rotations does ball A make in one minute?2. How many rotations does ball B make in one minute?3. How many minutes does it take for ball A to make one full rotation?4. How many minutes does it take for ball B to make one full rotation?5. How many common multiples of the rotation periods of ball A and ball B exist?6. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotation periods of ball A and ball B?7. Using the LCM, how many minutes will it take for both balls to be at the same starting point again?
Step 3: Analyze and solve:

1. Ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, so one rotation takes \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) minutes.
2. Ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, so one rotation takes \( \frac{35}{5} = 7 \) minutes.

3. Since ball A takes 13 minutes for one rotation, we don't need to find the time for one full rotation.
4. For ball B, it's already given that one rotation takes 7 minutes.

5. We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7 minutes. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. In this case, the LCM is 91 (since 13 and 7 are prime and 7 * 13 = 91).

6. Both balls will be at the same starting point again after the LCM of their rotation periods, which is 91 minutes.

7. Since both balls start at the same time, we add 91 minutes to the initial time.

8. So, the total time taken is 91 minutes.

The answer choices do not include the initial time, so we only consider the additional time:
91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Answer: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
 Answer Choices: (A) M + N / 8 (B) 2M + N / 8 (C) M + N / 4 (D) M + 3N / 8 (E) M + N / 5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:athlete, M miles, 4 hours, rides, bike, N miles, average speed, miles per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation combines the distances M miles and N miles to find the total distance traveled for both activities?2. How should the time taken (4 hours) be incorporated when calculating the average speed?3. What type of average speed is being asked for - arithmetic mean or another form?4. Who or what is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the athlete running and biking or just the combined activities?5. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the combined activities' performance?6. How are the values M and N related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different modes of transportation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When combining the distances covered during two separate activities, one can use the addition operation to find the total distance traveled. For instance, if an athlete runs M miles and then cycles N miles, the combined distance, denoted as D_total, would be calculated as follows:D_total = M miles + N milesTo incorporate the time taken for both activities, let's say it's 4 hours, we need to calculate the average speed, which represents the overall efficiency in terms of distance covered per unit time. The average speed (V_avg) is found by dividing the total distance by the total time spent on the activities:V_avg = D_total / Time (in hours)In this case, the average speed is an arithmetic mean, as it's a simple average of the speeds achieved during each mode of transportation without considering any variations or weights.The subject of the "average speed" calculation is the athlete, as it reflects their combined performance in running and biking. This average speed gives an indication of their overall pace for the day, regardless of whether they were faster on one activity or the other.The context in which this average speed is relevant is when assessing the athlete's endurance or comparing their performance across different days. By calculating V_avg, we can gauge how efficiently they utilized their time and energy during the combined running and biking session.The values M and N are directly related to the average speed formula, as they contribute to the numerator (total distance), while the time taken (4 hours) serves as the denominator, ultimately determining the rate at which the athlete covered the combined distance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is Answer Choices: (A) 4 1/3 km/h (B) 7 2/3 km/h (C) 9 ½ km/h (D) 8 km/h (E) 81 km/h
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: man, walking, speed, time, average speed.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How far does the man walk at 5 kmph for 6 hours?
2. How far does the man walk at 4 kmph for 12 hours?
3. What is the total distance walked by the man?
4. How do we calculate the average speed when we have the total distance and the total time?
5. Which formula can be used to find the average speed (average speed = total distance / total time)?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. To find the distance at a constant speed, we multiply the speed by the time: \( Distance_1 = Speed_1 \times Time_1 \).
2. Similarly, for the second part: \( Distance_2 = Speed_2 \times Time_2 \).
3. The total distance walked is the sum of the two distances: \( Total\_Distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2 \).
4. The average speed is calculated using the formula: \( Average\_Speed = \frac{Total\_Distance}{Total\_Time} \).
5. We'll plug in the values from the question to find the average speed.

Now, let's calculate:

\( Distance_1 = 5 \text{ kmph} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ km} \)
\( Distance_2 = 4 \text{ kmph} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ km} \)

Total distance: \( Total\_Distance = 30 \text{ km} + 48 \text{ km} = 78 \text{ km} \)

Total time: \( Total\_Time = 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ hours} \)

Average speed: \( Average\_Speed = \frac{78 \text{ km}}{18 \text{ hours}} \)

Now, let's calculate the average speed.

\( Average\_Speed = \frac{78}{18} = \frac{13}{3} \text{ km/h} \)

This simplifies to \( 4 \frac{1}{3} \text{ km/h} \).

So the correct answer is (A) 4 1/3 km/h.

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about.

If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Question:Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two ants, Ant A and Ant B, moving towards each other, speeds, distance between farms, distance Ant A travels.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we find the time it takes for the ants to meet?
2. What is the combined speed of Ant A and Ant B when they move towards each other?
3. Using the time and combined speed, how can we find the distance Ant A travels?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. To find the time it takes for the ants to meet, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Combined Speed. The distance is the sum of the distances each ant has to travel, which is the distance between their farms (75 cm).
2. The combined speed of Ant A and Ant B is the sum of their individual speeds: 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour.
3. Once we have the time, we can multiply it by Ant A's speed to find the distance Ant A travels.

Let's calculate the time first:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance between farms}}{\text{Combined speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ cm}}{15 \text{ cm/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we'll find the distance Ant A travels:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Ant A} = \text{Ant A's speed} \times \text{Time} = 9 \text{ cm/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 45 \text{ cm} \]

The answer is (A) 45 cm.

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question: Three bells, intervals, and the need to find the next time they will ring together.

Step 2: Understand the problem: We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three given intervals (36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds) because the bells will ring together again when the time elapsed is a multiple of all three intervals.

Step 3: Calculate the LCM:
- List the prime factors of each number: 
   - 36 = 2^2 * 3^2
   - 40 = 2^3 * 5
   - 48 = 2^4 * 3

- Find the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
   - For 2: 2^4 (from 48)
   - For 3: 3^2 (from 36)
   - For 5: 5 (from 40)

- Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:
   - LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 16 * 9 * 5 = 720 seconds

Step 4: Convert the LCM from seconds to minutes, since the answer choices are in minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:
   - 720 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 12 minutes

Step 5: Match the answer with the choices: The bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Three friends (Alan, Roger, Peter), answer a question, exam, Alan, 1/5 probability, guessing correctly, Roger, cheating, 2/3 probability, answering correctly, Peter, 5/6 probability, correct answer, cheating not via..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the probability of a correct answer without cheating?2. What is the probability that Alan answers the question correctly?3. How can we combine Alan's and Peter's probabilities to find the total non-cheating probability?4. Who has the highest probability of answering correctly without cheating?5. In what context does the problem take place, i.e., the exam situation?6. Why is it important to consider both cheating and non-cheating probabilities when determining the overall answer?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In an exam setting, it is crucial to account for both cheating and non-cheating probabilities when assessing a student's performance. To find the probability of a correct answer without cheating, one would typically use the concept of independent events. If Alan and Peter each have their own individual chances of answering correctly, which are P(A) and P(P), respectively, without any prior information about their study habits, we assume they are independent.To calculate the probability of Alan answering correctly (P(A)) without cheating, we need to know his actual skill level or the provided probability. Let's say P(A) = 0.7, meaning there's a 70% chance he knows the answer. Similarly, if Peter's probability is P(P) = 0.6, he has a 60% chance of getting it right.To combine their probabilities for the total non-cheating probability, we multiply their individual probabilities because their actions are assumed to be independent. So, the combined probability (P(both correct)) is P(A) * P(P) = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42, or 42%.Comparing their probabilities, Alan has a slightly higher non-cheating probability than Peter. This indicates that, without any external influence, Alan is more likely to answer correctly on this particular question.In conclusion, considering both cheating and non-cheating probabilities is essential in an exam context as it provides a comprehensive understanding of students' abilities. It ensures fairness and accuracy in evaluating their knowledge without being swayed by potential dishonesty. In this case, Alan has the highest probability of answering correctly without cheating, which contributes to a more reliable assessment of their academic prowess.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Roy was suffering from severe headaches. He went to see his doctor and the doctor gave him 5 tablets asking him to take one tablet every 15 minutes.
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Understand the situation
Roy is experiencing severe headaches and has gone to see his doctor. The doctor has prescribed him with 5 tablets.

Step 2: Interpret the instructions
The doctor instructed Roy to take one tablet every 15 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the time intervals
Since Roy needs to take a tablet every 15 minutes, we can determine the sequence of times he would take the tablets by counting up in 15-minute increments:

- First tablet: 0 minutes (start)
- Second tablet: 15 minutes later
- Third tablet: 15 minutes after the second (30 minutes)
- Fourth tablet: 15 minutes after the third (45 minutes)
- Fifth tablet: 15 minutes after the fourth (60 minutes)

Step 4: Check if the last tablet is within the 15-minute interval
Since 60 minutes is exactly one hour, and the doctor's instructions were to take the last tablet after 15 minutes, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or an error in the prescription. It's possible that the doctor meant for Roy to take the last tablet after an hour (60 minutes) and then wait another 15 minutes before taking any additional tablets if necessary.

Step 5: Answer the question
Based on the information given, Roy would take his first tablet immediately, followed by the second tablet after 15 minutes, the third after 30 minutes, the fourth after 45 minutes, and the fifth tablet exactly one hour (60 minutes) after starting the sequence.

However, if the doctor intended for Roy to take only one tablet every hour, then the sequence would be different, with the last tablet being taken after 5 hours (assuming Roy starts taking the first tablet at the beginning of the visit).

Without further clarification from the doctor, it's not possible to definitively answer the question. If you need to choose an answer from the given options, you might need to consider the most likely interpretation based on common medical practice or the context provided.

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Kevin, drive from A to B, constant speed 70 mph, return trip at 90 mph, 3 hours before end, 70 miles from B, find distance between A and B.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How long did it take Kevin to travel from A to B at 70 mph?
2. How long did it take him to travel back from B to A at 90 mph?
3. How far did Kevin travel during the first part of the round trip (before he was 70 miles from B)?
4. How far did he travel during the second part of the round trip (from being 70 miles from B to the end)?
5. Since he was 70 miles from B 3 hours before the end, how long was the entire trip (including the time he spent at 70 miles from B)?
6. Using the information from steps 3 and 4, how can we find the total distance between A and B?

Step 3: Analyze the information and solve the questions:
1. Time to travel from A to B = Distance / Speed = D / 70 (where D is the distance between A and B).
2. Time to travel from B to A = Distance / Speed = D / 90.
3. Since he was 70 miles from B 3 hours before the end, the time spent at this point is 3 hours. During this time, he traveled at a speed of 70 mph, so the distance covered is 70 miles * 3 hours = 210 miles.
4. The remaining distance from B to A at the end of the trip is D - 70 miles, and this took 3 hours less than the time it took to go from A to B. So, the time for this part is (D / 70) - 3 hours. The distance for this part is (D - 70) miles.
5. The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time to A to B and the time from B to A: (D / 70) + ((D - 70) / 90) = 3 hours + 3 hours (since he was 70 miles from B 3 hours before the end).

Now we can set up an equation:
(D / 70) + ((D - 70) / 90) = 6 hours (total trip time)

Step 4: Solve for D:
Multiplying all terms by the least common multiple of 70 and 90 (which is 6300), we get:
(90D + 70(D - 70)) = 6 * 6300
90D + 70D - 4900 = 37800
160D = 42700
D = 267.125

However, since distance cannot be a fraction, we need to check which answer choice is closest to 267.125. The only whole number that is close is 270, which is option C.

Therefore, the distance between A and B is approximately 270 miles.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
 Answer Choices: (A) M + N / 8 (B) 2M + N / 8 (C) M + N / 4 (D) M + 3N / 8 (E) M + N / 5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:athlete, M miles, 4 hours, rides, bike, N miles, average speed, miles per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation combines the distances M miles and N miles to find the total distance traveled for both activities?2. How should the time taken (4 hours) be incorporated when calculating the average speed?3. What type of average speed is being asked for - arithmetic mean or another form?4. Who or what is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the athlete running and biking or just the combined activities?5. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the combined activities' performance?6. How are the values M and N related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different modes of transportation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When combining the distances covered during two separate activities, one can use the addition operation to find the total distance traveled. For instance, if an athlete runs M miles and then cycles N miles, the combined distance, denoted as D_total, would be calculated as follows:D_total = M miles + N milesTo incorporate the time taken for both activities, let's say it's 4 hours, we need to calculate the average speed, which represents the overall efficiency in terms of distance covered per unit time. The average speed (V_avg) is found by dividing the total distance by the total time spent on the activities:V_avg = D_total / Time (in hours)In this case, the average speed is an arithmetic mean, as it's a simple average of the speeds achieved during each mode of transportation without considering any variations or weights.The subject of the "average speed" calculation is the athlete, as it reflects their combined performance in running and biking. This average speed gives an indication of their overall pace for the day, regardless of whether they were faster on one activity or the other.The context in which this average speed is relevant is when assessing the athlete's endurance or comparing their performance across different days. By calculating V_avg, we can gauge how efficiently they utilized their time and energy during the combined running and biking session.The values M and N are directly related to the average speed formula, as they contribute to the numerator (total distance), while the time taken (4 hours) serves as the denominator, ultimately determining the rate at which the athlete covered the combined distance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: aeroplane, four sides of a square, speeds, average speed, around the field.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the formula for finding the average speed when the total distance and total time are known?
2. How can we calculate the total distance traveled by the aeroplane around the square?
3. Do we need to consider the time taken for each side separately or is it the same for all sides?
4. Given the speeds for each side, how do we find the total time taken to fly around the square?
5. How do we combine the total distance and total time to find the average speed?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- The average speed formula is \( \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \).
- The total distance around a square is the perimeter, which can be found by multiplying the side length by 4.
- Since the aeroplane travels at different speeds for each side, the time taken for each side is different but the total time taken to complete one round is the sum of the times for each side.
- We can find the time for each side by dividing the side length by the respective speed and then summing these times.

Let's denote the side length of the square as \( s \) (in km) and the speeds as \( v_1, v_2, v_3, \text{ and } v_4 \) (in km/hr), where \( v_1 = 200 \), \( v_2 = 400 \), \( v_3 = 600 \), and \( v_4 = 800 \).

The total distance around the square is \( 4s \) and the total time taken \( T \) is the sum of the times for each side, \( T = \frac{s}{v_1} + \frac{s}{v_2} + \frac{s}{v_3} + \frac{s}{v_4} \).

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4s}{\frac{s}{v_1} + \frac{s}{v_2} + \frac{s}{v_3} + \frac{s}{v_4}} \]

We don't have the side length \( s \) given, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can simplify the expression for the average speed without knowing \( s \):

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{v_1} + \frac{1}{v_2} + \frac{1}{v_3} + \frac{1}{v_4}} \]

Substituting the given speeds:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{400} + \frac{1}{600} + \frac{1}{800}} \]

Now, we can calculate this simplified fraction.

Step 4: Calculate the average speed without the side length:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4}{\frac{400 + 200 + 100 + 62.5}{400 \times 200 \times 600 \times 800}} \]
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4}{\frac{762.5}{(4 \times 10^6)}} \]
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4}{\frac{762.5}{4 \times 10^6}} \]
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{4 \times 4 \times 10^6}{762.5} \]
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{16 \times 10^6}{762.5} \]

We can approximate this value, but since we don't have the exact value for \( s \), we cannot choose a specific answer choice from the given options.

Without the numerical value, the best we can do is recognize that the answer will be a large number because the denominator is less than the numerator, and the options given do not match this description.

Therefore, without a specific numerical value for \( s \), we cannot definitively select an answer from the choices provided. However, we can infer that the correct answer should be greater than 400 km/hr, as the numerator is 16 times larger than the denominator. None of the given choices meet this criterion, so the correct answer might not be among the choices provided.

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Anna has 4 books. If she decide to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and moved just one book every minute, how long would it taken by her ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 minutes (B) 30 minutes (C) 15 minutes (D) 24 minutes (E) 35 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Anna, 4 books, every possible combination, one book moved per minute, time taken.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many ways can Anna arrange 4 books?2. What is the formula to calculate permutations of n objects?3. Calculate the total number of permutations for 4 books.4. Since Anna moves one book per minute, how many minutes will it take to complete all permutations?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
- The number of ways to arrange n objects is given by the factorial function, denoted as n! (n factorial). This counts the number of permutations of n items, where order matters.
- For 4 books, the number of permutations is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1.
- Since Anna moves one book per minute, we simply need to divide the total number of permutations by 1 to get the total time in minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of permutations for 4 books:
\[ 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \]

Since Anna moves one book per minute, it will take her 24 minutes to arrange all the books in every possible combination.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 24 minutes.

 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3.

How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Question:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sharon, 5 hours, Karen, 4 hours, buy the cake together..

When they work together, after how many hours will their combined earnings equal the cost of the cake?6. What is the mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together based on their individual work hours?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Sharon and Karen are saving up to buy a cake that costs $24. Each hour, Sharon earns $8, while Karen earns $6 per hour. To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Alex, Jacob, toy shop, time to make a toy, total toys made, similar number of hours.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many toys does Alex make in a month if he takes 7 hours to make one toy?2. How many toys does Jacob make in a month if he takes 9 hours to make one toy?3. If they both make a total of 35 toys, how many hours does each work if they have worked for almost similar number of hours?4. How many toys have been prepared by Jacob if the total hours worked by both are equal?
Step 3: Analyze these new questions:
- Alex makes toys at a rate of 1 toy per 7 hours.
- Jacob makes toys at a rate of 1 toy per 9 hours.

Let's denote the number of toys Alex makes as \( A \) and the number of toys Jacob makes as \( J \). We know that \( A + J = 35 \) (total toys).

Since they worked for almost similar number of hours, let's denote the total hours worked by both as \( H \). Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours, the total number of toys they can make together in \( H \) hours is \( \frac{H}{7} \) for Alex and \( \frac{H}{9} \) for Jacob.

Since they both made 35 toys, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{H}{7} + \frac{H}{9} = 35 \]

To find out how many toys Jacob made, we need to solve for \( J \) given \( A = 35 - J \) and the above equation.

Step 4: Solve for \( J \):
From the equation \( \frac{H}{7} + \frac{H}{9} = 35 \), we can find \( H \) by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 7 and 9, which is 63:
\[ 9H + 7H = 35 \times 63 \]
\[ 16H = 2205 \]
\[ H = \frac{2205}{16} \]

Now, since \( A + J = 35 \), we can substitute \( A = 35 - J \) into the equation:
\[ (35 - J) + J = \frac{2205}{16} \]
\[ 35 = \frac{2205}{16} \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 35 - \frac{2205}{16} \]
\[ J = 35 - 138.4375 \]
\[ J \approx -103.4375 \]

This result doesn't make sense because the number of toys Jacob can make cannot be negative. There must be an error in the problem statement or the interpretation of "similar number of hours." Assuming they worked for exactly the same number of hours, we can't determine the exact number of toys Jacob made because we don't have enough information about the total hours worked.

However, since we are asked to find a choice from the given options, we can try to find the closest integer to 0 that fits within the total number of toys (35). Since Jacob's rate is slower, he would make fewer toys than Alex even if they worked the same number of hours.

Given the options, we can look for the smallest integer greater than 0 that adds up to 35 with Alex's contribution (35 - J). The closest such integer for Jacob would be 15 (since 35 - 15 = 20, and 20 is closer to 19 than to 16).

Therefore, the most reasonable answer based on the available information is:

Input:
Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: car, straight line, uniform speed, vertical tower, angle of elevation, time, 45° to 60°.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How does the angle of elevation relate to the car's position and the tower's height?
2. What is the relationship between the angles of 45° and 60° and the height of the tower?
3. How can we use trigonometry to find the height of the tower based on the car's initial position and the angles?
4. Once we have the height of the tower, how can we determine the remaining distance the car needs to travel to reach the base?
5. Given the car's uniform speed, how can we calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining distance?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, which indicates that the car is moving closer to the tower. As the angle increases, the horizontal distance traveled decreases.
- We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the height of the tower (tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent). At 45°, the opposite side (height) is equal to the adjacent side (horizontal distance), so the height is initially unknown. At 60°, the height is the opposite side, and the adjacent side is less than the initial horizontal distance.
- To find the height of the tower, we can use the difference in tangent values: h = (opposite at 60° - opposite at 45°) / (tan(60°) - tan(45°)).
- Once we have the height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the remaining horizontal distance since the car is moving in a straight line. The remaining distance is the square root of the height squared plus the initial horizontal distance squared.
- With the remaining distance and the car's uniform speed, we can use the formula time = distance/speed to find the additional time needed.

Step 4: Calculate the height and remaining distance:
- Let's denote the initial horizontal distance as x (which is also the height at 45°).
- At 60°, the height is h, and the adjacent side is x - h.
- Using the tangent function, we have:
   h = x * (tan(60°) - tan(45°)) = x * (√3 - 1)
- Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the remaining distance:
   Remaining distance = √(h^2 + x^2) = √((x * (√3 - 1))^2 + x^2)

Step 5: Calculate the additional time:
- Since the car's speed is constant, we can use the formula:
   Additional time = Remaining distance / Speed

We don't have the speed given, but we don't need it to answer the question, as we're looking for the time in terms of x and the constants (√3 and 1).

Step 6: Answer choice analysis:
- We cannot directly find the exact time without the speed, but we can express the answer in terms of x and the constants. The answer choices do not contain x, so they must represent a relationship between the time and the constants. However, none of the options match the expression we derived above.

Conclusion: The correct answer is (E) None of these, as none of the provided choices match the expression for the additional time found in Step 5.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time.

 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2.

When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Mr. Sam, train journey, car journey, round trip, time taken, loss of time, car both ways.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How long does Mr. Sam take for the round trip by train?
2. What is the time difference between the train and car journeys for a single way?
3. If Mr. Sam takes 17 hours for the round trip by train, and loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train, how long does it take him for a single train journey?
4. If the single train journey takes half the time of the round trip, what is the time for a single train journey?
5. If Mr. Sam takes 17 hours for the round trip by train and the single train journey takes X hours, how long does it take him to go by car for a single way?
6. If the car journey for a single way takes Y hours, what is the total time for the round trip by car (going and returning)?
7. How much time does Mr. Sam save by going both ways by car instead of by train?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours for the round trip by train.
2. The time difference between train and car is 4 hours (since he loses 4 hours when going both ways by train).
3. Single train journey time is half of the round trip time, so X = 17/2 = 8.5 hours.
4. Going by car for a single way takes Y hours, which we don't know yet.
5. If X (train) is 8.5 hours and the round trip is 17 hours, then the car journey for a single way is 17 - 8.5 = 8.5 hours (Y = 8.5).
6. For the round trip by car, we multiply the single way time by 2: 8.5 hours * 2 = 17 hours.
7. Since the car journey is 17 hours for a round trip, Mr. Sam saves 4 hours compared to the train round trip.

Step 4: Answer the original question based on the analysis:
If Mr. Sam had traveled by car in both ways, he would have taken 17 hours (the time for the round trip by car).

Therefore, the answer is (E) 13 hours. This is because the question asks for the time he would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways, not the time saved by doing so.

What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: space shuttle, maximum speed, height, time, passing a point, length.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the shuttle's vertical speed (height per second)?
2. How long does it take for the shuttle to cover the height it travels at maximum speed?
3. If it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, does this mean the shuttle covers its own length in 5 seconds?
4. How can we find the length of the shuttle if we know its speed and the time it takes to pass a point?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. We can find the shuttle's vertical speed by dividing the height it travels by the time it takes to travel that height: \( \text{Vertical speed} = \frac{\text{Height}}{\text{Time}} \).
2. Given the time to travel 700 meters at maximum speed, we can use this to find the shuttle's length by multiplying the vertical speed by the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds): \( \text{Length} = \text{Vertical speed} \times \text{Time to pass a point} \).

Step 4: Calculate the vertical speed:
\[ \text{Vertical speed} = \frac{700\text{ m}}{40\text{ s}} = 17.5\text{ m/s} \]

Step 5: Calculate the length of the shuttle:
\[ \text{Length} = 17.5\text{ m/s} \times 5\text{ s} \]

Step 6: Perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Length} = 87.5\text{ m} \]

However, this is not one of the given choices. There might be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 87.5 meters, which is not listed. If the answer choices are correct, there seems to be an issue with the question or options provided.

If the question is correct, the closest choice would be (E) 150 m, which is the only option that is significantly smaller than the calculated length. However, without more context or confirmation, it's best to consider the possibility of an error in the question or the answer choices.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Question:Train A leaves a station every 16 minutes and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again? Answer Choices: (A) 272 minutes (B) 304 minutes (C) 190 minutes (D) 70 minutes (E) 35 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Train A, leaves every 16 minutes, Train B, leaves every 17 minutes, simultaneous departure, next meeting time.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17? This will give us the time interval when both trains will leave the station together again.
2. How many times does Train A leave the station within that LCM interval? Since Train A leaves every 16 minutes, we can divide the LCM by 16 to find out how many times it leaves within the LCM period.
3. How many times does Train B leave the station within that LCM interval? Similar to Train A, we can divide the LCM by 17 to find out how many times Train B leaves within the LCM period.
4. How long is the time between these events (the next time both trains leave simultaneously)? We can find this by subtracting the number of times Train A leaves from the number of times Train B leaves, since they both leave at the same time when they're both on the same cycle.

Step 3: Calculate the LCM of 16 and 17:
- The prime factors of 16 are 2^4 (2 raised to the power of 4).
- The prime factors of 17 are just 17 (it's a prime number).
- The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved: \(2^4 \times 17 = 16 \times 17 = 272\).

Step 4: Determine how many times each train leaves within the LCM interval:
- Train A leaves 272 / 16 = 17 times within 272 minutes.
- Train B leaves 272 / 17 = 16 times within 272 minutes.

Step 5: Find the time between the next simultaneous departures:
Since Train A leaves 17 times and Train B leaves 16 times within the LCM, the next time they both leave simultaneously will be when Train B leaves after Train A has already done so once. Therefore, we subtract 1 from the number of times Train A leaves:
- Time between next departures = 17 (Train A's cycles) - 1 = 16 cycles.

Step 6: Convert the number of cycles back to minutes:
- Time between next departures = 16 cycles * 16 minutes/cycle = 256 minutes.

However, this is not among the given choices. There seems to be an error in the answer choices, as the correct answer should be 16 cycles of 17 minutes (since Train B leaves first), which equals 272 minutes.

 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4.

Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed.

Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace.

Question:A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: fan blade, point, edge, rotation, plane, 10 cm from center, revolutions per minute (rpm), time (30 seconds), distance traveled.

Step 2: Decompose the question into smaller parts:
- Determine the angular speed of the fan blade in radians per second (radians/s).
- Calculate the number of revolutions in 30 seconds.
- Convert revolutions to radians.
- Calculate the total angle traveled by the point in radians.
- Convert the angle traveled to linear distance (centimeters) using the radius (10 cm).

Step 3: Calculate the angular speed:
- Given: 300 revolutions per minute (rpm)
- Convert rpm to revolutions per second (r/s): \( \frac{300 \text{ rpm}}{60 \text{ s/min}} = 5 \text{ r/s} \)

Step 4: Calculate the total angle in radians for 30 seconds:
- Since one revolution is \( 2\pi \) radians, for 5 revolutions in 30 seconds:
\( 5 \text{ rev} \times 2\pi \text{ rad/rev} = 10\pi \text{ rad/s} \)

Step 5: Calculate the total angle traveled in 30 seconds:
- Total angle = Angular speed × time
\( 10\pi \text{ rad/s} \times 30 \text{ s} = 300\pi \text{ rad} \)

Step 6: Convert the angle to linear distance:
- Distance traveled = Radius × Angle in radians
- Distance traveled = 10 cm × 300\pi \text{ rad}

Step 7: Calculate the final distance:
\( 10 \text{ cm} \times 300\pi \text{ rad} = 3000\pi \text{ cm} \)

The answer is (D) 3000π centimeters.

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:average wages, worker, 15 consecutive working days, $90 per day, first 7 days, $87 per day, last 7 days, $92 per day, wage on the 8th day.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How much total wages were earned during the entire 15-day period?
2. How much total wages were earned during the first 7 days?
3. How much total wages were earned during the last 7 days?
4. What is the sum of the wages on the first 7 days and the last 7 days?
5. How much did the worker earn on the 8th day to make the overall average $90 per day?

Step 3: Analyze the relationships between the pieces of information:
- The total wages for 15 days can be found by multiplying the average daily wage by the number of days.
- The wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days can be found similarly.
- The sum of the wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days should equal the total wages for the 15 days minus the wage on the 8th day.

Step 4: Calculate the missing wage:
Total wages for 15 days = Average wage per day * Number of days = $90/day * 15 days
Total wages for first 7 days = $87/day * 7 days
Total wages for last 7 days = $92/day * 7 days

Wage on the 8th day = Total wages for 15 days - (Total wages for first 7 days + Total wages for last 7 days)

Let's compute these values:
Total wages for 15 days = $90 * 15 = $1350
Total wages for first 7 days = $87 * 7 = $609
Total wages for last 7 days = $92 * 7 = $644

Wage on the 8th day = $1350 - ($609 + $644)
Wage on the 8th day = $1350 - $1253
Wage on the 8th day = $97

Step 5: Match the calculated wage with the answer choices:
The wage on the 8th day is $97, which corresponds to choice (D).

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Machine A, Machine B, yo-yo production, every 6 minutes, every 9 minutes, 10 yo-yos, find the time.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 
1. How many yo-yos does Machine A produce in 1 minute?
2. How many yo-yos does Machine B produce in 1 minute?
3. How many yo-yos do both machines produce together in 1 minute?
4. How many minutes does it take for Machine A to produce 10 yo-yos?
5. How many minutes does it take for Machine B to produce 10 yo-yos?
6. How many minutes will it take for both machines to produce a combined total of 10 yo-yos?

Step 3: Analyze and solve:
1. Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in 1 minute, it produces 1/6 yo-yos.
2. Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in 1 minute, it produces 1/9 yo-yos.
3. Together, they produce (1/6 + 1/9) yo-yos per minute. To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 18. So, Machine A produces 3/18 and Machine B produces 2/18, making their combined rate 5/18 yo-yos per minute.

4. Since Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, to produce 10 yo-yos, it would take 10 * 6 = 60 minutes.
5. For Machine B, to produce 10 yo-yos, it would take 10 * 9 = 90 minutes.

6. To find the time it takes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos together, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 60 (Machine A's time) and 90 (Machine B's time) because they will produce a yo-yo at the same time when their individual times align. The LCM of 60 and 90 is 180 minutes.

However, since we're looking for the time it takes for them to produce a combined total of 10 yo-yos, we need to consider that they produce 5/18 yo-yos per minute together. To get 10 yo-yos, we divide the total number of yo-yos by their combined rate: 10 / (5/18) = 10 * (18/5) = 36 minutes.

So, it will take 36 minutes for both machines to produce a combined total of 10 yo-yos.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Ram, Krishna, A, B, constant speeds, 20 m/s, 40 m/s, meet at point C, 10 seconds.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How far does Ram travel in 10 seconds?
2. How far does Krishna travel in 10 seconds?
3. Since they meet at point C, the sum of their distances must equal the total distance between A and B. How can we find this total distance?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. To find the distance Ram travels, multiply his speed by the time: \( Distance_{Ram} = Speed_{Ram} \times Time \).
2. Similarly, find the distance Krishna travels: \( Distance_{Krishna} = Speed_{Krishna} \times Time \).
3. The total distance between A and B is the sum of these two distances: \( Total\_Distance = Distance_{Ram} + Distance_{Krishna} \).

Now, let's calculate:

\( Distance_{Ram} = 20 \text{ m/s} \times 10 \text{ s} = 200 \text{ meters} \)
\( Distance_{Krishna} = 40 \text{ m/s} \times 10 \text{ s} = 400 \text{ meters} \)

The total distance between A and B is the sum of these two distances:

\( Total\_Distance = 200 \text{ meters} + 400 \text{ meters} = 600 \text{ meters} \)

So, the correct answer is (E) 600 meters.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Question:In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Railway station, two trains, harbor line, main line, frequency, 10 minutes, first train, probability, man arrives daily, first train.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the probability that the man will catch the first train if it follows a regular schedule?
2. How often does a train arrive at the station?
3. When does the first train of the harbor line depart?
4. When does the first train of the main line depart?
5. How much time does the man have to wait between the departure times of the first trains?

Step 3: Analyze the information:
- The frequency of each train is 10 minutes, which means a train arrives every 10 minutes.
- The main line service starts at 5:00 AM, and the harbor line starts at 5:02 AM.
- The man goes to the station every day to catch the first train.

Since the man arrives at the station just 2 minutes after the harbor line's first train departs, he will always miss that train. However, he might catch the first main line train if he arrives in time.

Step 4: Calculate the probability:
- The man has a 2-minute window to catch the first main line train, which is less than the 10-minute frequency.
- Therefore, the probability that he catches the first main line train is 2 minutes / 10 minutes = 0.2 or 20%.

Step 5: Answer choice:
The probability of the man catching the first train is 0.2, which corresponds to answer choice C (0.6).

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Question:A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Company contracts, 3 houses, Mr. Brown, 6 days, Mr. Black, 8 days, Mr. Blue, 12 days, after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, Mr. Black works for 6 days, Mr. Blue to complete the contract.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How much work does each person complete in one day?
2. How much work is done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black together in 8 days?
3. How much work is left after Mr. Brown leaves?
4. How much work does Mr. Black complete in 6 days?
5. How much work is left after Mr. Black finishes?
6. How long does it take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work?

Step 3: Analyze the steps:
1. Mr. Brown's rate: 1 house in 6 days => 1/6 house/day
   Mr. Black's rate: 1 house in 8 days => 1/8 house/day
   Mr. Blue's rate: 1 house in 12 days => 1/12 house/day

2. Work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days: 8 days * (1/6 house/day) = 4/3 houses
   Work done by Mr. Black in 8 days: 8 days * (1/8 house/day) = 1 house

3. Work left after Mr. Brown leaves: 3 houses - (4/3 houses) = 1 house (since Mr. Black already painted 1 house)

4. Work done by Mr. Black in 6 days: 6 days * (1/8 house/day) = 3/4 houses

5. Work left after Mr. Black finishes: 1 house - (3/4 houses) = 1/4 house

6. Time for Mr. Blue to paint the remaining 1/4 house: (1/4 house) / (1/12 house/day) = 1/4 * 12 days = 3 days

Mr. Blue will take an additional 3 days to complete the contract after Mr. Black finishes his part. So, the total time Mr. Blue will take is 8 days (initial time) + 3 days = 11 days.

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: cow, tethered, field, 14 feet rope, grazing area, 10 square feet per day, time to graze the whole field.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we calculate the area of the field that the cow can graze with a 14 feet rope?
2. If the cow grazes 10 square feet per day, how many days will it take to graze the entire field?
3. Is there any assumption or simplification needed for the calculation, like considering the shape of the field or the circular area that the cow can graze?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. The cow is tethered, so it can graze in a circular area around its position. The radius of this circle is half the length of the rope (7 feet). The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( A \) is the area and \( r \) is the radius.
2. We can find the total time by dividing the total area of the field by the area the cow grazes per day. If the cow grazes the entire field, the time will be the number of days it takes to graze 10 square feet per day for the entire area.
3. Assuming the field is a perfect circle and the cow can graze the grass evenly, we can calculate the area without needing to consider the shape of the field.

Step 4: Perform the calculation:
The area of the field \( A \) can be calculated as:
\[ A = \pi \times (7\text{ feet})^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 49 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for the cow to graze 10 square feet per day for this area:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\pi \times 49 \text{ square feet}}{10 \text{ square feet/day}} \]

We don't need to calculate the exact number of days because we are looking for an approximate answer. Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we can make a rough estimate by rounding up or down. 

\[ \text{Number of days} \approx \frac{3.14 \times 49}{10} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} \approx \frac{153.86}{10} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} \approx 15.386 \]

This is approximately 15 days, but we need to consider the answer choices, which are in whole days. The closest choice that is greater than 15 days is 16 days, which is closest to our estimated 15.386 days.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 16 days, which corresponds to the closest choice E) 91 days (as 16 days is a significant underestimate, and the question asks for an approximate time that is greater than the actual time).

Answer: E) 91 days

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars?
 Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Car 'X', distance 320 kms, 8 hours, Car 'Y', distance 415 kms, 5 hours, speed difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which car has a higher speed: Car 'X' or Car 'Y'?2. How far does Car 'X' travel per hour?3. What is the speed of Car 'X' in kilometers per hour?4. How far does Car 'Y' travel per hour?5. What is the speed of Car 'Y' in kilometers per hour?6. To find the speed difference, how many kilometers per hour does Car 'Y' travel more than Car 'X'?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After analyzing the given data, we can determine the speeds and distances traveled by both cars, Car 'X' and Car 'Y'. Unfortunately, no specific numerical values were provided for the speeds or distances. However, we can assume that if you have the necessary information, such as their respective speeds in miles per hour (mph) or meters per second (m/s), we can convert them into kilometers per hour (km/h) using the following conversions:1 mph = 1.60934 km/h1 m/s = 3.6 km/hTo compare the speeds, let's denote the speed of Car 'X' as \( V_X \) (in km/h) and the speed of Car 'Y' as \( V_Y \) (also in km/h). If \( V_X > V_Y \), then Car 'X' has a higher speed.For the distances traveled per hour, we would need the time traveled for each car to calculate the distance covered. Assuming they travel at constant speeds, the distance \( D_X \) for Car 'X' in one hour is \( V_X \) multiplied by the time, and similarly for Car 'Y', the distance \( D_Y \) is \( V_Y \) times the time.The speed difference between Car 'Y' and Car 'X' is calculated as \( |V_Y - V_X| \) (absolute value since we are only interested in the magnitude).Without the actual speeds, we cannot provide specific numbers for these calculations. However, if you provide the speeds or any other relevant data, we can easily perform the calculations and construct the passage accordingly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Train A, Mumbai Central, 11 am, 40 kmph, Train B, 2 pm, 72 kmph, meeting time, trains run along the same route.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How far is the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow?2. How far does Train A travel before Train B starts?3. How long does it take for Train B to catch up to Train A?4. How much time passes between Train A leaving and Train B catching up?5. When does Train B catch up to Train A?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
- To find the meeting time, we need to first determine the relative speed of the two trains (since they're moving in the same direction).
- We'll then calculate the distance Train A travels before Train B starts, which is the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow.
- After that, we'll find out how long it takes for Train B to cover that distance at its speed, which will be the time it takes for Train B to catch up to Train A.
- Finally, we'll add this time to the starting time of Train B (2 pm) to get the meeting time.

Since we don't have the actual distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow, we can't directly calculate the time it takes for Train B to catch up. However, we can make an assumption that if the trains were covering equal distances, the time it would take for Train B to catch up would be the ratio of their speeds. Since Train B is faster, it would catch up to Train A sooner.

Let's assume the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is \( D \) km. The relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is \( 72 - 40 = 32 \) kmph. If \( T \) is the time in hours Train B needs to catch up, we can write:

\[ D = 32T \]

Now, we need to find out how much time Train A travels before Train B starts. Since Train A leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm, there's a 3-hour gap. So, the distance Train A travels before Train B starts is:

\[ 40 \text{ kmph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ km} \]

If \( D = 120 \) km, then:

\[ 120 = 32T \]
\[ T = \frac{120}{32} \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{4} \]
\[ T = 3.75 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add this time to the starting time of Train B (2 pm):

\[ 2 \text{ pm} + 3.75 \text{ hours} = 5.75 \text{ pm} \]

Since 5.75 pm is not in the given answer choices, it means our assumption about the distance being equal to the time it takes for Train B to catch up might not be correct. However, without the actual distance, we cannot give a definitive answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E: None of these. We would need the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow to accurately determine the meeting time.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How can we calculate the percentage of the astronaut's weight on Earth that corresponds to their weight on Venus?2. Given the astronaut's weight on Earth is 211 pounds and their weight on Venus is 182 pounds, how do we set up the equation to find the percentage?3. Which answer choice best represents the result of the calculation?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- To find the percentage, we need to divide the weight on Venus by the weight on Earth and multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage.
- The equation would be: \( \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Weight on Venus}}{\text{Weight on Earth}} \right) \times 100\% \)
- Plugging in the values: \( \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{182}{211} \right) \times 100\% \)

Now let's calculate the percentage:

\( \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{182}{211} \right) \times 100\% \approx 0.86 \times 100\% = 86\% \)

The closest answer choice to 86% is (D) 86%.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:book, Rs 27.50, profit of 10%, Rs. 25.75, percentage of profit and loss..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation determines the cost price of the book based on the selling price and the given profit percentage?2. What percentage increase or decrease in the selling price would result in a 2% profit or 3% profit or loss if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75?3. Who are the parties involved in this situation - the seller, the buyer, and the profit or loss calculation?4. Where does the concept of break-even point come into play when calculating the profit or loss for the book at Rs. 25.75?5. When does the change in selling price from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75 affect the profitability of the sale?6. Why is it important to find the exact percentage of profit or loss for the book when sold at Rs. 25.75, given the initial profit of 10%?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a business transaction involving the sale of a book, the cost price (C.P.) can be determined using the selling price (S.P.) and the given profit percentage. The relationship between these values is governed by the formula for calculating profit: Profit = (S.P. - C.P.) / C.P. To find the cost price, one would use the formula C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit Percentage / 100). For instance, if the book is initially sold for Rs. 25.75 with a 10% profit, we can calculate the cost price as follows:C.P. = 25.75 / (1 + 10/100) = 25.75 / 1.10 ≈ Rs. 23.41Now, let's consider the impact of a percentage change in the selling price on the profit or loss. If the book needs to generate a 2% profit at the new selling price, we would have:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 2/100) = 25.75 * 1.02 ≈ Rs. 26.26Similarly, for a 3% profit:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 3/100) = 25.75 * 1.03 ≈ Rs. 26.68On the other hand, for a 3% loss:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 - 3/100) = 25.75 * 0.97 ≈ Rs. 24.71The parties involved in this scenario are the seller, who sets the cost price and aims to make a profit, and the buyer, who purchases the book at the selling price. The concept of the break-even point comes into play when the profit margin is zero, which doesn't apply directly to the given Rs. 25.75 but serves as a reference for understanding when the seller neither makes nor loses money.When the selling price changes from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75, it reduces the potential profit because the higher initial price would have allowed for a larger margin. The profitability of the sale is affected negatively as the difference between the selling price and the cost price shrinks.Lastly, finding the exact percentage of profit or loss when the book is sold at Rs. 25.75 is crucial because it provides an accurate assessment of the business performance. Without this figure, it would be difficult to gauge the efficiency of the pricing strategy or make informed decisions about future pricing or production levels.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: grocer, 25% profit, selling price per bag ($100), total profit ($3,000), number of bags sold.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the cost price per bag if the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price?
2. How much profit does the grocer make on one bag of flour?
3. If the grocer makes a total profit of $3,000 from selling bags, how many bags must have been sold at the selling price of $100 each?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. To find the cost price per bag, we can use the formula: Cost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Percentage). So, Cost Price = $100 / (1 + 0.25).
2. The profit per bag is the selling price minus the cost price: Profit per Bag = Selling Price - Cost Price.
3. To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag: Number of Bags Sold = Total Profit / Profit per Bag.

Step 4: Calculate the cost price and profit per bag:
- Cost Price = $100 / (1 + 0.25) = $100 / 1.25 = $80.

Step 5: Calculate the profit per bag:
- Profit per Bag = $100 - $80 = $20.

Step 6: Calculate the number of bags sold:
- Number of Bags Sold = $3,000 / $20 = 150.

Since the answer choices are not in the correct format (no option for 150), we need to check if any of the options are closest to 150. The closest option is (D) 30, which is less than 150. However, since the profit per bag is $20 and the total profit is $3,000, selling 30 bags would result in a profit of 30 * $20 = $600, which is significantly less than the given $3,000.

The correct answer should be closer to 150, so we need to look for the next closest multiple of 100 that gives a profit of $3,000. We can quickly check the next option, which is (E) 40 bags. If the grocer sells 40 bags, the profit would be 40 * $20 = $800, which is still less than $3,000.

However, we can continue this process by checking the next multiple of 100 after 40, which is 50 bags. If the grocer sells 50 bags, the profit would be 50 * $20 = $1,000, which is more than $3,000. This means we've gone too far and the correct answer should be between 30 and 40.

Given the options, there is no exact match for the number of bags sold, but we can choose the closest option that would result in a profit close to $3,000. Since 30 bags give us $600 and 40 bags give us $800, the best choice is to round down to 30 bags, as it's the lower bound that's closer to the actual number.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given that the price of a product is reduced by 30%. We need to find the percentage increase required to bring the price back to 100% of its original value.

Step 2: Set up the equation
Let \( P \) be the original price of the product. After a 30% reduction, the new price is \( P - 0.30P = 0.70P \). We want to find the percentage increase \( x \) needed to get back to the original price, so we have:
\[ 0.70P + (x \cdot 0.70P) = P \]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Substitute \( P \) with \( 1 \) (since we're looking for the percentage increase relative to the original price):
\[ 0.70 + 0.70x = 1 \]
Now solve for \( x \):
\[ 0.70x = 1 - 0.70 \]
\[ 0.70x = 0.30 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.30}{0.70} \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{70} \]
\[ x = \frac{3}{7} \]

Step 4: Convert to percentage
To convert the decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100:
\[ x = \frac{3}{7} \times 100 \]
\[ x = 42.857... \]

Step 5: Choose the closest answer choice
The closest answer choice is (B) 42.86%.

What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:book, Rs 27.50, profit of 10%, Rs. 25.75, percentage of profit and loss..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation determines the cost price of the book based on the selling price and the given profit percentage?2. What percentage increase or decrease in the selling price would result in a 2% profit or 3% profit or loss if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75?3. Who are the parties involved in this situation - the seller, the buyer, and the profit or loss calculation?4. Where does the concept of break-even point come into play when calculating the profit or loss for the book at Rs. 25.75?5. When does the change in selling price from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75 affect the profitability of the sale?6. Why is it important to find the exact percentage of profit or loss for the book when sold at Rs. 25.75, given the initial profit of 10%?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a business transaction involving the sale of a book, the cost price (C.P.) can be determined using the selling price (S.P.) and the given profit percentage. The relationship between these values is governed by the formula for calculating profit: Profit = (S.P. - C.P.) / C.P. To find the cost price, one would use the formula C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit Percentage / 100). For instance, if the book is initially sold for Rs. 25.75 with a 10% profit, we can calculate the cost price as follows:C.P. = 25.75 / (1 + 10/100) = 25.75 / 1.10 ≈ Rs. 23.41Now, let's consider the impact of a percentage change in the selling price on the profit or loss. If the book needs to generate a 2% profit at the new selling price, we would have:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 2/100) = 25.75 * 1.02 ≈ Rs. 26.26Similarly, for a 3% profit:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 3/100) = 25.75 * 1.03 ≈ Rs. 26.68On the other hand, for a 3% loss:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 - 3/100) = 25.75 * 0.97 ≈ Rs. 24.71The parties involved in this scenario are the seller, who sets the cost price and aims to make a profit, and the buyer, who purchases the book at the selling price. The concept of the break-even point comes into play when the profit margin is zero, which doesn't apply directly to the given Rs. 25.75 but serves as a reference for understanding when the seller neither makes nor loses money.When the selling price changes from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75, it reduces the potential profit because the higher initial price would have allowed for a larger margin. The profitability of the sale is affected negatively as the difference between the selling price and the cost price shrinks.Lastly, finding the exact percentage of profit or loss when the book is sold at Rs. 25.75 is crucial because it provides an accurate assessment of the business performance. Without this figure, it would be difficult to gauge the efficiency of the pricing strategy or make informed decisions about future pricing or production levels.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain.

Question:Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Last year, Ace Book Company, sales revenue, 34% novels, remaining revenue, 1/3 biographies, ratio of novel to biography revenue.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much revenue came from biographies if 34% came from novels?2. What is the remaining revenue after accounting for the novels?3. How much of the remaining revenue is from biographies?4. How do we calculate the ratio of novel revenue to biography revenue?5. Which answer choice corresponds to the calculated ratio?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- Since 34% of the revenue came from novels, the remaining 66% must be from other categories, including biographies.
- 1/3 of the remaining revenue is from biographies, so we need to find 1/3 of 66%.
- Once we have the percentages for novels and biographies, we can calculate the ratio by dividing the percentage of novel revenue by the percentage of biography revenue.

Let's do the calculations:

- Remaining revenue after novels: 100% - 34% = 66%
- Revenue from biographies: 1/3 of 66% = (1/3) * 66 = 22%

Now, we calculate the ratio of novel revenue to biography revenue:

Ratio = (Novel Revenue / Biography Revenue) = (34% / 22%)

Converting both percentages to the same denominator (for example, 100):

Ratio = (34 / 100) / (22 / 100) = 34 / 22

Now, we simplify the fraction:

Ratio = 17 / 11 ≈ 1.53846

The answer choices closest to this value are (B) 1.5.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 1.5.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Question:Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Jack, 18 sharpeners, white and brown, total cost Rs. 100, price difference for white sharpeners, need to find the number of white and brown sharpeners.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we set up an equation to represent the situation?
2. What is the relationship between the price of a white sharpener and a brown sharpener?
3. How can we use the total cost and the price difference to find the number of white and brown sharpeners?
4. Are there any constraints or conditions that might limit the possible combinations of white and brown sharpeners?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. We can set up an equation using two variables, let W be the number of white sharpeners and B be the number of brown sharpeners. The total number of sharpeners is 18, so W + B = 18. We also know that the total cost is Rs. 100, and each white sharpener costs Rs. 1 more than a brown sharpener, so the cost can be represented as 100 = W*(W+1) + B*W.
2. The price difference is 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than brown, so the price of a white sharpener is B + 1.
3. To solve this system of equations, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to eliminate one variable and find the value of W, then use that to find B.
4. There are no constraints mentioned other than the total number of sharpeners and the price difference, so we can proceed with solving the equations.

Now let's solve the system of equations:

100 = W*(W+1) + B*W
Since W + B = 18, we can substitute W = 18 - B into the equation:
100 = (18 - B)*(18 - B + 1) + B*(18 - B)

Solving for B will give us the number of brown sharpeners, and then we can find the number of white sharpeners (W).

Let's solve for B:

100 = (18 - B)(19 - B) + B(18 - B)
100 = 342 - 36B + B^2 - B^2 + 18B
100 = 342 - 18B

Now, solve for B:

-18B = 342 - 100
-18B = 242
B = 242 / -18
B ≈ -13.44

However, since the number of sharpeners cannot be negative, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices. The price difference condition doesn't seem to match the given total cost and number of sharpeners. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of white and brown sharpeners based on the information provided.

Answer: There is likely an error in the question or answer choices, as the calculated number of brown sharpeners is negative. Without a correct solution, we cannot choose an answer from the given options.

To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: subscription, 15 issues, $42.00, 25% saving, cover price per issue.
Step 2: Identify the relationship between the given data: We are told that the subscription price represents a saving of 25% on the cover price. This means that the subscription price is 75% of the cover price because 100% - 25% = 75%.
Step 3: Set up the equation: Let \( x \) be the cover price per issue. The subscription price for 15 issues is 15 times the cover price per issue, which is 75% of the cover price per issue. So we can write:
\[ 15x \times 0.75 = $42.00 \]

Step 4: Solve for \( x \):
\[ 11.25x = $42.00 \]
\[ x = \frac{42.00}{11.25} \]
\[ x = $3.73 \]

Step 5: Match the calculated cover price with the answer choices: The cover price per issue is $3.73, which corresponds to answer choice E.

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 270 (B) 300 (C) 280 (D) 320 (E) 315
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Trader, 20% profit, selling price (Rs.360), cost price.
Step 2: Identify the relationship: We need to find the cost price (CP) of the article, given that the trader made a 20% profit on it and the selling price is Rs.360.
Step 3: Set up the equation: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
We know that the profit is 20% of the cost price, so we can write:
Profit = CP * 20/100

Given that Profit = Rs.360, we can substitute this into the equation:
360 = CP * 20/100

Step 4: Solve for the cost price:
To find the cost price, we'll isolate CP by dividing both sides of the equation by 20/100 (which simplifies to 0.20):
CP = 360 / 0.20

Now, let's do the calculation:
CP = 360 / 0.20 = 1800

Step 5: Choose the correct answer from the given choices: Since the cost price is Rs.1800, we need to find the closest choice that matches this value. The closest choice is Rs.300, which is option B.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000? Answer Choices: (A) 81900 (B) 85995 (C) 85800 (D) 90000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: population, city, annual increase, current population, 2 years, percentage increase.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the formula to calculate the population after a certain number of years with a given annual percentage increase?2. How do we apply this formula to find the population after 2 years with a 5% increase?3. Given the current population of 78,000, what will be the population after a 5% increase each year for 2 years?4. Which answer choice corresponds to the calculated population after 2 years?
Step 3: Analyze the questions:
- The formula to calculate population after n years with a given annual percentage increase (r) is: \( P_{n} = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \), where \( P_0 \) is the initial population and \( P_n \) is the population after n years.
- For our problem, \( P_0 = 78,000 \), r = 5% (or 0.05 as a decimal), and n = 2 years.
- Plugging these values into the formula, we get \( P_2 = 78,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^2 \).
- Calculate the result to find the population after 2 years.

Now let's perform the calculation:

\( P_2 = 78,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^2 \)
\( P_2 = 78,000 \times (1.05)^2 \)
\( P_2 = 78,000 \times 1.1025 \)
\( P_2 ≈ 85,995 \)

Step 4: Compare the calculated value with the answer choices:
- The closest answer choice is (B) 85,995.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 85,995.

Input:
Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Understand the problem - We need to find the total discount when the manufacturer offers a 20% discount and the retailer adds another 20% on top of that.

Step 2: Calculate the manufacturer's discount - If the manufacturer offers a 20% discount, the customer will pay 80% of the original price because 100% - 20% = 80%.

Step 3: Calculate the retailer's discount - If the retailer offers an additional 20% on top of the manufacturer's discount, they are effectively discounting 80% of the original price. So, the retailer's discount is 20% of 80%.

Step 4: Calculate the total discount - To find the total discount, we add the two discounts together: Manufacturer's Discount + Retailer's Discount.

Let's do the math:

- Manufacturer's Discount = 20% (of the original price)
- Retailer's Discount = 20% (of 80% of the original price)

Total Discount = 20% + 20% of 80%

Total Discount = 20% + 0.20 * 80%

Total Discount = 20% + 16%

Total Discount = 36%

So, the total discount available at the retailer is 36%.

The correct answer is (E) 36%.

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:company, 420 units, production cost per component, $110, minimum selling price per component, yearly profit, $626,400.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the monthly profit from sales if the company sells all 420 components?2. How much does the company spend on production costs for all components in a year?3. What is the formula to determine the total revenue needed for a yearly profit of at least $626,400?4. Given the production cost per component, how many times must the minimum selling price cover this cost to meet the yearly profit goal?5. In what timeframe does the company need to achieve this profit (yearly)?6. How much profit per component is required to guarantee the minimum yearly profit of $626,400?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the monthly profit from sales, we first need to determine the profit per component. Assuming a fixed profit margin, let's denote the selling price per component as SP, the production cost per component as PC, and the desired profit per component as P. The monthly profit from selling all 420 components can be calculated using the formula:\[ \text{Monthly Profit} = 420 \times (\text{SP} - \text{PC}) \]For the annual production costs, we multiply the number of components by the production cost per component:\[ \text{Annual Production Costs} = 420 \times \text{PC} \times 12 \]To ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we can set up an equation using the revenue formula:\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Components} \times \text{(SP + Profit per Component)} \]Rearranging for the profit per component:\[ \text{Profit per Component} = \frac{\text{Yearly Profit Goal}}{\text{Number of Components}} \]Plugging in the given value:\[ \text{Profit per Component} = \frac{626,400}{420} \]The timeframe to achieve this profit is a yearly basis, as specified.To find out how many times the minimum selling price must cover the production cost to meet the yearly profit goal, we divide the total revenue by the number of components and the production cost:\[ \text{Minimum Selling Price Coverage} = \frac{\text{Yearly Profit Goal}}{\text{Number of Components} \times \text{PC}} \]By combining all these calculations, we can create a passage that outlines the process:To calculate the monthly profit from sales, we use the formula \( 420 \times (\text{Selling Price} - \text{Production Cost}) \), where 420 is the number of components sold each month. For the annual production costs, it's \( 420 \times \text{PC} \times 12 \) with PC being the cost per component. To guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we rearrange the revenue formula to find the profit per component as \( \frac{626,400}{420} \). To meet the profit goal, the minimum selling price needs to cover the production cost at least \( \frac{626,400}{420 \times \text{PC}} \) times. This profit per component will ensure a minimum yearly profit of $626,400, and the goal is to achieve this within a one-year timeframe.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? Answer Choices: (A) $50000 (B) $40000 (C) $30000 (D) $20000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: shop assistant, monthly salary, fixed salary, 5%, monthly sales, $500, $1500.
Step 2: Identify the relationship: The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary ($500) and 5% of the monthly sales. We need to find the monthly sales that would result in a total salary of $1500.

Let's denote the monthly sales as \( X \) (in dollars). According to the problem, the salary can be expressed as:
\[ S = 500 + 0.05X \]

We are given that \( S = 1500 \), so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05X \]

Now, solve for \( X \):

\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05X \]
\[ 1000 = 0.05X \]
\[ X = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]
\[ X = 20000 \]

So, the monthly sales should be $20,000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.

The correct answer is (D) $20000.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 24 (C) 25 (D) 40 (E) 52
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: salesperson, commission rate, $1000 salary, $250 sales, minimum number of sales needed.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the commission amount for each $250 sale?
2. How much commission does the salesperson need to earn to reach a salary of $1000?
3. How many $250 sales are required to earn this commission amount, given the 10% commission rate?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. Commission per $250 sale = 10% of $250 = 0.10 * $250
2. Total commission needed = $1000 (salary goal)
3. Number of sales needed = Total commission needed / Commission per sale

Let's calculate the commission per sale and then determine the number of sales needed:

Commission per sale = 0.10 * $250 = $25

Now, we'll divide the total salary goal by the commission per sale to find the number of sales:

Number of sales needed = $1000 / $25 = 40

So, the salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 40.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: pen company, defective pens, delivered pens, profit, manufactured cost per pen.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many non-defective pens will the company produce to meet the promised delivery of 7200 pens?
2. What is the total revenue from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each?
3. Calculate the total cost of producing 7200 pens, considering 10% are defective and the company wants a 25% overall profit.
4. From the total cost, how much is the cost per non-defective pen, which is the manufactured cost?
Step 3: Analyze these new questions:
1. Since 10% of the pens are defective, we can calculate the number of non-defective pens as follows:
   Non-defective pens = Total pens delivered / (1 - Defect rate)
   Non-defective pens = 7200 / (1 - 0.10)

2. Total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of delivered pens by the selling price:
   Total Revenue = Number of delivered pens * Selling price per pen
   Total Revenue = 7200 * 10

3. The total cost includes the cost of producing the non-defective pens and the cost of producing the defective pens. Since the company wants a 25% profit, the total cost should be:
   Total Cost = Total Revenue / (1 + Profit margin)
   Total Cost = (7200 * 10) / (1 + 0.25)

4. To find the manufactured cost per non-defective pen, we divide the total cost by the number of non-defective pens:
   Manufactured Cost per Non-Defective Pen = Total Cost / Non-defective pens

Step 4: Perform the calculations:
1. Non-defective pens = 7200 / 0.90 = 8000 pens
2. Total Revenue = 7200 * 10 = 72000
3. Total Cost = 72000 / 1.25 = 57600
4. Manufactured Cost per Non-Defective Pen = 57600 / 8000

Step 5: Calculate the manufactured cost per non-defective pen:
Manufactured Cost per Non-Defective Pen = 57600 / 8000 = 7.2

So, the manufactured cost of each non-defective pen is Rs. 7.2.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, rows, rate, 4 kmph, still water, rate against the current, 2 kmph, rate along the current.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the man's speed in still water if he rows at 4 kmph?2. What is the formula to calculate the speed of an object moving against the current, given the man's rowing speed and his speed against the current?3. Who is the subject of the problem, and what is their action that affects the calculation of the rate along the current?4. In what situation does the man's rate against the current play a role in determining his rate along the current?5. When would you need to consider both the man's speed in still water and his speed against the current to find the rate along the current?6. How can you combine the given rates (4 kmph and 2 kmph) to determine the man's speed along the current?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The problem revolves around a man who is rowing a boat. To find his speed in still water, we can use the basic formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. However, since the question doesn't provide specific distances, we'll assume that his rowing speed of 4 kmph represents his constant speed in calm waters without any external factors.To calculate the man's speed when rowing against the current, we need to consider the combined effect of his rowing effort and the river's flow. The formula for this is:Speed against the current = Rowing speed - Speed of the currentHowever, the speed of the current is not given in the problem. Let's denote it as 'C' kmph. If the man rows at 4 kmph and his speed against the current is 2 kmph, we can deduce that:2 kmph = 4 kmph - CSolving for C, we get:C = 4 kmph - 2 kmphC = 2 kmphNow, to find the man's speed along the current, we use the same formula but with the speed of the current added to his rowing speed:Speed along the current = Rowing speed + Speed of the currentSpeed along the current = 4 kmph + 2 kmphSpeed along the current = 6 kmphIn this case, the man's rate against the current (2 kmph) plays a role when determining his rate along the current because it accounts for the resistance caused by the flow of the water. When the man's speed in still water (4 kmph) and his speed against the current are both known, as they are here, you can directly combine them to find the rate along the current without needing additional context or conditions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: average weight, 10 oarsmen, boat, increased by 1.8 kg, one crew member's weight, 53 kg, new man's weight.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 
1. How can we find the total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement?
2. What is the relationship between the total weight before and after the replacement?
3. How can we calculate the total weight increase due to the replacement?
4. How can we find the weight of the new man based on the total weight increase?

Step 3: Analyze the relationships:
- Total weight before replacement = Average weight of 10 oarsmen * Number of oarsmen
- Total weight after replacement = Total weight before replacement + Weight of the new man
- Increase in weight = Weight of the replaced crew member - Weight of the new man
- Given: Increase in weight = 1.8 kg

Step 4: Use the relationships to find the answer:
Let the average weight of the 10 oarsmen be \( x \) kg. So, the total weight before replacement is \( 10x \) kg.

The new total weight after replacing the 53 kg crew member with a new man is \( 10x + 1.8 \) kg.

From the relationships, we can set up the equation:
\[ 10x + 1.8 = 10x + (53 - weight of the new man) \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 1.8 = 53 - weight of the new man \]
\[ weight of the new man = 53 - 1.8 \]

Now, calculate the weight of the new man:
\[ weight of the new man = 51.2 \]

However, none of the answer choices match our calculated value. There seems to be an error in the question or the answer choices provided. The correct answer should be 51.2 kg, which is not listed among the options. If the question is correct, there might be a misprint in the answer choices, and the closest option would be E (40 kg), but that is not the correct answer either.

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) s.5050 (B) s.5723 (C) s.5040 (D) s.4950 (E) s.4870
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: discount of 20%, purchase price of Rs.4578, actual selling price.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the formula to calculate the original price before the discount when given the discounted price and the discount percentage?2. How do we find the original price if the discounted price is Rs.4578 and the discount is 20%?3. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the original selling price before the discount was applied?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
1. The formula to find the original price \( P \) before the discount when the discounted price \( D \) and the discount percentage \( d \) are known is:
\[ P = \frac{D}{1 - \frac{d}{100}} \]

2. We need to apply this formula to find the original price. Given:
\[ D = 4578 \]
\[ d = 20\% = 0.20 \]
\[ P = \frac{4578}{1 - 0.20} \]

3. We'll calculate the original price and then compare it to the answer choices to find the correct one.

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ P = \frac{4578}{1 - 0.20} = \frac{4578}{0.80} = 4578 \times \frac{100}{80} = 4578 \times 1.25 \]

\[ P = 5722.5 \]

Since the answer choices are not in Rupees, we should round to the nearest whole number because the actual selling price cannot be a fraction of a rupee.

The closest answer choice to 5722.5 is (B) Rs.5723.

Answer: B) Rs.5723

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: employees, company, winter vacation, summer vacation, percentages, Q percent, summer vacation only.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the total percentage of employees who take at least one vacation (winter or summer)?
2. How many employees take both vacations (winter and summer)?
3. What is the percentage of employees who take neither vacation?
4. To find Q, we need to subtract the percentages of employees who take both vacations and neither vacation from the total employees who take a summer vacation.
Step 3: Analyze the given information:
- 75% take a winter vacation
- 40% take both winter and summer vacations
- 20% take neither vacation

Since 40% take both vacations, they are counted in both the winter and summer vacation groups. We need to subtract this overlap to find the true percentage of summer vacation-only employees.

Total employees taking at least one vacation = Winter vacationers + Summer vacationers - Both (Winter and Summer)
Total employees taking at least one vacation = 75% + (Summer vacationers - Both)

We know that 40% are both, so:
Total employees taking at least one vacation = 75% + (Summer vacationers - 40%)

Since 20% take neither vacation, the remaining percentage must be taking summer vacation only:
Summer vacationers only = Total employees taking at least one vacation - (Employees taking both) - (Employees taking neither)

Now we can set up the equation for Q, which represents the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:
Q = (Summer vacationers - 40%) - 20%

To find Q, we need to express "Summer vacationers" in terms of the given percentages. Let's solve for "Summer vacationers":
Summer vacationers = Total employees taking at least one vacation + 40% (since they're both)

Now substitute the known percentages:
Summer vacationers = (75% + (Summer vacationers - 40%)) + 40%

Solving for "Summer vacationers":
Summer vacationers = 75% + 40% + (Summer vacationers - 40%)
Summer vacationers = 115% + (Summer vacationers - 40%)
Summer vacationers - Summer vacationers = 115% - 40%
Summer vacationers = 75%

Now we can find Q:
Q = (75% - 40%) - 20%
Q = 35% - 20%
Q = 15%

So, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Understand the problem
The shopkeeper initially offers a 20% discount on all items. He needs to recover the original price by increasing the discounted price by some percentage on the next day.

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price
Let's denote the original price as \( P \). After a 20% discount, the price becomes:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = P - (0.20 \times P) = 0.80 \times P \]

Step 3: Determine the required percentage increase
To recover the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase the discounted price by \( x \% \). The new price after the increase would be:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Discounted Price} + (\text{Discounted Price} \times \frac{x}{100}) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 0.80 \times P + (0.80 \times P \times \frac{x}{100}) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = P \]

We want to find \( x \) such that:
\[ 0.80 \times P + (0.80 \times P \times \frac{x}{100}) = P \]

Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract \( 0.80 \times P \) from both sides:
\[ 0.80 \times P \times \frac{x}{100} = P - 0.80 \times P \]
\[ 0.80 \times P \times \frac{x}{100} = 0.20 \times P \]

Now, divide both sides by \( 0.80 \times P \):
\[ \frac{x}{100} = \frac{0.20 \times P}{0.80 \times P} \]
\[ \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Step 5: Choose the correct answer
The shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25% to get back to the original price.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 25%.

Input:
Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: mixture, 10 kg, 30% sand, 70% clay, equal quantities of clay and sand, remove and replace with pure sand.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much sand and clay are currently in the mixture?2. What is the required final quantity of each component (sand and clay)?3. How much sand and clay needs to be added to reach the required final quantity?4. How much of the original mixture should be removed to maintain the same total weight after replacement?5. How much pure sand should be added to replace the removed mixture?
Step 3: Analyze the situation:
- Current sand: 10 kg * 30% = 3 kg
- Current clay: 10 kg * 70% = 7 kg
- Required final quantity of sand and clay: 5 kg each (equal)
- Let x kg of the mixture be removed and replaced with pure sand. The remaining mixture will have (10 - x) kg.
- The new mixture will have (3 - (x * 30%)) kg of sand and (7 - (x * 70%)) kg of clay.

Since we want equal quantities of sand and clay, we set up the equation:
\[ 3 - (x * 30\%) = 7 - (x * 70\%) \]

Now solve for x:
\[ 3 - 0.3x = 7 - 0.7x \]
\[ 0.7x - 0.3x = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 0.4x = 4 \]
\[ x = \frac{4}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

This means 10 kg of the mixture needs to be removed. Since the mixture weighs 10 kg, the entire mixture must be replaced with pure sand.

Step 4: Answer the question:
The amount of the mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand is the entire 10 kg.

However, since the answer choices are not in terms of the fraction of the mixture but rather the fraction of the weight, we can express 10 kg as a fraction of the original 10 kg mixture:

\[ \frac{10}{10} = 1 \]

None of the given choices match this result, which indicates that the answer choices might be incorrect or the question might be flawed. If the question were asking for the fraction of the mixture to be removed, the correct answer would be 10/10 or 1, not a fraction of the weight.

Given the options, the closest answer seems to be (E) 50/7, which could be a misinterpretation or error in the question. Without further clarification, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer based on the provided choices.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: total amount to be raised, equal contribution per employee, additional contribution, revised total amount, number of employees.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How much was the original contribution per employee, and how much was the target contribution per employee?
2. How much was the total difference in contributions when each employee gave Rs. 60 extra?
3. How many employees would there be if each contributed the target amount?
4. How many employees are there if each contributed the original amount, and the total raised was Rs. 6 lakh?
5. How can we find the number of employees using the information provided?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. The original contribution per employee is the total amount divided by the number of employees, and the target contribution per employee is the original amount plus Rs. 60.
2. The total difference in contributions is Rs. 60 per employee multiplied by the number of employees.
3. If each employee contributed the target amount, the number of employees would be the revised total amount divided by the target contribution per employee.
4. Since the original total amount is Rs. 6 lakh, we can find the number of employees by dividing 6,00,000 by the original contribution per employee.
5. We can set up an equation using the information from steps 1 and 2 to find the number of employees: Original contribution per employee + 60 = Target contribution per employee, and the total amount raised = Number of employees * Original contribution per employee.

Let the original contribution per employee be \( x \) rupees. Then, the target contribution per employee is \( x + 60 \) rupees. The total amount raised is 6,00,000 rupees.

From the problem, we have:
\( x \times \text{Number of employees} = 6,00,000 \)
\( (x + 60) \times \text{Number of employees} = 6,24,000 \)

Now, we can equate the two expressions to find the number of employees:
\( x \times \text{Number of employees} = (x + 60) \times \text{Number of employees} - 60 \times \text{Number of employees} \)

Step 4: Solve for the number of employees:
\( 60 \times \text{Number of employees} = 6,24,000 - 6,00,000 \)
\( 60 \times \text{Number of employees} = 24,000 \)
\( \text{Number of employees} = \frac{24,000}{60} \)
\( \text{Number of employees} = 400 \)

So, there are 400 employees in the organization.

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Home Appliance Store, average, microwave ovens, per month, last year, 42, first 10 months, this year, 20, arithmetic mean, entire 22 months period..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the average calculation require to find out the monthly sales of microwaves last year?2. What is the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year according to the average provided?3. Who or what entity is being measured in terms of microwave oven sales in this problem?4. In which timeframe are the sales from the first 10 months of this year being considered?5. When did the change in sales pattern occur, from last year to this year?6. How can we calculate the average sales of microwaves for the entire 22-month period to answer the original question?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the monthly sales of microwaves for the last year, one would need to perform an average calculation. This requires summing up the sales figures for each month and dividing that total by the number of months in the year, typically 12. According to the provided average, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year amounts to the average multiplied by the number of months, which can be calculated as:Total sales (last year) = Average sales per month * 12The entity being measured in terms of microwave oven sales in this problem is the quantity or units sold, which could represent individual appliances. The first 10 months of this year's sales are considered within the timeframe from January to October.A change in sales pattern occurred when comparing the sales from the last year to the current year, potentially indicating a shift starting from November or December of the previous year, marking the beginning of the new trend.To calculate the average sales of microwaves for the entire 22-month period (assuming the first 12 months are from the previous year and the next 10 from the current year), you would again take the sum of sales for both sets of months and divide by 22:Average sales (22 months) = (Sum of sales from last year + Sum of sales from current year's first 10 months) / 22By following these steps and using the given data, we can arrive at accurate answers for the annual and extended period sales averages. However, without specific numbers for the average sales per month or the total sales, the calculations cannot be performed here.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
 Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:exam, class, average (arithmetic mean), highest score, lowest score, x, average score for the entire class, y, number of students, z, excluding, highest and lowest scorers..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the average of the highest and lowest scores in the problem?2. What is the formula to calculate the average of the entire class, given the sum and the number of students?3. Who are the two scores being excluded when calculating the average for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?4. In what context does the problem occur - a single exam or multiple exams?5. When does the exclusion of the highest and lowest scores take place - before or after determining the overall class average?6. Why is it necessary to exclude the highest and lowest scores when finding the new average?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the problem at hand, the process of finding the average involves several steps. To determine the average of the highest and lowest scores, one would typically use the arithmetic mean operation. This method requires adding the two scores together and then dividing by the count of scores, which is 2 in this case.To calculate the overall class average, given the sum of all scores (let's denote it as S) and the number of students (N), the formula is:Average_class = S / NWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores from the class average, we are looking at a different scenario. Let's assume the sum of scores excluding the top and bottom scores is denoted as S' and there are (N-2) students left. The new average, known as the median average, can be calculated using the following formula:New_average = S' / (N - 2)This exclusion occurs in the context of multiple exams or assignments, where outliers like exceptional performances or extreme difficulties might skew the overall grade distribution. By removing these scores, the new average provides a more representative measure of the typical performance for the majority of students.The exclusion of the highest and lowest scores takes place after determining the initial overall class average, but before computing the median average. The rationale behind this exclusion is to mitigate the influence of any extreme values that might not accurately reflect the typical student performance. This ensures a more balanced and fair assessment of the students' abilities.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: average weight, 10 vehicles, 12.2 tons, average increased by 2.6 tons, new heavy duty truck, find weight of the truck.

Step 2: Decompose the question into smaller parts:
1. Calculate the total weight of the 10 vehicles initially.
2. Determine the new average weight after adding the heavy duty truck.
3. Find the difference between the new average and the old average, which represents the weight of the truck.
4. Use this difference to find the weight of the heavy duty truck.

Step 3: Apply the formulas and solve:
1. Total weight of 10 vehicles = Average weight * Number of vehicles
   Total weight = 12.2 tons * 10
   Total weight = 122 tons

2. New average weight = Old average + Increase in average
   New average = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons
   New average = 14.8 tons

3. Weight of the heavy duty truck = Difference between new average and old average
   Weight of truck = New average - Old average
   Weight of truck = 14.8 tons - 12.2 tons
   Weight of truck = 2.6 tons

However, the weight of the truck is given in tons, so we don't need to multiply by any conversion factor.

Step 4: Match the calculated weight with the answer choices:
The weight of the heavy duty truck is 2.6 tons, which corresponds to answer choice (A) 40.8.

It seems there might be a mistake in the answer choices, as 2.6 tons is not represented among them. If the question is correct as stated, the correct answer should be 2.6 tons, which is not listed. Please double-check the question or the answer choices provided.

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At my favorite fruit stand, an orange costs 18 dollars, a pineapple costs 27 dollars, and a grape costs 15 dollars. Using the same logic, can you tell how much a mango costs? Answer Choices: (A) 22 dollars (B) 15 dollars (C) 20 dollars (D) 18 dollars (E) 10 dollars
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the pattern or logic in the given prices.
The given prices are not directly related to each other, so there's no clear arithmetic progression or ratio that can be used to determine the cost of a mango based on the information provided.

Step 2: Consider if there's any additional context or clue.
There is no additional context provided to suggest that the prices follow a specific rule or pattern.

Step 3: Since there's no direct relationship between the prices, we cannot use the same logic to determine the cost of a mango. The answer choices do not provide any information about the relationship between the prices either.

Conclusion: Without more information or a pattern to follow, we cannot accurately determine the cost of a mango based on the given data. Therefore, the answer is (E) 10 dollars, as it is the only option without a clear connection to the other fruit prices. However, it's important to note that this is a guess based on the lack of information, and the correct answer could be any of the other options if there was a hidden pattern.

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Alloy X, ratio of zinc to copper (6:9), alloy Y, ratio of zinc to copper (7:11), 40 grams of X, 60 grams of Y, alloy Z, ratio of zinc to copper in Z.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How much zinc and copper are there in 40 grams of alloy X?
2. How much zinc and copper are there in 60 grams of alloy Y?
3. How do we combine the zinc and copper from X and Y to find the ratio in alloy Z?
4. How do we express the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z in the format of the answer choices?

Step 3: Analyze and solve the new questions:
1. To find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X, we need to convert the ratio (6:9) into a total amount for 1 part (which is the least common multiple of 6 and 9). The least common multiple is 18. So, for every 18 parts, there are 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper. Therefore, in 40 grams of X:
   - Zinc = \( \frac{6}{18} \times 40 \) grams
   - Copper = \( \frac{9}{18} \times 40 \) grams

2. Similarly, for 60 grams of alloy Y:
   - Zinc = \( \frac{7}{18} \times 60 \) grams
   - Copper = \( \frac{11}{18} \times 60 \) grams

3. When we mix 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y, we add the amounts of zinc and copper together:
   - Total zinc in Z = Zinc in X + Zinc in Y
   - Total copper in Z = Copper in X + Copper in Y

4. Now, we need to express the ratio of zinc to copper in Z as a ratio. We can simplify the ratios by dividing both parts by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1 in this case.

Let's calculate the amounts:

- Zinc in X = \( \frac{6}{18} \times 40 = \frac{2}{3} \times 40 = \frac{80}{3} \) grams
- Copper in X = \( \frac{9}{18} \times 40 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) grams
- Zinc in Y = \( \frac{7}{18} \times 60 = \frac{70}{3} \) grams
- Copper in Y = \( \frac{11}{18} \times 60 = \frac{110}{3} \) grams

Total zinc in Z = \( \frac{80}{3} + \frac{70}{3} = \frac{150}{3} = 50 \) grams
Total copper in Z = 20 + \( \frac{110}{3} = \frac{130}{3} \) grams

Ratio of zinc to copper in Z = \( \frac{50}{\frac{130}{3}} = \frac{50 \times 3}{130} = \frac{150}{130} \)

This fraction simplifies to \( \frac{15}{13} \), which corresponds to 59:91 (since 15 is closest to 59 and 13 is closest to 91).

Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 59:91.

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? Answer Choices: (A) D/ (M-3)  (B) MD/3 (C) M/ (D-3)  (D) 3D/ (M2-3M)  (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: M men, gift worth Rs. D, 3 men drop out, additional contribution per person.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How much does each man originally contribute?
2. How much is the total original contribution?
3. How much is the gift after 3 men drop out?
4. How much additional contribution does each remaining man need to make?
5. How do we calculate the extra contribution per person?

Step 3: Analyze the relationships:
1. Each man contributes D/M initially.
2. Total original contribution = D * (M/1) = DM.
3. After 3 men drop out, there are M - 3 men left.
4. The new total contribution needed = D, since the gift price remains the same.
5. Additional contribution per person = (New total contribution) / (Number of remaining men) - Original contribution per person.

Step 4: Apply the calculations:
Additional contribution per person = D / (M - 3) - D/M
To simplify, multiply both terms by M(M - 3):
= MD / (M(M - 3)) - D(M - 3) / (M(M - 3))
= MD - D(M - 3) / M(M - 3)
= MD - DM + 3D / M(M - 3)
= 3D / M(M - 3)

So, the correct answer is (D) 3D / (M2 - 3M).

Therefore, the answer is (D).

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sam's hard drive, 250 files, infected, virus, worm, infected only by worm, both virus and worm, 50% not infected by virus, files NOT infected by worm.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation connects the number of files infected only by a worm to those infected by both virus and worm?2. What is the relationship between the number of files infected by both virus and worm, expressed as a factor?3. Who is the subject of the problem regarding the infection status of files?4. Where does the issue with the files take place?5. When is this problem set in terms of the infection status of the files?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of files not infected by a virus in order to find out the number not infected by a worm?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a cybersecurity scenario, the infection status of files was analyzed to understand the spread of malware. The first step in the investigation involved determining the relationship between different types of infections. When examining the data, it was found that the operation "union" connected the number of files infected solely by a worm (W) to those infected by both a virus (V) and a worm (W), denoted as V ∪ W. This union represents the total count of files affected by either a virus or a worm.To express the relationship as a factor, we can calculate the overlap, which is the intersection of the virus and worm infections (V ∩ W). If we let X be the total number of files under consideration, the factor representing the files infected by both can be calculated using the formula:Factor = (|V ∩ W|) / XThe subject of the problem revolves around the computer system, where files are stored and potentially vulnerable to infection. The issue with these files took place on a networked environment, where they could easily spread through shared resources.This problem is set at a specific point in time, when the IT team collected data on the infection status of the files to assess the extent of the threat. To find out the percentage of files not infected by a worm, it's crucial to know the proportion of files not infected by a virus (100% - (Percentage of V-infected files)). Since worms can infect files that were not already infected by a virus, knowing this percentage helps to deduce the remaining portion of files that would have remained unaffected by the worm if no virus had been present. This information is vital for prioritizing security measures and understanding the potential impact of the worm alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:large forest, 300 deer tagged in 2001, 500 deer caught in 2002, 20 tagged deer, percentage of tagged deer in 2002 sample, total deer population, no change in population.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the ratio of tagged deer to the total deer population in 2001?
2. How can we use the ratio from 2001 to find the total number of tagged deer in the forest in 2002?
3. What is the probability of catching a tagged deer in the 2002 sample if the ratio is representative?
4. How can we use the probability of catching a tagged deer in the sample to find the total number of tagged deer in the forest?
5. How can we use the number of tagged deer in the forest to find the total deer population?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, so the ratio of tagged deer to the total population is 300/total population.
2. Since the ratio is constant, if we have the number of tagged deer in the 2002 sample (20), we can set up an equation to find the total population: 20 = (300/total population) * 500.
3. The probability of catching a tagged deer in the sample is the number of tagged deer in the sample divided by the total number of deer caught in 2002, which is 20/500.
4. If this probability is representative, we can set up another equation: total tagged deer in the forest = probability of catching a tagged deer * total number of deer in the forest. Since the probability is the same as the ratio, we can write: total tagged deer = (300/total population) * total population.
5. Solving for the total population using the second equation will give us the answer.

Step 4: Solve for the total population:
20 = (300/total population) * 500
20 * total population = 300 * 500
total population = (300 * 500) / 20
total population = 15000 / 20
total population = 750

Since the total population cannot be a fraction, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7500.

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 60 (C) 28 (D) 26 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Mark, John, money, half, one-third, Rs.75.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What does Mark's statement imply about his current amount of money?2. How much money does Mark have if he receives half of John's money and ends up with Rs.75?3. What does John's statement imply about his current amount of money?4. How much money does John have if he receives one-third of Mark's money and ends up with Rs.75?5. Can we set up equations based on the information provided to find the amount of money John originally had?6. Which answer choice corresponds to the amount of money John had before the transactions?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
- From Mark's statement, we can infer that his current amount plus half of John's money equals Rs.75.
- Let's denote Mark's current amount as \( M \) and John's current amount as \( J \). Mark's statement can be written as: \( M + \frac{1}{2}J = 75 \)
- John's statement suggests that his current amount plus one-third of Mark's money equals Rs.75. So we have: \( J + \frac{1}{3}M = 75 \)

We now have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find \( J \).

Step 4: Solve the system of equations:
From the first equation, we can express \( M \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ M = 75 - \frac{1}{2}J \]

Substitute this expression for \( M \) into the second equation:
\[ J + \frac{1}{3}(75 - \frac{1}{2}J) = 75 \]
\[ J + 25 - \frac{1}{6}J = 75 \]
\[ \frac{5}{6}J = 75 - 25 \]
\[ \frac{5}{6}J = 50 \]
\[ J = \frac{50 \times 6}{5} \]
\[ J = 10 \times 6 \]
\[ J = 60 \]

So, John had Rs.60.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 60.

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: chocolate store, vanilla or cocoa flavors, 10% cocoa, 90% squashed, percentage of both vanilla and not squashed.
Step 2: Decompose the question into smaller parts:
1. Calculate the percentage of vanilla chocolates: Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa, and 10% are cocoa, the remaining 90% must be vanilla.
2. Determine the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed: We need to find the portion of vanilla chocolates that are not affected by the 90% squashing.
3. Calculate the intersection of vanilla and not squashed chocolates.
Step 3: Analyze the situation:
- 90% of chocolates are vanilla.
- 90% of the remaining chocolates (vanilla) are squashed, which means 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed.

To find the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed, we can multiply the percentage of vanilla chocolates by the percentage that are not squashed:

(90% vanilla) * (10% not squashed) = 9%

So, the percentage of the chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9%.

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2.

Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain.

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: man, spends, trousers, Rs 70 each, shirts, Rs 30 each, ratio, maximum number of trousers.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many trousers can the man buy with his total budget of Rs 810 at a price of Rs 70 each?2. How much money does the man have left after purchasing the maximum number of trousers?3. How many shirts can the man buy with the remaining money at a price of Rs 30 each?4. What is the ratio of the number of trousers to the number of shirts bought?5. Which answer choice corresponds to the maximum number of trousers the man can purchase?
Step 3: Analyze and solve:
- Calculate the maximum number of trousers: \[ \text{Number of Trousers} = \frac{\text{Total Budget}}{\text{Cost per Trouser}} = \frac{810}{70} \]
- Calculate the remaining money after buying the maximum number of trousers: \[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Total Budget} - (\text{Number of Trousers} \times \text{Cost per Trouser}) \]
- Calculate the number of shirts: \[ \text{Number of Shirts} = \frac{\text{Remaining Money}}{\text{Cost per Shirt}} = \frac{\text{Remaining Money}}{30} \]
- Calculate the ratio of trousers to shirts: \[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Number of Trousers}}{\text{Number of Shirts}} \]

Let's do the calculations:

- Number of Trousers: \( \frac{810}{70} = 11 \times 70 \div 70 = 11 \)
- Remaining Money: \( 810 - (11 \times 70) = 810 - 770 = 40 \)
- Number of Shirts: \( \frac{40}{30} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \) (since you can't buy a fraction of a shirt, we round down to 1)
- Ratio: \( \frac{11}{1} = 11 \)

So, the man can buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt, with the ratio being 11:1, which simplifies to 11 trousers.

The answer is (E) 11 Trousers.

How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: invoice for a motorboat, $20,000, terms 4/30, n/100, simple interest rate, highest affordable rate.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What does "4/30" mean in terms of payment terms?
2. What does "n/100" represent?
3. How does the discount work, and how does it relate to the simple interest calculation?
4. How can we find the highest simple interest rate that allows the merchant to afford the discount?
5. What formula do we use to calculate simple interest?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. "4/30" means the merchant has 4 days to pay the invoice without incurring any interest, and then an additional 30 days grace period before the full amount is due.
2. "n/100" likely refers to the annual interest rate, where "n" is the interest rate expressed as a decimal.
3. The merchant wants to take advantage of the discount by paying within the 4-day grace period. If they wait until the 30-day grace period, they'll have to pay the full amount plus interest, so the interest is the difference between the full amount and the discounted amount.
4. We need to find the highest simple interest rate that results in a total cost equal to the discounted price. The simple interest formula is: I = P * r * t, where I is interest, P is the principal (the original amount), r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.
5. Since the merchant has a 4-day grace period, we'll convert that to years (assuming 365 days in a year): t = 4 days / 365 days/year ≈ 0.0111 years.

Step 4: Calculate the highest interest rate:
The discounted amount is the original price minus the interest for the 4-day grace period. Let's denote the highest interest rate as r. The discounted amount (D) can be represented as:
D = $20,000 - (0.0111 * $20,000 * r)

The merchant can afford the discount if the total cost (including interest) is less than or equal to the discounted amount. So we set up the inequality:
$20,000 + (0.0111 * $20,000 * r) ≤ D

Since D = $20,000 - (0.0111 * $20,000 * r), we can substitute:
$20,000 + (0.0111 * $20,000 * r) ≤ $20,000 - (0.0111 * $20,000 * r)

Solving for r gives us the highest interest rate the merchant can afford.

Step 5: Solve for r:
$20,000 * (1 + 0.0111 * r) ≤ $20,000
0.0111 * r ≤ 0
r ≤ 0

This implies that the merchant can afford a simple interest rate of 0%, which is the highest possible rate that doesn't incur any interest charges.

However, since none of the answer choices is 0%, the correct answer must be "None of these" (option E).

Therefore, the answer is E.

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: total income, $9000, median income, $3000, number of members.
Step 2: Understand the concept of median income: The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in ascending order. If there's an even number of members, the median is the average of the two middle incomes.
Step 3: Analyze the situation: Since the median income is $3000, this means that half of the family members earn less than $3000 and half earn more than or equal to $3000. The total income is $9000, which is the sum of all individual incomes.
Step 4: Consider the possibilities: If there were only one member, the total income would be the median income. But since the total is $9000, there must be more members. Let's try to find the number of members that could result in a median of $3000 when combined with another member earning $3000.
Step 5: Calculate: If we have two members with incomes of $3000 each, the total would be $6000. To reach $9000, we need two more members with higher incomes. If we add another member earning $3000, the total becomes $9000, and the median remains $3000. If we add a fourth member earning $3000, the total is still $9000, but now the median would be the average of $3000 and $3000, which is also $3000.
Step 6: Conclusion: With four members, two earning $3000 and two earning more than $3000, the median income would be $3000. Therefore, there are 4 members in the family.

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Boomtown, population increase, 10% per year, two years, double the population, last year's population increase.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we set up an equation to represent the population growth over two years?
2. What does it mean for the population to be "exactly double" after two years?
3. If the population doubles after two years, what is the multiplier for each year?
4. How can we find the percent population increase for the last year if we know the overall increase for two years?
5. Which answer choice best represents the approximate percent increase for the last year?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. We can represent the population after two years as \( P_{t+2} = P_t \times (1 + 10\%)^2 \).
2. Since the population doubles, we have \( P_{t+2} = 2 \times P_t \).
3. Solving for the multiplier for each year, we get \( (1 + 10\%)^2 = 1.2^2 = 1.44 \). This means the population increases by 44% each year.
4. To find the last year's population increase, we need to find the difference between the 44% increase for two years and the total 100% increase over two years (since it doubles). That is \( 44\% - (100\% - 44\%) = 44\% - 56\% = -12\% \).
5. However, since we cannot have a negative population increase, the actual last year's increase must be the absolute value of this, which is 12%.

The closest answer choice to 12% is (B) 40%. While 40% is not exactly 12%, it is closer than the other choices and represents a significant increase that is still less than the full doubling.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the average of the highest and lowest scores in the problem?2. What is the formula to calculate the average of the entire class, given the sum and the number of students?3. Who are the two scores being excluded when calculating the average for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?4. In what context does the problem occur - a single exam or multiple exams?5. When does the exclusion of the highest and lowest scores take place - before or after determining the overall class average?6. Why is it necessary to exclude the highest and lowest scores when finding the new average?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the problem at hand, the process of finding the average involves several steps. To determine the average of the highest and lowest scores, one would typically use the arithmetic mean operation. This method requires adding the two scores together and then dividing by the count of scores, which is 2 in this case.To calculate the overall class average, given the sum of all scores (let's denote it as S) and the number of students (N), the formula is:Average_class = S / NWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores from the class average, we are looking at a different scenario. Let's assume the sum of scores excluding the top and bottom scores is denoted as S' and there are (N-2) students left. The new average, known as the median average, can be calculated using the following formula:New_average = S' / (N - 2)This exclusion occurs in the context of multiple exams or assignments, where outliers like exceptional performances or extreme difficulties might skew the overall grade distribution. By removing these scores, the new average provides a more representative measure of the typical performance for the majority of students.The exclusion of the highest and lowest scores takes place after determining the initial overall class average, but before computing the median average. The rationale behind this exclusion is to mitigate the influence of any extreme values that might not accurately reflect the typical student performance. This ensures a more balanced and fair assessment of the students' abilities.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: exam, candidate, secured marks, maximum mark, M, converted into 800 marks, secured 420 marks.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the original marks and the converted marks?2. How can we express the candidate's original score as a percentage of the maximum mark M?3. What is the formula to convert the original maximum mark M into a new scale where the candidate scored 420 marks out of 800?4. How can we find the value of M using the given information?
Step 3: Analyze these new questions:

1. The relationship between the original marks and the converted marks is that the candidate's score remains the same while the scale changes. The candidate secured 504 marks out of M in the original scale and 420 marks out of 800 in the converted scale.

2. To express the original score as a percentage of M, we can use the formula: (Original Score / Maximum Mark) * 100%.

3. To convert the maximum mark M into the new scale, we can set up the following equation: (504 / M) * M = (420 / 800) * 800. This equation allows us to solve for M.

4. Solving for M using the equation derived from step 3 will give us the value of the original maximum mark.

Let's solve for M:

(504 / M) * M = (420 / 800) * 800
504 = (420 * 800) / M
504M = 420 * 800
M = (420 * 800) / 504

Now, let's calculate the value of M:

M = (420 * 800) / 504
M = 336000 / 504
M = 666.666... (approximately)

However, since the answer choices are integers, we need to round the value of M to the nearest integer. The closest integer to 666.666... is 667, which is not among the given choices. There seems to be a mistake in the answer choices, as the correct value of M should be approximately 667.

If we look at the answer choices, none of them match our calculated value of approximately 667. Therefore, there might be an error in the question or the answer choices provided. Without a correct choice, we cannot provide a definitive answer.

Given the options, the best answer would be E) 960, which is the only choice that is significantly higher than the expected value of M. However, this is not a correct solution based on the information provided in the question. The correct answer should be approximately 667, but it is not listed among the choices.

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number? Answer Choices: (A) 22.5 (B) 84 (C) 21 (D) 24 (E) 25
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: a number, 30 subtracted, reduced to one-third, 50% of that number.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 
1. What is the original number if 30 is subtracted from it and it becomes one-third of the original number?
2. How do we find the original number using the given information?
3. Once we have the original number, how do we calculate 50% of that number?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. We can set up an equation to represent this situation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Original Number} = \text{Original Number} - 30 \)
2. Solving for the original number, we have: \( \text{Original Number} = \frac{30}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} \)
3. Calculate the original number and then find 50% of that number: \( \text{50% of Original Number} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Original Number} \)

Let's solve for the original number:

\[ \text{Original Number} = \frac{30}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{30}{\frac{2}{3}} = 30 \times \frac{3}{2} = 45 \]

Now, we'll find 50% of the original number:

\[ \text{50% of Original Number} = \frac{1}{2} \times 45 = 22.5 \]

So, the value of 50% of that number is 22.5.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 22.5.

Question:Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
 Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jerry, 1-year bond, $5,000, annual interest rate, 12%, compounded every six months, interest accrued, maturity..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation is used to calculate compound interest for this bond?2. What is the formula for compound interest when the interest is compounded semi-annually?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest payment schedule for this bond?4. In what context does the interest accrual occur (e.g., bank, investment firm)?5. When does the interest start accruing, and when does it stop during the 1-year period?6. How much interest would be earned on a $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate if compounded every six months?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To calculate the compound interest for the given bond, we need to utilize the appropriate formula. Compound interest is a powerful concept that allows interest to accumulate not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest over time. For a bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, the formula to calculate compound interest when interest is compounded semi-annually (twice a year) is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Here, A stands for the future value of the bond, P is the principal amount ($5,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.12 or 12%), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual compounding), and t is the time in years (1).Let's plug in the values:A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)A = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2Now, we perform the calculation:A ≈ 5000(1.06)^2A ≈ 5000 * 1.1236A ≈ $5,618So, the interest earned on the $5,000 bond after one year with semi-annual compounding at a 12% annual rate would be approximately $618.The responsibility for determining the interest payment schedule typically lies with the issuer of the bond, which could be a financial institution or an investment firm. The interest accrues continuously throughout the year, and for a 1-year period, it starts accruing from the day the bond is purchased and stops accruing just before the maturity date or the next coupon payment, whichever comes first. In this case, since we are calculating the total interest for the entire year, we assume it accrues until the end of the 1-year period.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Question:A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A bag, candy bars, 11 candy bars, three 50 cents each, four $1 each, four $2 each..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What are the different types of candy bars in the bag?2. How much: How much does each type of candy bar cost?3. Which: Which operation should be performed to find the total cost of the three 50-cent candy bars?4. How much: How much does the combination of four $1 candy bars cost?5. Which: Which operation should be used to find the total cost of the four $2 candy bars?6. How much: What is the total cost of all 11 candy bars combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a bag of assorted candy bars, there are various types to choose from. The first type is a 50-cent candy bar, which comes in three different flavors. To find the total cost of these three candy bars, you would perform a simple multiplication, as each costs 50 cents and there are three of them. That calculation would be:3 (candy bars) * $0.50 (cost per bar) = $1.50Moving on to another type, there are four $1 candy bars, each equally priced. The total cost for these can be calculated by multiplying the price per bar by the quantity:4 ($1 candy bars) * $1.00 (cost per bar) = $4.00Lastly, there are four $2 candy bars. To determine the total cost of these, we again multiply the price per bar by the number:4 ($2 candy bars) * $2.00 (cost per bar) = $8.00Now, to find the combined total cost of all 11 candy bars, we simply add the totals from the three groups together:$1.50 (50-cent bars) + $4.00 (1 dollar bars) + $8.00 (2 dollar bars) = $13.50So, the total cost of all 11 candy bars combined is $13.50.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:money pouch, Rs. 700, 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, one rupee coins.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of coin denominations are present in the money pouch?2. How much: How many of each coin denomination (25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee) does the pouch contain if the total amount is Rs. 700?3. How: Can you express the total value in rupees using the given coin values? 4. Who: If the owner wants to divide the coins equally, who would receive them?5. Where: In what context or situation does this problem arise, like a bank, a store, or personal finances?6. Why: Why is it important to know the exact distribution of coins, considering they all have different values?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a money pouch, the owner holds a mix of coin denominations to facilitate transactions. The pouch contains three types of coins: 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee. To determine the exact count for each, let's denote the number of 25 paise coins as x, 50 paise coins as y, and one rupee coins as z. Given that the total amount is Rs. 700, we can write the following equation based on their respective values:25p * x + 50p * y + 100p * z = 700Since 1 rupee is equivalent to 100 paise, we can simplify the equation to:25x + 50y + z = 7000 paiseTo find the distribution, we need to find integer solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy this equation. Let's assume that x is a multiple of 25 (as it represents the number of 25 paise coins), and since the total is divisible by 100, y should also be a multiple of 50 to ensure the divisibility by 1000.After trying out possible combinations, we find that one solution could be:x = 20 (25 paise coins)y = 12 (50 paise coins)z = 10 (one rupee coins)This adds up to 20 * 25 paise + 12 * 50 paise + 10 * 100 paise = 500 paise + 600 paise + 1000 paise = 2100 paise, which is close but not exactly 7000 paise. However, there might be a mistake in our assumption or an additional constraint. Upon re-evaluation, we realize that to reach exactly 7000 paise, we can adjust the counts slightly:x = 24 (25 paise coins)y = 10 (50 paise coins)z = 16 (one rupee coins)Now, the total value equals 24 * 25 + 10 * 50 + 16 * 100 = 600 + 500 + 1600 = 7000 paise.If the owner divides the coins equally among four people, each person would receive a share of:x/4, y/4, and z/4 coins, respectively.This scenario arises in personal finances, possibly when dividing tips or organizing a collection. Knowing the exact distribution of coins with different values is crucial because it ensures fairness and prevents any confusion or disputes over the division of wealth. Additionally, having a clear breakdown helps keep track of financial transactions and can be helpful for tax purposes or record-keeping.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.
The question provides two scenarios:
1. One soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents.
2. Two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents.

Step 2: Determine what we want to find.
We want to find the cost of one soda, the cost of one energy bar, or potentially the cost ratio between the two items.

Step 3: Set up equations based on the given information.
Let's denote the cost of one soda as S and the cost of one energy bar as B.

From Scenario 1:
S (soda) + 2B (energy bars) = 150 cents

From Scenario 2:
2S (two sodas) + 3B (three energy bars) = 300 cents

Step 4: Simplify the equations.
From Scenario 1:
S + 2B = 150

From Scenario 2:
2S + 3B = 300

Step 5: Solve for one variable in terms of the other.
Let's solve for S in terms of B from the first equation:
S = 150 - 2B

Now substitute this expression for S into the second equation:
2(150 - 2B) + 3B = 300

Step 6: Solve for B.
Expanding the equation:
300 - 4B + 3B = 300
-B = 0
B = 0 cents

However, this result doesn't make sense because energy bars cannot be free. There must be a mistake in the given information or the way it's interpreted. Let's double-check the information.

Upon re-examining the question, it seems there might be a typo or error, as the cost of two energy bars cannot be zero. Assuming the correct information is that one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents, and two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents, but the energy bars are not free, we need to adjust our approach.

Let's try to find the cost ratio between a soda and an energy bar instead. We can use the first scenario to express the cost of one energy bar in terms of a soda:

2B = 150 - S
B = (150 - S)/2

Now, we can substitute this expression for B into the second scenario to find the relationship between soda and energy bars:
2S + 3((150 - S)/2) = 300

Step 7: Solve for the ratio.
Expanding the equation:
2S + (3 * 150 - 3S)/2 = 300
4S + 450 - 3S = 600
S = 150 cents

Now that we have the cost of one soda, we can find the cost of one energy bar using the expression we derived earlier:
B = (150 - 150)/2
B = 0 cents (still doesn't make sense)

Given the inconsistency in the information, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer without more clarity. However, if we assume that the energy bars have a non-zero cost, the best we can do is express the relationship between the soda and energy bar costs based on the given data, which is that one soda costs 150 cents and one energy bar costs half the remaining cost after purchasing a soda (since two energy bars cost 150 cents).

Therefore, without a clear fix for the error, the answer is inconclusive, but we can say that the cost ratio between a soda and an energy bar is 1:0.5 (or 2:1).

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum? Answer Choices: (A) 2% (B) 8% (C) 5% (D) 10% (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Professors borrowed, Rs. 5000, simple interest, after 3 years, interest received by university, Rs. 300, rate of interest per annum.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How is the interest calculated in this situation? 2. What formula can be used to find the rate of interest when given the principal, time, and interest? 3. How do we calculate the interest for the professors if the university received Rs. 300 in interest after 3 years? 4. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the calculated interest rate?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- Simple interest is mentioned, so we don't need to consider compound interest.
- The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time / 100
- We need to find the rate, so we rearrange the formula to solve for Rate: Rate = (Interest * 100) / (Principal * Time)

Given:
- Principal = Rs. 5000
- Interest = Rs. 300
- Time = 3 years

Now, let's calculate the rate:
Rate = (300 * 100) / (5000 * 3)
Rate = (30000) / (15000)
Rate = 2%

So, the rate of interest per annum is 2%.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2%.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.
 Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, eat, fruit (breakfast), vegetable (dinner), 6 different types of fruit, 8 different types of vegetables, eat one type at a time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of combinations when selecting one type of fruit for breakfast?2. How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question
- Health food
- Vitamin E: 9% of daily requirement per gram
- Vitamin A: 8% of daily requirement per gram
- Minimum daily requirement for both vitamins
- Calculate the grams needed to meet both requirements

Step 2: Formulate the problem
Let x be the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirements for both vitamins. We can set up two equations based on the given percentages:

For Vitamin E:
0.09x = Vitamin E daily requirement

For Vitamin A:
0.08x = Vitamin A daily requirement

Since we want to meet both requirements, we can write:
0.09x + 0.08x = Total daily requirement for both vitamins

Step 3: Combine the equations
0.17x = Vitamin E daily requirement + Vitamin A daily requirement

However, we don't have the actual daily requirements for either vitamin. We can assume that they are constants, and we can represent them as a single variable, say VR (for Vitamin Requirement). So:

0.17x = VR

Step 4: Solve for x
To find x, we divide both sides by 0.17:
x = VR / 0.17

Since we need at least the minimum daily requirement, x should be greater than or equal to the combined minimum daily requirement for both vitamins. However, without the actual values for the daily requirements, we can't find an exact value for x. We can look at the answer choices to see which one provides enough of the health food to meet the combined minimum daily requirements.

Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices
We know that the question asks for the minimum amount of food needed, so we should choose the smallest number that is greater than or equal to the combined minimum daily requirements. The answer choices are integers, so we can check which one is closest to the actual value when rounded up to the nearest whole number. 

If VR is close to the lower end of the possible range, then we might need less than 10 grams (since 0.17 * 10 = 1.7, which is closest to the next integer, 2). If VR is higher, we could need more than 10 grams.

Looking at the answer choices, none of them are exactly divisible by 0.17, but the closest one is C) 12.5, which is 0.17 * 75. This suggests that 12.5 grams might be sufficient to meet the combined minimum daily requirements, assuming VR is not too high.

Therefore, the answer is likely C) 12.5 grams.

Note: Without the actual daily requirements for vitamins E and A, we can't definitively choose C as the answer. However, based on the information provided, it seems like the most reasonable choice given the context.

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Father, two sons (Mohan and Sohan), Rs. 5100, compound interest, 4% p.a., equal amount at 26 years.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How does the father distribute the money initially?
2. What is the relationship between the sons' shares such that they receive equal amounts at 26 years?
3. How does compound interest affect the growth of the sons' investments?
4. How can we calculate the present value of the future equal amount each son will receive at 26 years?
5. How can we find Mohan's share knowing the total amount and the shared future value?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- The father divides the money in a way that the future value of their investments at 26 years will be equal despite different initial amounts.
- Compound interest grows the initial investment at a rate of 4% annually.
- We need to find the present value of the equal amount each son will receive at 26 years, considering both their initial shares and the compound interest.

Let's denote Mohan's share as \( M \) and Sohan's share as \( S \). Since the future value is equal, we can write:

\[ M \times (1 + r)^{t} = S \times (1 + r)^{t} \]

where \( r \) is the annual interest rate (4% or 0.04) and \( t \) is the time difference between now and 26 years (2 years).

Given that \( M + S = 5100 \), we can express \( S \) in terms of \( M \):

\[ S = 5100 - M \]

Now, substitute \( S \) in the future value equation:

\[ M \times (1 + 0.04)^{2} = (5100 - M) \times (1 + 0.04)^{2} \]

Solving for \( M \):

\[ M = \frac{5100 \times (1 + 0.04)^{2}}{2} \]

Let's calculate the value of \( M \):

\[ M = \frac{5100 \times (1.04)^{2}}{2} \]
\[ M = \frac{5100 \times 1.0816}{2} \]
\[ M = \frac{5499.36}{2} \]
\[ M = 2749.68 \]

However, the options provided do not include 2749.68, so there seems to be an error in the calculations or the answer choices given. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 2749.68, which is not listed in the options.

Therefore, the answer is E) None of these. There might be an error in the provided answer choices or the question itself.

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Simple interest (SI), Compound interest (CI), Rs.5000, 2 years, difference of Rs.72, rate of interest.

Step 2: Identify the relationship between the variables:
- We need to find the rate of interest.
- The difference between CI and SI for the same principal, time, and difference in amount is given.

Step 3: Formulate the equations for SI and CI:
- SI = P * R * T / 100 (where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time)
- CI = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P (where CI is calculated as the difference between the final amount and the principal)

Step 4: Given values:
- P = Rs.5000
- T = 2 years
- Difference between CI and SI = Rs.72

Step 5: Express the difference in terms of the rate (R):
- CI - SI = 72
- P * ((1 + R/100)^T - 1) - P * R * T / 100 = 72

Step 6: Simplify the equation:
- 5000 * ((1 + R/100)^2 - 1) - 5000 * R * 2 / 100 = 72
- 5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 - 5000 * R / 50 = 72
- 5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 - 100R = 72

Step 7: Solve for R:
- Let's isolate R:
- 5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 = 72 + 100R
- 5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 - 100R = 72
- 5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 = 100R + 72
- 5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 - 100R - 72 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in R. However, since we are looking for a small percentage (the interest rate), we can try plugging in the answer choices and see which one fits the equation.

Step 8: Check the answer choices:
- For each choice, substitute R and check if the equation holds true.
- Let's start with (A) 10% (R = 10):
- 5000 * (1 + 10/100)^2 - 100 * 10 = 72
- 5000 * (1.1)^2 - 1000 = 72
- 5000 * 1.21 - 1000 = 72
- 6050 - 1000 = 72 (False)

Continue checking the other choices until you find the correct one.

After checking all the choices, we find that (B) 12% (R = 12) satisfies the equation:
- 5000 * (1 + 12/100)^2 - 100 * 12 = 72
- 5000 * (1.12)^2 - 1200 = 72
- 5000 * 1.2544 - 1200 = 72
- 6272 - 1200 = 72 (True)

Therefore, the rate of interest is 12%.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:electric pole, height (14 metres), shadow (10 metres), height of a tree, shadow (15 metres).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the tree based on the relationship between the pole's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the pole and its shadow compared to the height of the tree and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the tree's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the tree with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a tree based on the pole's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle.The entities in this situation are the pole and the tree, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the pole (H_pole) and its corresponding shadow (S_pole), as well as the height of the tree's shadow (S_tree), you can use the following formula to calculate the tree's height (H_tree):H_tree = H_pole * (S_tree / S_pole)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the tree's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_tree_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (pole shadow to tree shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_pole / S_treeThen, apply this ratio to the new tree shadow length:H_tree_prime = H_pole * (S_tree_prime / S_pole)By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the tree's height accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cost, gardening, 1-metre broad boundary, rectangular plot, perimeter, 340 metres, rate, 10 per square metre.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total area to be gardened?2. What mathematical procedure should be followed to calculate the length and width of the rectangular plot?3. Who is responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate?4. In what type of setting does this cost calculation take place (e.g., residential, commercial)?5. Assuming no change in rates, when would the cost calculation be applicable (i.e., immediate or during a specific period)?6. How much would the cost be if the cost per square meter remained constant at 10?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total area to be gardened, you would perform an addition operation, as the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The mathematical procedure for determining the dimensions of the rectangular plot involves rearranging the formula for area: if the total area (A) is given, you can use A = length × width to find the length when the width is known, or vice versa, by dividing the area by the other dimension.Once the dimensions are calculated, the person responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate is typically the homeowner or the contractor, depending on the context. In a residential setting, this cost calculation takes place when planning a landscaping project or deciding on a gardening budget.Assuming no changes in rates, this cost calculation would be applicable immediately after obtaining the area and the rate per square meter. For instance, if the rate remains constant at 10 dollars per square meter, the cost (C) can be calculated using the formula C = area × rate. If the total area to be gardened is 100 square meters, the cost would be:C = 100 square meters × $10/square meter = $1000.So, the passage detailing the process is as follows:To find the total area to be gardened, simply add the length and width of the plot. To determine the dimensions, knowing the area (A), use the formula A = length × width. The homeowner or contractor would then calculate the cost based on this area and the rate, say $10 per square meter. In a residential setting, this calculation is immediate. For a total area of 100 square meters with a constant rate of $10/square meter, the cost would be $1000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question - quadratic equation, roots, one root given as 1.5, m (coefficient of x^2).
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
- What is the relationship between the coefficients of a quadratic equation and its roots?
- Given that one root of the equation is 1.5, how can we find the value of m using Vieta's formulas?
- Are there any restrictions on the values of m that would allow for a real root of 1.5?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- In a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is equal to -b/a and the product of the roots is equal to c/a. These are known as Vieta's formulas.
- Since one root is given as 1.5, let's call the other root r. According to Vieta's formulas, 1.5 + r = -m and 1.5r = 22 (since the product of the roots is 22).
- We need to find m, so we need to solve for m in terms of r using the second equation.

Step 4: Solve for m:
From the second equation, we have r = 22/1.5. Now substitute this into the first equation:
1.5 + r = -m
1.5 + (22/1.5) = -m

Step 5: Calculate the value of m:
1.5 + (22/1.5) = -m
1.5 + 14.67 = -m (since 22/1.5 = 14.67)
16.17 = -m

Step 6: Determine the answer choice:
To find the value of m, we multiply both sides by -1:
m = -16.17

The correct answer choice is (D) -16.2, which is the rounded version of -16.17. Note that the given options might not include a decimal, but since the question allows for exact answers, the correct answer is D. If the options only had integer choices, then E would be the correct answer because the exact value of m cannot be determined from the given information without more precision.

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet? Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D)  (13x+1) /24 (E)  (13x-12) /24
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Pickets: x
- Width per picket: 1/2 inch
- Space between pickets: 6 inches
- Goal: Length of fence in feet

Step 2: Decompose the question into smaller parts:
- Calculate the total width contributed by x pickets (including the gaps)
- Convert the total width from inches to feet (since the answer choices are in feet)
- Identify the correct expression representing the length of the fence

Step 3: Calculate the total width:
Each picket contributes 1/2 inch, so x pickets contribute \( x \times \frac{1}{2} \) inches. There are 6 inches of space between each pair, so for x pickets, there will be \( (x - 1) \) gaps. The total width including gaps is:
\[ x \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ inches/picket} + (x - 1) \times 6 \text{ inches/gap} \]

Step 4: Simplify the expression for the total width:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1) \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 \]

Step 5: Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 6x = \frac{x + 12x}{2} = \frac{13x}{2} \]

Step 6: Convert inches to feet (1 foot = 12 inches):
\[ \frac{13x}{2} \text{ inches} = \frac{13x}{2} \times \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}} \]
\[ \frac{13x}{24} \text{ feet} \]

Step 7: Compare this result with the answer choices:
The correct expression representing the length of the fence in feet is \( \frac{13x}{24} \).

Answer: C) \( \frac{13x}{24} \)

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
 Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:$8.50, cab fare, $3.50, first quarter-mile, 10 cents, additional quarter mile, maximum distance..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile?2. How much does the cab charge per additional quarter-mile?3. How many quarter-miles can be traveled with the initial $3.50?4. What is the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile?5. How many times will the additional charge of 10 cents be applied to reach the limit of $8.50?6. What is the maximum distance that can be reached by adding the cost of the first quarter-mile and the additional quarter-mile charges?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile, you would use the initial fare, which is $3.50. This covers the first part of the trip. The cab charges an additional 10 cents per quarter-mile after the first one. To find out how many quarter-miles the initial $3.50 covers, you divide the initial fare by the charge per quarter-mile:\( \frac{\$3.50}{\$0.10/quarter-mile} = 35 quarter-miles \)For the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile, you add the initial charge to the sum of charges for each subsequent quarter-mile up to the point where the fare exceeds the limit of $8.50. Since the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, we need to find out how many times this charge can be applied before reaching $8.50:Let x be the number of additional quarter-miles. The equation will be:\( \$3.50 + (x * \$0.10) = \$8.50 \)Solving for x:\( x = \frac{\$8.50 - \$3.50}{\$0.10} \)\( x = \frac{\$5.00}{\$0.10} \)\( x = 50 quarter-miles \)The additional charge will be applied 50 times to reach the limit.Now, to find the maximum distance that can be reached, we add the first quarter-mile to the total number of additional quarter-miles:\( 1 quarter-mile + 50 quarter-miles = 51 quarter-miles \)So, the total distance is 51 quarter-miles converted to miles, knowing that 1 mile equals 4 quarter-miles:\( 51 \frac{quarter-miles}{4} = 12.75 miles \)In summary, the cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50, the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, the initial $3.50 covers 35 quarter-miles, the formula for total fare beyond the first mile is the initial fare plus 10 cents per quarter-mile up to 50 quarters, resulting in a total fare of $8.50, and the maximum distance is 12.75 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches. On this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road? Answer Choices: (A) 800 (B) 720 (C) 960 (D) 1140 (E) 1160
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: map, road, Town F to Town G, length on map, scale, actual distance, conversion factor.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the map scale and the actual distance represented by 1/4 inch?
2. How can we use this relationship to find the actual distance for the 20 inches on the map?
3. Given that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, how do we calculate the actual distance for 20 inches?
4. Which mathematical operation should be applied to convert the map measurement into actual miles?
5. What is the actual distance, in miles, that corresponds to 20 inches on the map?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. The scale tells us that 1/4 inch on the map represents 10 miles in reality.
2. We can find the actual distance by multiplying the map measurement by the conversion factor (the ratio of actual miles to map inches).
3. To find the actual distance for 20 inches, we multiply 20 by the conversion factor, which is 10 miles per 1/4 inch.
4. We need to multiply by the conversion factor (4 times, since there are 4 1/4-inch segments in 20 inches).
5. Calculate the actual distance: \( 20 \text{ inches} \times (4 \times \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{1/4 \text{ inch}}) \).

Step 4: Perform the calculation:
\( 20 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \times 10 = 800 \text{ miles} \)

The actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 800 miles.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 800.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: original length, ratio, reduction.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What does it mean by "reduced in the ratio 5:3"? 
2. How do we calculate the new length based on the original length and the given ratio?
3. Given the original length is 30 cm, how do we apply the ratio to find the new length?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. A ratio of 5:3 means that for every 5 parts of the original length, there are 3 parts that are reduced. This implies that the total parts after reduction are 5+3=8 parts.
2. To find the new length, we need to divide the original length by the total parts (8) and then multiply by the part representing the reduced length (which is 5 parts out of 8).
3. We can express the new length as follows: New Length = (Original Length / Total Parts) * Reduced Part Ratio.

Now, let's apply these steps to the problem:

New Length = (30 cm / 8) * 5
New Length = 3.75 cm * 5
New Length = 18.75 cm

However, the answer choices are given in whole numbers, so we round to the nearest whole number, which is 18 cm.

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Question:A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: rope, 20 meters long, cut into two pieces, length difference, longer piece, find length.
Step 2: Identify the relationships: We know the total length of the rope and that the difference in length between the two pieces is 3 meters. Let's denote the length of the longer piece as \( L \) and the length of the shorter piece as \( L - 3 \).
Step 3: Set up an equation: Since the total length of the rope is 20 meters, we can write the equation: \( L + (L - 3) = 20 \).
Step 4: Solve the equation: Combine like terms to get \( 2L - 3 = 20 \). Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with \( L \): \( 2L = 23 \). Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \): \( L = \frac{23}{2} \).
Step 5: Simplify the fraction: \( L = 11.5 \) meters.
Step 6: Match the answer with the choices: The length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters, which corresponds to choice (D).

 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: trapezium-shaped canal, top width (10 m), bottom width (6 m), area of cross-section (640 square meters), depth of the canal.
Step 2: Identify the relevant formulas: 
- The area A of a trapezoid is given by the formula: A = (1/2) * (b1 + b2) * h, where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides (top and bottom widths), and h is the height (or depth) of the trapezoid.
Step 3: Apply the formula to the problem:
- Given: b1 = 10 m, b2 = 6 m, A = 640 square meters.
- We need to find h, so substitute the values into the formula: 640 = (1/2) * (10 + 6) * h.
Step 4: Solve for h:
- Simplify the equation: 640 = (1/2) * 16 * h.
- Multiply: 640 = 8h.
- Divide both sides by 8 to isolate h: h = 640 / 8.
- Calculate the depth: h = 80 meters.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3.

When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Question:A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
 Answer Choices: (A)  13.3542 (B)  15.8113 (C)  18.3451 (D)  19.5667 (E)  20.8888
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, sphere, diameter..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation connects the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter?2. What is the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid?3. Who or what determines the sphere's diameter based on the inscribed rectangular solid?4. In which geometric context does this problem take place - Euclidean space or a non-Euclidean surface?5. When inscribing a rectangular solid into a sphere, what property ensures that all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface?6. How can we calculate the sphere's diameter using the dimensions of the rectangular solid (3 x 4 x 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The problem revolves around the relationship between a rectangular solid and a sphere inscribed within it in Euclidean space. The mathematical operation connecting the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter is the concept of similarity. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the longest diagonal of the solid represents the diameter of the sphere. This relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the three dimensions of the rectangular solid, which states that the square of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two dimensions (l, w, and h): d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2.In this case, let's use the dimensions provided: l = 3 units, w = 4 units, and h = 15 units. Calculating the longest diagonal (d) gives us:d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225d^2 = 250Now, taking the square root of both sides to find the diameter:d = √250 ≈ 15.81 unitsThus, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.81 units, and it is determined by the inscribed rectangular solid's dimensions within a Euclidean context. The property that ensures all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface is known as the 'inscribed property,' which guarantees that the sphere's radius is half the length of the longest diagonal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Hollow cube with side length 5 cm and thickness 1 cm.
- Smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
- Painting the outer surface.
- Counting unpainted faces of the smaller cubes.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many layers of smaller cubes make up the hollow cube?
2. How many faces of a single smaller cube are exposed on the outer surface?
3. How many faces of the smaller cubes are covered by the inner cube?
4. How many faces of the smaller cubes are painted?
5. How many faces remain unpainted?

Step 3: Analyze and solve:

1. The hollow cube has a side length of 5 cm, so it consists of 5 layers of smaller cubes along each edge (since the thickness is 1 cm). There are 4 edges on a cube, so there are 5 * 4 = 20 layers of smaller cubes.

2. Each smaller cube has 6 faces. However, only the outermost face of each cube is exposed on the outer surface of the larger cube.

3. The inner cube, with a side length of 4 cm (5 - 1), has 4 layers of smaller cubes. These cubes cover the inner surfaces of the larger cube, so their faces are not exposed.

4. Since we are painting the outer surface, we paint the faces of the cubes in the outermost layer (20 layers * 6 faces per layer).

5. To find the unpainted faces, we subtract the painted faces from the total faces of the smaller cubes. Total faces = 20 layers * 6 faces per layer = 120 faces. Unpainted faces = Total faces - Painted faces = 120 - (20 layers * 6 faces) = 120 - 120 = 0.

However, the answer choices provided don't match the result. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices given, as the correct answer should be zero faces unpainted. If the question intended to ask about the number of faces that are not accessible for painting due to the hollow structure, then the answer would be the faces covered by the inner cube, which is 4 layers * 6 faces = 24 faces.

Since the options provided don't seem to reflect the correct answer, the most appropriate response would be to request clarification or indicate that the given choices are incorrect.

Question:An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:electric pole, height (14 metres), shadow (10 metres), height of a tree, shadow (15 metres).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the tree based on the relationship between the pole's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the pole and its shadow compared to the height of the tree and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the tree's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the tree with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a tree based on the pole's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle.The entities in this situation are the pole and the tree, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the pole (H_pole) and its corresponding shadow (S_pole), as well as the height of the tree's shadow (S_tree), you can use the following formula to calculate the tree's height (H_tree):H_tree = H_pole * (S_tree / S_pole)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the tree's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_tree_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (pole shadow to tree shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_pole / S_treeThen, apply this ratio to the new tree shadow length:H_tree_prime = H_pole * (S_tree_prime / S_pole)By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the tree's height accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
 Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:height of a room, semi-perimeter, ratio 2:5, cost, Rs.260, paper width, Rs.2 per meter, area for doors and windows, height of the room.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the semi-perimeter based on the given ratio of height to semi-perimeter?2. What calculation can be done to convert the paper width from centimeters to meters?3. How many meters of paper 50 cm wide are needed to cover the walls of the room, considering the cost of Rs.2 per meter?4. How many square meters of the room's walls need to be excluded for the area of doors and windows?5. Using the cost of Rs.260 and the cost per meter, how much does it cost to paper the walls without considering the exclusion of doors and windows?6. Given the total cost and the cost per meter, what is the total length of the walls that need to be papered, including the area for doors and windows?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the semi-perimeter of the room based on the given height-to-semi-perimeter ratio, you would first express the semi-perimeter (s) in terms of the height (h). Let's denote the ratio as r, so s = hr. If the ratio is provided, you can simply multiply the height by the ratio to find the semi-perimeter.To convert the paper width from centimeters to meters, you would divide the width in centimeters by 100, since there are 100 centimeters in a meter. So, if the paper is 50 cm wide, the width in meters would be 50 / 100 = 0.5 meters.To determine the amount of paper needed to cover the walls, you would multiply the total wall area by the paper's width. Assuming the room has four walls, each with the same height as the semi-perimeter (s), the total width for all walls is 4 * s. The cost calculation would be done by multiplying the total width in meters by the cost per meter, which is Rs.2. Let's assume the area of doors and windows is A square meters. To find out how many square meters need to be excluded, you would subtract A from the total wall area, which is 4 * sh.The cost to paper the walls without considering doors and windows can be found by multiplying the total width (4 * sh) in meters by the cost per meter (Rs.2). If the total cost is Rs.260, you can set up the equation: 4 * s * h * 2 = 260.Finally, to find the total length of the walls that need to be papered, including the area for doors and windows, you would add the area of the doors and windows (A) back to the total wall area after the exclusion. This can be expressed as 4 * s + A. Once you have the total length, you can find the cost by multiplying it by the cost per meter again.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A flagstaff 17.5 metre high casts a shadow of length 40.25 metre. The height of building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions will be : Answer Choices: (A) 12 metre (B) 12.5 metre (C) 13.5 metre (D) 14 metre (E) 15 metre
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: flagstaff height, shadow length, building height, similar conditions.
Step 2: Identify the relationship: We are looking for a proportional relationship between the height of the flagstaff and the shadow it casts, and then applying that same relationship to find the height of the building based on its shadow length.
Step 3: Set up a proportion: Let the height of the flagstaff be \( H_{flagstaff} \), the shadow length be \( S_{flagstaff} \), and the height of the building be \( H_{building} \) with its shadow length \( S_{building} \). Since the conditions are similar, the ratio of height to shadow length remains constant.

The proportion can be written as:
\[ \frac{H_{flagstaff}}{S_{flagstaff}} = \frac{H_{building}}{S_{building}} \]

Given:
\( H_{flagstaff} = 17.5 \) m,
\( S_{flagstaff} = 40.25 \) m,
\( S_{building} = 28.75 \) m.

We need to find \( H_{building} \).

Step 4: Solve for \( H_{building} \):
\[ H_{building} = \frac{H_{flagstaff} \times S_{building}}{S_{flagstaff}} \]
\[ H_{building} = \frac{17.5 \times 28.75}{40.25} \]

Now, calculate the value.
\[ H_{building} = \frac{496.875}{40.25} \]
\[ H_{building} \approx 12.33 \] meters

However, since the answer choices are not provided in decimal format, we need to round to the nearest whole number, which is 12.5 meters.

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: rectangular sheet, folded into two equal halves, perimeter, two different folding methods, area.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the perimeter of a rectangle and its dimensions when it's folded into two equal halves along one set of sides?
2. What is the relationship between the perimeter of a rectangle and its dimensions when it's folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides?
3. How can we use the given perimeters to find the dimensions of the original rectangle?
4. Once we have the dimensions, how do we calculate the area of the original rectangle?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
- When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 48 cm. This means that the total length plus twice the width of the rectangle is 48 cm.
- When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 66 cm. This means that the total width plus twice the length of the rectangle is 66 cm.

Let's denote the length as L and the width as W. We can write the equations based on the perimeters:
1. For folding along one set of sides: 2L + 2W = 48 (since there are two equal halves)
2. For folding along the other set of sides: 2W + 2L = 66

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously to find L and W.

Step 4: Solve the system of equations:
From the first equation, we can express W in terms of L:
W = (48 - 2L) / 2
W = 24 - L

Substitute W in the second equation:
2(24 - L) + 2L = 66
48 - 2L + 2L = 66
48 = 66

This is a contradiction, meaning our initial assumption about the perimeters was incorrect. The correct interpretation of the problem is that the perimeters are for the unfolded rectangle, not the folded halves. Therefore, we need to consider the unfolded rectangle's perimeter.

The total perimeter of the unfolded rectangle is the sum of the two given perimeters:
P_total = 48 cm + 66 cm = 114 cm

For a rectangle, the perimeter P is given by:
P = 2L + 2W

Since P_total = 114 cm, we can now solve for L and W:
114 = 2L + 2W
114 = 2(L + W)

Now, we can use the fact that the area A of a rectangle is given by:
A = L * W

Step 5: Solve for the area:
Given that L + W = 57 (from the perimeter equation), we can substitute W = 57 - L into the area formula:
A = L * (57 - L)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
A = 57L - L^2

We need to find the maximum area, which occurs at the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic equation. The vertex of a parabola y = ax^2 + bx + c is found at x = -b / 2a. In our case, a = -1 and b = 57.

x = -57 / (2 * -1) = 57 / 2 = 28.5

So, L = 28.5 cm, and W = 57 - 28.5 = 28.5 cm.

Step 6: Calculate the area:
A = L * W
A = 28.5 * 28.5
A = 792.225 square centimeters, approximately.

The closest answer choice to 792.225 is (C) 792.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: R, S, T, U, line segments, midpoint, lengths, RS=5, RT=17, ST=22, RU.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between U and ST, given that U is the midpoint?
2. How can we find the length of RU if we know the lengths of RS, RT, and ST?
3. How can we use the fact that U is the midpoint to relate the lengths of RT and RS to RU?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. Since U is the midpoint of ST, this means that the distance from U to either S or T is half the length of ST. So, RU = ST/2.
2. We need to find the length of RU, which is half of ST.
3. We can use the fact that the total length of RT (which includes RU and US) is equal to the sum of RS and RU because U is the common point between them. Therefore, RT = RS + RU.

Now, let's apply this knowledge to solve the problem:

RU = ST/2
RT = RS + RU
Given: RS = 5, RT = 17, ST = 22

Substitute the known values into the second equation:
17 = 5 + RU
Now, solve for RU:
RU = 17 - 5
RU = 12

However, this is not one of the answer choices. There seems to be an error in the calculations. Let's double-check our work:

RU = ST/2
RU = 22/2
RU = 11

The correct length of line segment RU is 11, which is not listed in the answer choices. It appears there might be an error in the question or answer choices provided. If the correct answer is indeed 11, it should be included in the options. If not, please confirm the answer choices and we'll proceed accordingly.

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: rectangular piece, area, length, breadth, 1m more than 4 times the breadth, perimeter.
Step 2: Formulate equations based on the given information:
- Let's denote the breadth as 'b' and the length as 'l'.
- We know that the area of the rectangle is 150 square meters, so we can write: l * b = 150.
- According to the problem, the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, so we can write: l = 4b + 1.

Step 3: Substitute the expression for 'l' from the second equation into the first equation to solve for 'b':
(4b + 1) * b = 150.

Step 4: Solve for 'b':
4b^2 + b = 150
4b^2 + b - 150 = 0

Now, factorize or use the quadratic formula to find 'b'. Factoring gives us:
(4b - 15)(b + 10) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions for 'b': b = 15/4 or b = -10. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we choose b = 15/4 meters.

Step 5: Now that we have the breadth, we can find the length using the second equation:
l = 4 * (15/4) + 1
l = 15 + 1
l = 16 meters.

Step 6: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth).
Perimeter = 2 * (16 + 15/4)
Perimeter = 2 * (64 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 79
Perimeter = 158 meters.

However, this answer choice is not listed among the given options. There seems to be an error in the answer choices provided. The correct perimeter should be 158 meters, which is not listed. If the answer choices were correct, the closest option would be (C) 62 m, but since that is not the correct answer, there may be an issue with the options provided.

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Rectangular parking space
- Three sides painted
- Unpainted side length: 9 feet
- Sum of painted side lengths: 37 feet
- Area of the parking space: Unknown

Step 2: Decompose the question into smaller parts:
1. Identify the dimensions: We know the length (unpainted side) and the sum of the two widths (painted sides).
2. Calculate the width: Since there are two painted sides, we can find the width by dividing the total length of the painted sides by 2.
3. Apply the area formula: Area of a rectangle = length x width. Use the length and width found in steps 1 and 2 to find the area.

Step 3: Solve for the width:
Width = Sum of painted side lengths / 2
Width = 37 feet / 2
Width = 18.5 feet

Step 4: Calculate the area:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 9 feet x 18.5 feet

Step 5: Perform the multiplication:
Area = 166.5 square feet

Step 6: Compare the calculated area to the answer choices:
None of the provided answer choices match the calculated area of 166.5 square feet.

Conclusion: The correct answer is E) None, as none of the given choices match the calculated area. There might be an error in the answer choices provided.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1000p (B) 1500p (C) 2000p (D) 2500p (E) 30000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:phone manufacturer, crates, pallets, each pallet, phones, 4 crates.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of phones per crate?2. How many phones does one pallet hold?3. What is the relationship between the number of pallets and the number of phones in a crate?4. How many phones are there in 4 crates if each crate has the same number of pallets?5. Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Step 1: Key elements of the question: Tank dimensions, capacity.
Step 2: New questions: 
1. How do we calculate the volume of the tank?
2. What unit should we convert the volume to match the answer choices?
3. Which answer choice gives the correct volume?

Step 3: Analyzing the question:
- The volume of a rectangular tank can be calculated using the formula: Volume = length × width × height.
- Given the dimensions in meters, we need to convert the volume to liters, as the answer choices are in liters.

Step 4: Calculating the volume:
Volume = 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m
Volume = 48 m³

Step 5: Converting cubic meters to liters:
1 m³ ≈ 1000 liters (since 1 liter ≈ 1 dm³ and 1 m³ = 1000 dm³)
So, 48 m³ ≈ 48 × 1000 liters = 48000 liters

Step 6: Comparing with the answer choices:
- The closest answer choice that matches the volume is 48000 liters, which is not listed directly.

However, since the options are provided in increments of 1000, we can look for the closest option that is less than 48000 liters. The largest choice that is less than 48000 is 42000 liters (which is 12000 liters * 3).

Therefore, the correct answer, considering the available options, is (B) 1200 liters, as it is the closest lower value to the calculated volume.

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
 Answer Choices: (A)  13.3542 (B)  15.8113 (C)  18.3451 (D)  19.5667 (E)  20.8888
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, sphere, diameter..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation connects the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter?2. What is the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid?3. Who or what determines the sphere's diameter based on the inscribed rectangular solid?4. In which geometric context does this problem take place - Euclidean space or a non-Euclidean surface?5. When inscribing a rectangular solid into a sphere, what property ensures that all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface?6. How can we calculate the sphere's diameter using the dimensions of the rectangular solid (3 x 4 x 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The problem revolves around the relationship between a rectangular solid and a sphere inscribed within it in Euclidean space. The mathematical operation connecting the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter is the concept of similarity. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the longest diagonal of the solid represents the diameter of the sphere. This relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the three dimensions of the rectangular solid, which states that the square of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two dimensions (l, w, and h): d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2.In this case, let's use the dimensions provided: l = 3 units, w = 4 units, and h = 15 units. Calculating the longest diagonal (d) gives us:d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225d^2 = 250Now, taking the square root of both sides to find the diameter:d = √250 ≈ 15.81 unitsThus, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.81 units, and it is determined by the inscribed rectangular solid's dimensions within a Euclidean context. The property that ensures all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface is known as the 'inscribed property,' which guarantees that the sphere's radius is half the length of the longest diagonal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question - volume ratio, cube, sphere.
Step 2: New questions - 
1. How do we calculate the volume of a cube?
2. How do we calculate the volume of a sphere?
3. What is the relationship between the side length of a cube and the diameter of the sphere that fits inside it?
4. How do we find the ratio of the volumes of a cube to a sphere inscribed within it?

Step 3: Answering the new questions:
1. The volume of a cube is given by V_cube = side_length^3.
2. The volume of a sphere is given by V_sphere = (4/3)π(radius)^3. Since the sphere fits inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the side length of the cube.
3. The radius of the sphere is side_length / 2, so its volume can be written as V_sphere = (4/3)π(side_length/2)^3.

Step 4: Connecting the ratios:
- The volume of the cube is V_cube = side_length^3.
- The volume of the sphere is V_sphere = (4/3)π(side_length/2)^3 = (4/3)π(side_length^3) / 8.

The ratio of the volumes is thus V_cube / V_sphere = (side_length^3) / ((4/3)π(side_length^3) / 8).

Step 5: Simplify the ratio:
V_cube / V_sphere = (8 / (4/3)) = (8 * 3 / 4) = 6 / 1 = 6.

Since the question asks for the ratio without the π term, we can express it as 6:π.
