Question: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer: Relative Speed: 55-52=3 mph
Distance:15 miles
Time: distance/speed=15/3= 5 hours
Correct answer is B The answer is B.

Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the 3-digit number as \( N = ABC \), where \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively.

When 2272 is divided by \( N \), we can write it as:
\[ 2272 = N \cdot Q_1 + R_1 \]
where \( Q_1 \) is the quotient and \( R_1 \) is the remainder.

Similarly, when 875 is divided by \( N \), we have:
\[ 875 = N \cdot Q_2 + R_2 \]

Since both divisions yield the same remainder, we can write:
\[ R_1 = R_2 \]

From the given numbers, we know that \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are between 0 and \( N - 1 \). Since 2272 is greater than 875, \( R_1 \) must be less than \( R_2 \), but since they're equal, \( R_1 = R_2 = 0 \) (because 0 is the smallest possible remainder).

Now, let's express 2272 and 875 as multiples of \( N \):
\[ 2272 = 1000N + A \cdot 100 + B \cdot 10 + C \]
\[ 875 = 1000N + A \cdot 100 + B \cdot 10 + C \]

Subtracting these equations gives us:
\[ 2272 - 875 = (1000N + A \cdot 100 + B \cdot 10 + C) - (1000N + A \cdot 100 + B \cdot 10 + C) \]
\[ 1397 = 0 \]

This implies that \( 1397 \) is divisible by \( N \). Since \( N \) is a 3-digit number, the only factor of 1397 that is a 3-digit number is 11 (as 1397 = 11 * 127, and 127 is prime). Therefore, \( N = 11 \).

The sum of the digits of \( N \) is \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is not among the given choices. There seems to be an error in the provided answer choices. However, based on the logic, the correct answer should be \( N = 11 \) with a sum of digits of 2.

If the answer choices were correct, the closest option would be (A) 10, which is incorrect due to the actual sum being 2. Without a correct choice, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer. Please double-check the question or the answer choices.

Answer:
Output:
Answer: For a number to have exactly 5 factors, it must be of the form p^4 or p^2 * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers. This is because the number of factors for a number can be found by adding 1 to the sum of the exponents of its prime factorization, assuming all exponents are at least 1. Since 5 is odd, Q must be a perfect fourth power (p^4) because only perfect powers have an odd number of factors.

Therefore, the correct statement is:

Q must be a perfect fourth power of a prime number.

 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer: Relative Speed: 55-52=3 mph

Question:A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
Answer:
Output:
Let the number of members be n.
Then, the ages of the members are 7, 10, 13, ..., (7 + 3(n - 1)).
The sum of an AP is given by the formula: S = (n/2)(first term + last term).
So, we have:
250 = (n/2)(7 + (7 + 3(n - 1)))
Simplifying the equation:
250 = (n/2)(14 + 3n - 3)
250 = (n/2)(11 + 3n)
500 = n(11 + 3n)
500 = 11n + 3n^2
3n^2 + 11n - 500 = 0

To solve for n, we can use the quadratic formula or try factoring. In this case, factoring works:
(3n - 25)(n + 20) = 0

This gives us two solutions: n = 25/3 and n = -20. Since the number of members cannot be negative, we take n = 25/3, but since the number of members must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number because the common difference is 3 months, which means we're counting every 3 months.

So, the number of members is 9 (since 25/3 rounded up is 9). However, since we're looking for the number of members in the club, which would typically include at least one person, we consider the next whole number after 9, which is 10.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given choices. The actual number of members would be 10.

Answer: Not among the given choices (none of the options).

Question:There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 105 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) 525
Answer:
Output:
The number of ways to choose 5 people out of 10 to form the first group is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen.

For the first group:
C(10, 5) = 10! / [5!(10-5)!] = 10! / [5!5!] = (10*9*8*7*6) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 252

Since the second group will consist of the remaining 5 members, there's only 1 way to choose them (as they are already determined).

To find the total number of ways to form both groups, we multiply the number of ways for the first group by the number of ways for the second group:

Total ways = Ways for first group * Ways for second group
Total ways = 252 * 1
Total ways = 252

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 252.

Question:I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Answer:
Output:
The number must end in 0, because if it ended in any other digit, putting a 1 at the beginning would make it smaller than putting a 1 at the end. So the number must be of the form xy0, where x and y are digits. With a 1 at the end, the number is 1000x + 10y + 0, and with a 1 at the beginning, it is 1 * 10000 + xy0 = 10000 + xy0. For the number to be three times larger with a 1 at the beginning, we must have:

10000 + xy0 = 3(1000x + 10y)
10000 + xy0 = 3000x + 30y

Subtracting xy0 from both sides gives:

10000 = 3000x - 2990x + 30y - 10y
10000 = 100x + 20y

Since x and y are digits, the smallest possible value for x is 1 and the smallest possible value for y is 0. Therefore, the smallest 5-digit number that satisfies the condition is 10000. If we put a 1 at the end, we get 11000, which is indeed three times larger than 10000.

Question:64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
Answer:
Output:
The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so let's assume that the number of boys who joined is x, and the number of girls who joined is also x.

Initial number of boys: 64
Initial number of girls: 40

After joining:
Number of boys: 64 + x
Number of girls: 40 + x

The ratio of boys to girls remains 4:3, so we can set up the equation:

(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3

Now, solve for x:

3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
3x - 4x = 160 - 192
-x = -32
x = 32

So, both boys and girls joined by 32.

New number of boys: 64 + 32 = 96
New number of girls: 40 + 32 = 72

Total number of members = New number of boys + New number of girls
Total number of members = 96 + 72 = 168

The group now has 168 members.

Question:In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
Answer:
Output:
Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, let's assume the smallest possible value for the four-digit number to be 1000 (as it's the smallest 4-digit number). In this case, the maximum number of students would be just below 10000.

2. The number of students studying math is \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the total, so for 1000 students, it would be \( \frac{1000}{16} = 62.5 \), which rounds down to 62 students.
3. For 1000 students, the number studying bio would be \( \frac{1000}{10} = 100 \) students.
4. And for 1000 students, the number studying English would be \( \frac{1000}{8} = 125 \) students.

Now, let's find the maximum number of students possible. We can't have a fraction of a student, so we'll round up the math and bio students to the nearest whole number and keep the English students as is since they're already whole numbers.

- Math: 63 students
- Bio: 101 students
- English: 125 students

The total maximum number of students would be 63 + 101 + 125 = 309 students.

For the minimum number of students, we'll round down all the fractions:

- Math: 62 students
- Bio: 100 students
- English: 124 students

The total minimum number of students would be 62 + 100 + 124 = 306 students.

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 309 - 306 = 3 students.

However, since the question asks for the difference to be a 4-digit number, we need to consider that the actual total number of students must be at least 1000. Therefore, the smallest possible total number of students would be 1001, and the calculations would be slightly different:

- Math: \( \frac{1001}{16} \approx 62.56 \) → 63 students
- Bio: \( \frac{1001}{10} = 100.1 \) → 100 students
- English: \( \frac{1001}{8} = 125.125 \) → 125 students

Now, the total minimum number of students would be 63 + 100 + 125 = 308 students.

The difference between the maximum (309) and minimum (308) in this case is 1 student, which is not a 4-digit number. Since the original question specified that the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we need to increase the minimum number to ensure it's a 4-digit number.

Let's increase the total number of students to 10000 and redo the calculations:

- Math: \( \frac{10000}{16} = 625 \) students
- Bio: \( \frac{10000}{10} = 1000 \) students
- English: \( \frac{10000}{8} = 1250 \) students

The new total minimum number of students would be 625 + 1000 + 1250 = 3075 students.

The difference between the maximum (309) and the new minimum (3075) is 3075 - 309 = 2766 students.

None of the given answer choices match the calculated difference. However, the closest choice is 8880, which is not the correct answer based on the problem constraints.

Since the problem specifies a 4-digit difference and the provided answer choices do not align with the calculations, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given options.

Question:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
Answer:
Output:
To be relatively prime with 1000, a number must have no factors in common with 1000. The prime factorization of 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3. So, a number will be relatively prime with 1000 if it has no 2's or 5's in its prime factorization.
There are 1000 numbers from 1 to 1000, inclusive. Out of these:
- For the number to have no 2's, it must be an odd number. There are 500 odd numbers (1 to 1000, excluding 500).
- For the number to have no 5's, it must not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. There are 400 numbers ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 (100, 101, ..., 999).
However, we've counted the numbers that have no 2's and no 5's twice (those ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). These are the numbers that are coprime with 1000 and have no common factors other than 1. There are 400 such numbers.

So, the probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 1000 is relatively prime to 1000 is the number of coprime numbers divided by the total number of numbers:

Probability = Number of coprime numbers / Total numbers
Probability = 400 / 1000
Probability = 2 / 5

The answer is D.

Answer:
Output:
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 10. When this sum is a perfect square, it must be a multiple of 100. The only option that satisfies this condition is 91, since 91 is a perfect square (10^2 - 9^2) and is the sum of consecutive odd numbers (45 + 47 + 49 + 51 + 53).

Let's denote the unknown number as \( x \). According to the problem, the number is both greater than 36 by some amount and less than 86 by the same amount. This can be expressed as:

\[ x - 36 = 86 - x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 86 + 36 \]
\[ 2x = 122 \]
\[ x = \frac{122}{2} \]
\[ x = 61 \]

So, the correct answer is \( 61 \).

Question:A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 18 (D) 20 (E) 30
Answer:
Output:
To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to consider that a book can belong to only one category at a time. Since there are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books, the total number of unique books is 30 + 20 = 50. However, some of these books may be counted twice because they are both hardcover and fiction.

The maximum overlap occurs when all 20 fiction books are also hardcover, as this would result in the highest count of books that are both categories. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

Question:Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 25 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 21
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote Ajay's current age as \( A \) and Sachin's current age as \( S \).

According to the problem:
1. \( S - 10 = 2(A - 10) \) (Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back)
2. \( S + 10 = 40 \) (Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years)

From equation 2, we can find \( S \):
\( S = 40 - 10 \)
\( S = 30 \)

Now, substitute \( S \) into equation 1 to find \( A \):
\( 30 - 10 = 2(A - 10) \)
\( 20 = 2A - 20 \)
\( 40 = 2A \)
\( A = 20 \)

So, Ajay is currently 20 years old.

Question:Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
Answer:
Output:
To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to consider the minimum attendance for both events.

The minimum attendance for the prom night is 45%, and for the debating session is 35%. Since these events are not mutually exclusive (some students may attend both), we can add these percentages together to find the maximum attendance for either event:

45% + 35% = 80%

This means that at most, 80% of the students did participate in either the prom or the debating session. To find the maximum number who didn't do either, we subtract this percentage from 100% (the total population):

100% - 80% = 20%

Now, we multiply this by the total number of students to find the maximum number who didn't attend either event:

20% of 200 students = 0.20 * 200 = 40 students

However, since we're looking for the maximum number that could have done neither, we round down to the nearest whole number, as it's not possible to have a fraction of a student:

40 students

The closest answer choice that matches this is (B) 81, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer should be less than 40 students because we rounded up to 40 in our calculation. The only choice less than 40 is (A) 27.

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 27.

Question:For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
Answer:
Output:
If x is the number of copper coins and y is the number of brass coins, then
20x + 25y = 340
Divide both sides by 20:
x + 2.5y = 17
We need to find the smallest value of x, so let's check the options starting from the smallest:

If x = 0, then 2.5y = 17, and y = 17 / 2.5 = 6.8, which is not an integer (since coins cannot be in decimal).
If x = 1, then 2.5y = 17 - 20 = -3, which is also not an integer.

Since we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins, we continue with the next option:

If x = 2, then 2.5y = 17 - 40 = -23, which is still not an integer.

Let's try x = 3:
2.5y = 17 - 60 = -43
This is also not an integer.

Now let's try x = 4:
2.5y = 17 - 80 = -63
Again, not an integer.

However, if we increase x by 1 again, we get:
x = 5
2.5y = 17 - 100 = -83
Now, if we divide -83 by 2.5, we get a non-negative integer:
y = (-83) / 2.5 = -33.2

Since y must be a whole number, we can't have x = 5. We need to go back to the previous value of x that gives an integer for y:

x = 4
2.5y = 17 - 80 = -63
y = (-63) / 2.5 = -25.2

Again, y is not an integer. However, if we decrease x by 1, we get:
x = 3
2.5y = 17 - 60 = -43
y = (-43) / 2.5 = -17.2

Now, y is a negative integer, but since we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins, we can't have a negative number of coins. Therefore, we should consider the next lower value for x:

x = 2
2.5y = 17 - 40 = -23
y = (-23) / 2.5 = -9.2

This is still not an integer, but if we decrease x by 1 again:
x = 1
2.5y = 17 - 50 = -33
y = (-33) / 2.5 = -13.2

Now, y is a negative integer, but as mentioned earlier, we need a non-negative integer for the number of brass coins. Since we've reached the smallest value for x that doesn't result in a whole number for y, we can conclude that the minimum number of copper coins the diver could have brought is 1.

The correct answer is D.

Answer:
Output:
The ratio of green sweets to red sweets is 4:3. This means for every 4 parts of green sweets, there are 3 parts of red sweets. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, we can set up the following proportion:

Green sweets : Red sweets = 4 : 3
4 parts = 120 sweets

To find the number of red sweets, we calculate 3 parts using the same ratio:

Red sweets = (3/4) * 120
Red sweets = 3 * 30
Red sweets = 90

So, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Question:Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
Answer:
Output:
Let the distance between X and Y be D km. Since both Allen and Bob travel at constant speeds, they will cover equal distances in the same time interval.

1. When they first meet, both have traveled half the distance (D/2) from their respective starting points.
2. After the first meeting, Allen continues to Y and then back to X, while Bob goes from Y to X and then back to Y. They will meet again when they have each traveled a full round trip, which is D km for Allen and 2D km for Bob.

The time taken for the second meeting can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For Allen:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Allen}} = \frac{D + D}{54} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Allen}} = \frac{2D}{54} \]

For Bob:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Bob}} = \frac{2D + 2D}{78} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Bob}} = \frac{4D}{78} \]

Since they meet at the same time, we set their times equal:
\[ \frac{2D}{54} = \frac{4D}{78} \]

Now, solve for D:
\[ 2D \cdot 78 = 4D \cdot 54 \]
\[ 156D = 216D \]
\[ D = \frac{216}{156}D \]
\[ D = \frac{54}{39}D \]
\[ D = \frac{6}{13}D \]

Divide both sides by D (assuming D ≠ 0):
\[ 1 = \frac{6}{13} \]

This implies that the distance D is 13 times the extra distance Bob travels during the second part of the journey. Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we can find D as follows:

\[ D = 13 \times 48 \]
\[ D = 624 \]

However, since the answer choices do not include 624, there might be an error in the problem statement or answer choices provided. Assuming the correct distance should be within the given options, the closest choice would be 144 km, which is 13 times 12 km.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 144 km.

Answer:
Output:
The rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds, or w/(25x) gallons per second. To find the number of seconds it would take for y gallons to pass, you would set up the equation y=w/(25x)*t, where t is the number of seconds. Solving for t, you get t=y*(25x)/w. To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60, so t=y*(25x)/w / 60 = 5xy/(12w) minutes.

Question:A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the initial speed of the jeep as \( v \) km/hr. In the forward journey, the jeep travels at this speed for 6 hours, so the distance \( D \) can be calculated as:

\[ D = v \times 6 \]

For the return journey, the speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the new speed is \( v + 12 \) km/hr. It takes 4 hours to travel the same distance \( D \) back, so we have:

\[ D = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Since the distance is the same in both directions, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

\[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]

Now let's solve for \( v \):

\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]
\[ 6v - 4v = 48 \]
\[ 2v = 48 \]
\[ v = 24 \]

Now that we have the initial speed, we can find the distance for either the forward or return journey, since they are the same:

\[ D = v \times 6 \]
\[ D = 24 \times 6 \]
\[ D = 144 \text{ km} \]

The correct answer is (B) 144 km.

Answer:
Output:
8 men complete the work in 6 days, so the total men-days required to complete the work is 8 men * 6 days = 48 men-days. To find out how many men are needed to complete the work in 1/2 day, we divide the total men-days by the number of days:

48 men-days / (1/2 day) = 48 men-days * 2 days = 96 men

So, 96 men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day.

Question: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer: Relative Speed: 55-52=3 mph

Question:Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Answer:
Output:
In 26 min, A makes 2 rotations, so in 1 min A makes 2/26 rotations. => In x minutes A makes x*(2/26) rotations.
Similarly, in 35 min, B makes 5 rotations, so in 1 min B makes 5/35 rotations. => In y minutes B makes y*(5/35) rotations.
For A and B to be at the same starting point again, x*(2/26) rotations = y*(5/35) rotations.
=> 13x = 14y => x/y = 14/13.
The least common multiple of 13 and 14 is 182, so after 182 minutes A and B will be at the same starting point again.
182 minutes = 3 hours and 4 minutes.
So, the earliest they will be at the same starting point again is 3 hours and 4 minutes later, which is closest to 3 hour and 31 minutes.

Question:Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
Answer:
Output:
Let the distance between A and B be x miles.
Time taken by Kevin to cover distance between A and B at 70mph = x/70 hours.
Time taken by Kevin to cover distance between B and A at 90mph = x/90 hours.
Total time taken = x/70 + x/90 = 3x/630 = x/210 hours.
Since, 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it, he must have covered (x-70) miles in 3 hours at a speed of 90mph.
Therefore, 3 = (x-70)/90 => x = 270.

Question:Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the number of toys Alex made as \( A \) and the number of toys Jacob made as \( J \).

Given:
- Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy.
- Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy.
- Together they made 35 toys in total.

We can set up two equations based on the information provided:

1. Time taken by Alex to make \( A \) toys: \( 7A \)
2. Time taken by Jacob to make \( J \) toys: \( 9J \)

Since they worked for almost similar number of hours, let's assume the total time they worked is \( T \). Since they made 35 toys together in a month, the total time taken for all toys is \( 35 \times (7 + 9) \) hours.

So, we have:
\[ 7A + 9J = T \]
\[ 35 \times (7 + 9) = T \]

Now, we'll solve for \( T \):
\[ T = 35 \times 16 \]
\[ T = 560 \text{ hours} \]

Since \( A + J = 35 \), and we know the total time they worked, we can find out how many hours each worked and then use that to find out how many toys Jacob made:

\[ 7A + 9J = 560 \]
\[ 7(35 - J) + 9J = 560 \]
\[ 245 - 7J + 9J = 560 \]
\[ 2J = 560 - 245 \]
\[ 2J = 315 \]
\[ J = \frac{315}{2} \]
\[ J = 157.5 \]

Since the number of toys must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number because Jacob cannot make a fraction of a toy:

\[ J = 157 \]

However, this is not among the given answer choices. There seems to be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices provided. The closest option would be 15, but since the actual number of toys Jacob made should be more than 157 (since he worked for a similar amount of time as Alex), the correct answer would not be 15.

Given the options, there seems to be an issue with the choices provided. If the question is correct, there should be an option for 157 or a higher number. Without a correct choice, we cannot definitively answer the question.

Question:A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
The car moves along a line towards the base of the tower. At the beginning, the angle between the line and the ground is 45 degrees. When the angle changes to 60 degrees, the car has moved 45 degrees worth of distance closer to the tower. To find out how long it takes for the car to move those 45 degrees, we can use the fact that the car's speed is constant.

Let's denote the speed of the car as \( v \) and the distance it covers at an angle of 45 degrees as \( d \). Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, we have:

\[ d = v \times t \]

The distance \( d \) can also be expressed in terms of the angle \( \theta \) and the height of the tower \( h \), using trigonometry:

\[ d = \frac{h}{\tan(45^\circ)} = h \]

Since \( \tan(45^\circ) = 1 \), the distance \( d \) is equal to the height of the tower \( h \).

Now, when the angle changes to 60 degrees, the car has covered another \( 45^\circ \) to reach the base of the tower. Therefore, the total time \( T \) taken to cover both angles is:

\[ T = \frac{45^\circ + 45^\circ}{v} \]

Since \( d = h \) and \( h = v \times t \), we can substitute \( h \) for \( d \) in the time equation:

\[ T = \frac{90^\circ}{v} = \frac{90^\circ}{h/v} = \frac{90}{h} \times \frac{v}{1} \]

We know that \( h = d = v \times 10 \) (10 minutes), so:

\[ T = \frac{90}{v \times 10} \times v = \frac{9}{10} \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

The car has already spent 10 minutes, so the additional time it will take to reach the base of the tower is:

\[ 9 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]

However, since time cannot be negative, the car will actually reach the base of the tower in 1 less than the time it took to cover the initial 45 degrees, which is:

\[ 10 \text{ minutes} - 1 \text{ minute} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

This corresponds to option E, "None of these" because the given choices do not include 9 minutes.

Question:Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the time it takes Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city as \( T_{train} \) and by car as \( T_{car} \).

According to the problem:
1. \( T_{train} + T_{car} = 17 \) hours (for the round trip)
2. \( T_{train} - T_{car} = 4 \) hours (since he loses 4 hours when going both ways by train)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously:

Adding the equations gives us:
\( 2T_{train} = 17 + 4 \)
\( 2T_{train} = 21 \)
\( T_{train} = \frac{21}{2} \)
\( T_{train} = 10.5 \) hours

Substituting \( T_{train} \) into the first equation:
\( 10.5 + T_{car} = 17 \)
\( T_{car} = 17 - 10.5 \)
\( T_{car} = 6.5 \) hours

Now, if he had traveled by car both ways, the total time would be:
\( 2T_{car} = 2 \times 6.5 \)
\( 2T_{car} = 13 \) hours

The answer is (E) 13 hours.

Question:At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
Answer:
Output:
The space shuttle covers a distance equal to its height in 40 seconds, and in addition, it takes 5 seconds to pass a point. This means that in 45 seconds (40 + 5), the shuttle covers both its height and an additional length equal to its own length.

Let's denote the length of the space shuttle as \( L \). In 45 seconds, the shuttle travels a total distance equal to its height plus its length:

\[ 700\text{ m} + L = \text{distance covered in 45 seconds} \]

Since the shuttle travels at a constant speed, we can calculate the distance covered in 45 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

\[ \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 700\text{ m/s} \times 45\text{ s} \]

Now let's solve for \( L \):

\[ 700 \times 45 + L = 700 \times 45 \]
\[ L = 700 \times 45 - 700 \times 45 \]
\[ L = 0 \]

However, this result doesn't make sense because the shuttle must have some non-zero length. There seems to be an error in the problem statement or the given answer choices, as the length cannot be zero. Given the options, the most reasonable assumption would be that the question is asking for the length of the shuttle when it's traveling at its maximum speed, which is the height it covers in 40 seconds:

\[ L = 700\text{ m} \]

So, the correct answer should be 700 meters, but since that option isn't provided, the closest choice would be (B) 75 m, which is the next largest value.

Question:A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
Answer:
Output:
The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade in one revolution is equal to the circumference of the circle formed by the blade. Given that the radius of the circle is 10 cm, the circumference (C) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ C = 2\pi r \]
\[ C = 2\pi \times 10 \]
\[ C = 20\pi \text{ cm} \]

Since the fan makes 300 revolutions in 30 seconds, we need to find the total distance traveled in 30 seconds. We multiply the circumference by the number of revolutions:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = C \times \text{Revolutions} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 20\pi \times 300 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 6000\pi \text{ cm} \]

The answer choices are in terms of \( \pi \), so we can simplify \( 6000\pi \) by recognizing that \( 6000 \) is divisible by \( 1000 \) (since \( 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000 \)):

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 6 \times 1000\pi \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 6000\pi \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \( 6000\pi \), which corresponds to choice D.

Question:The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
Answer:
Output:
Let's solve the problem step by step.

The total earnings for the 15-day period can be calculated by multiplying the average daily wage by the number of days:
Total earnings for 15 days = Average wage per day * 15 days = $90/day * 15 days

Now, let's find the total earnings for the first 7 days and the last 7 days separately:
Earnings for first 7 days = $87/day * 7 days
Earnings for last 7 days = $92/day * 7 days

To find the wage on the 8th day, we need to know the earnings up to that day and then subtract the earnings from the first 7 days and the last 7 days since they include the 8th day.

Wage on the 8th day = Total earnings for 15 days - (Earnings for first 7 days + Earnings for last 7 days)

Let's do the calculations:

Total earnings for 15 days = $90/day * 15 = $1350
Earnings for first 7 days = $87/day * 7 = $609
Earnings for last 7 days = $92/day * 7 = $644

Wage on the 8th day = $1350 - ($609 + $644)
Wage on the 8th day = $1350 - $1253
Wage on the 8th day = $97

The correct answer is (D) $97.

Question:In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
Answer:
Output:
The probability of the man catching the first train is the probability that the train on the main line arrives first, which is 2 minutes earlier than the harbor line. Since the frequency of both lines is 10 minutes, the probability of the main line train arriving first is 2/10 or 0.2.

However, since the main line train starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02, the man has a head start of 2 minutes. In those 2 minutes, the main line train could have already arrived once (every 10 minutes). Therefore, the actual probability of catching the first train is 1 (catching the first main line train) minus the probability of missing it by 2 minutes, which is 1 - (2/10) = 0.8.

The probability is 0.8, which corresponds to answer choice B.

Question:A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
Answer:
Output:
Mr.Brown works for 8 days and completes 8/6 = 4/3 of the houses.
Mr.Black works for 6 days and completes 6/8 = 3/4 of a house.
Together they have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 20/12 + 9/12 = 29/12 of the houses.
There are 3 houses in total, so Mr.Blue has to complete 3 - 29/12 = 36/12 - 29/12 = 7/12 of the houses.
Mr.Blue takes 12 days to complete one house, so he will take 12 * 7/12 = 7 days to complete 7/12 of the houses.

Question:Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
Answer:
Output:
Let x be the number of white sharpeners, then (18-x) would be the number of brown sharpeners. According to the problem:

x (white sharpeners) = x + 1 (since each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more)
(18 - x) (brown sharpeners) = (18 - x)

The total cost is 100 rupees:

x(x + 1) + (18 - x)(18 - x) = 100

Expanding and simplifying:

x^2 + x + (18 - x)^2 = 100
x^2 + x + (324 - 36x + x^2) = 100
2x^2 - 35x + 224 = 0

Dividing by 2 to simplify:

x^2 - 17.5x + 112 = 0

Factoring:

(x - 8)(x - 14) = 0

So, x can be either 8 or 14. Since there must be a total of 18 sharpeners, x cannot be 14 (because that would mean 14 white and 0 brown), so x = 8.

Therefore, Jack bought 8 white sharpeners and 18 - 8 = 10 brown sharpeners.

The answer is A (10, 8).

Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the cover price per issue as \( C \). According to the problem, a 15-issue subscription costs $42.00, which is 75% (100% - 25%) of the total cover price for all 15 issues. We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.75 \times 15C = 42.00 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \):

\[ 15C = \frac{42.00}{0.75} \]
\[ 15C = 56.00 \]
\[ C = \frac{56.00}{15} \]
\[ C = 3.73\]

The cover price per issue is $3.73.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) $3.73.

Question:A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 270 (B) 300 (C) 280 (D) 320 (E) 315
Answer:
Output:
Let's solve the question step by step.

Profit percentage = 20%
Selling price (SP) = Rs. 360

To find the cost price (CP), we can use the formula:

SP = CP + (Profit percentage * CP)

We know SP and the profit percentage, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for CP:

CP = SP / (1 + Profit percentage)

First, convert the profit percentage to a decimal:

20% = 0.20

Now, plug in the values:

CP = 360 / (1 + 0.20)
CP = 360 / 1.20

Now, calculate the cost price:

CP = 300

The cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

The correct answer is (B) 300.

Question:The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
Answer:
Output:
The question asks for the total discount, which is the sum of the two discounts. The first discount is 20%, and the second discount is also 20% of the discounted price, not the original price.

Let's denote the original price as \( P \). After the first discount of 20%, the price becomes:
\( P - 0.20P = 0.80P \)

Now, the second discount of 20% is applied to this discounted price:
\( 0.80P - 0.20 \times 0.80P = 0.80P \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P \times 0.80 = 0.64P \)

The total discount is the difference between the original price and the final price after both discounts:
\( P - 0.64P = 0.36P \)

This represents a 36% discount, since it's 36% of the original price.

So, the correct answer is (E) 36%.

Let's solve this step by step. The salesperson earns a 10% commission on each sale, which means they earn 0.10 * $250 = $25 for each sale.

To find out how many sales are needed to reach a salary of at least $1000, we divide the desired salary by the commission per sale:

$1000 / $25/sale = 40 sales

Question:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
Let the cost price of each pen be x.
Then, total quantity delivered = 7200 pens.
Quantity manufactured = 7200 pens / (1 - 0.10) = 8000 pens.
Profit = 25% of 8000x = 2000x.
Selling price per pen = Rs. 10.
Total selling price = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72000.
Manufacturing cost per pen = x = (total selling price - profit) / quantity manufactured = Rs. (72000 - 2000x) / 8000.
Substituting x = (72000 - 2000x) / 8000, we get x = 6.
Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 6.
The answer is A.

Question:In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) s.5050 (B) s.5723 (C) s.5040 (D) s.4950 (E) s.4870
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the original selling price of the article as \( x \). With a 20% discount, the customer pays 80% of the original price.

So, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.8x = 4578 \]

To find the original selling price \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.8:

\[ x = \frac{4578}{0.8} \]
\[ x = 5722.5 \]

The actual selling price before the discount was Rs.5722.5, but since we need to choose the closest option among the given choices, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is Rs.5723.

The closest answer choice is B.

Question:A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the original price of an item as \( P \). After applying a 20% discount, the selling price for one day would be:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = P - 0.20P = 0.80P \]

To return to the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase the discounted price by \( x\% \), where \( x \) is the percentage increase needed. The new price after the increase would be:
\[ \text{New Price} = 0.80P + 0.01x \times 0.80P \]
Since we want this to equal the original price \( P \), we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.80P + 0.01x \times 0.80P = P \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 0.80 + 0.01x \times 0.80 = 1 \]
\[ 0.80 + 0.0080x = 1 \]
\[ 0.0080x = 1 - 0.80 \]
\[ 0.0080x = 0.20 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.20}{0.0080} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 25%.

The correct answer is (C) 25%.

Question:An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the number of employees as \( E \).

According to the problem, the original contribution per employee was \( \frac{6,00,000}{E} \) rupees.

If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been \( 6,00,000 + 60E \) rupees.

This total contribution should equal Rs. 6,24,000, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 6,00,000 + 60E = 6,24,000 \]

Now, let's solve for \( E \):

\[ 60E = 6,24,000 - 6,00,000 \]
\[ 60E = 24,000 \]
\[ E = \frac{24,000}{60} \]
\[ E = 400 \]

So, there are 400 employees in the organization.

The correct answer is (C) 400.

Question:In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
Answer:
Output:
The answer is C. The number of tagged deer in the sample of 500 is 20, which is 20/500=4%. Since this is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population, we can set up the equation:
Number of tagged deer / Total population = Tagged deer in sample / Sample size
4% = 20 / Total population
Total population = 20 / 0.04 = 5000

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 5000.

Question:Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 60 (C) 28 (D) 26 (E) 18
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote Mark's money as M and John's money as J. According to Mark's statement:

\[ M + \frac{1}{2}J = 75 \]

According to John's statement:

\[ M - \frac{1}{3}J = 75 \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. First, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[ 2M - \frac{2}{3}J = 150 \]

Now, we can add this new equation to the first one to eliminate M:

\[ (M + \frac{1}{2}J) + (2M - \frac{2}{3}J) = 75 + 150 \]
\[ 3M - \frac{1}{6}J = 225 \]

Now, multiply the first equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction in the second equation:

\[ 3(M + \frac{1}{2}J) = 3 \cdot 75 \]
\[ 3M + \frac{3}{2}J = 225 \]

Now we can equate the two expressions for 3M:

\[ 3M + \frac{3}{2}J = 3M - \frac{1}{6}J \]

Add \(\frac{1}{6}J\) to both sides:

\[ \frac{3}{2}J + \frac{1}{6}J = 3M \]
\[ \frac{9}{6}J + \frac{1}{6}J = 3M \]
\[ \frac{10}{6}J = 3M \]
\[ \frac{5}{3}J = 3M \]

Since we know that \( M + \frac{1}{2}J = 75 \), we can substitute \( 3M \) with \( \frac{5}{3}J \):

\[ \frac{5}{3}J + \frac{1}{2}J = 75 \]
\[ \frac{10}{6}J + \frac{3}{6}J = 75 \]
\[ \frac{13}{6}J = 75 \]

Now, solve for J:

\[ J = \frac{75 \times 6}{13} \]
\[ J = \frac{450}{13} \]
\[ J = 34.615 \]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a rupee, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 34 rupees. However, this is not among the given answer choices. It seems there might be an error in the provided options or the problem statement. Given the calculations, John originally had approximately 34 rupees, but since the answer choices do not match, we cannot definitively choose one.

Question:In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
Answer:
Output:
Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.
2. The remaining 90% are vanilla flavored since there are only two flavors (vanilla and cocoa).
3. Out of these 90%, 90% are not squashed because the question states that 90% of the rest (vanilla) are not squashed.

To find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed, we calculate 90% of the 90% vanilla chocolates:

\( 90\% \times 90\% = 0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81 = 81\% \)

However, this includes both vanilla and squashed chocolates as well as vanilla and not squashed chocolates. Since we want only the ones that are both vanilla and not squashed, we need to subtract the squashed portion from the total vanilla.

Since 10% are cocoa, the remaining 90% are vanilla. And 90% of these are not squashed, so 10% must be squashed (because 100% - 90% = 10%). So, 81% includes the 10% squashed vanilla chocolates.

Subtracting the squashed portion from the total vanilla gives us the percentage that are both vanilla and not squashed:

\( 81\% - 10\% = 71\% \)

The closest choice to 71% among the given options is 70% (which is not listed), but since the answer choices are not precise, we can choose the closest option that is less than 71%. The closest is 5%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 5%, which corresponds to choice (C).

Question:A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
The formula for calculating simple interest is I = PRT/100, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time duration.
In this case, the merchant wants to find the highest interest rate (R) that allows him to pay the invoice within the discount period without having to pay any interest (since the discount is applied to the original price).
The invoice is for $20,000 with terms of 4/30, which means the merchant has 4 days to pay and still get the 10% discount. This is equivalent to 4/30 of a year, or approximately 0.1333 years (4/30 * 365 days/year).
The discounted price would be $20,000 - 10% of $20,000 = $20,000 - $2,000 = $18,000.
To find the maximum interest rate, we set the interest to zero because the merchant wants to pay the discounted price without any additional charges:
0 = PRT/100
0 = $18,000 * R * 0.1333
0 = $2,400 * R
R = 0 / $2,400
R = 0

Since the interest rate cannot be negative, the merchant can afford to borrow at a rate of 0%, which is not among the given choices. Therefore, the correct answer is E: None of these.

Question:Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer:
Output:
Median of a set with even number of terms is the average of middle two terms. If there are 4 members, median would be average of 2nd and 3rd member's income. Hence, there cannot be 4 members. If there are 5 members, median would be third member's income. So, 3rd member's income should be $3000. But we don't know about other members' income. So, there can be 5 members with median income as $3000 if other two members' income is zero. So, the answer is D. The answer is D.

Question:Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the population of Boomtown one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, if the annual growth rate is 10% for two years, the population after two years would be:
\[ P \times (1 + 0.10)^2 \]

It's given that this will be double the population one year ago, so:
\[ P \times (1 + 0.10)^2 = 2P \]

Now, let's solve for the growth rate over the last year:
\[ (1 + 0.10)^2 = 2 \]
\[ 1.10^2 = 2 \]
\[ 1.21 = 2 \]

So, the population increase over the last year is approximately \( 1.21 - 1 = 0.21 \), or 21%.

The closest answer choice to 21% is (B) 40%.

Question:In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the original maximum mark as \( M \) and the converted maximum mark as \( 800 \).

According to the problem, the candidate secured 504 marks out of \( M \), and if \( M \) were converted to 800 marks, they would have secured 420 marks.

We can set up the following equation based on the proportion of marks:

\[
\frac{504}{M} = \frac{420}{800}
\]

Now, we solve for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{504 \times 800}{420}
\]

\[
M = \frac{403200}{420}
\]

\[
M = 960
\]

So, the value of \( M \) is 960.

The correct answer is (E) 960.

Question:At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
Answer:
Output:
Let's solve this step by step. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, we can use the formula for compound interest with two compounding periods per year:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the final amount ($54,080),
- \( P \) is the principal amount (what we want to find),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (0.08 or 8%),
- \( n \) is the number of times interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual compounding),
- \( t \) is the time in years (1).

We can plug these values into the formula and solve for \( P \):

\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]
\[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^2 \]
\[ 54,080 = P \left(1.04\right)^2 \]
\[ 54,080 = P \times 1.0816 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.0816 to isolate \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \]

Calculating this gives us:

\[ P \approx \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \approx 50,000 \]

So, the original amount Charles invested is approximately $50,000.

The correct answer is (B) $50,000.

Question:You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
Answer:
Output:
cents. If the cost of one energy bar is the same as the cost of a soda, how many cents does a soda cost?
Answer: Let's denote the cost of one soda as \( S \) cents and the cost of one energy bar as \( B \) cents. According to the given information:

1. \( S + 2B = 150 \) (Cost of one soda and two energy bars)
2. \( 2S + 3B = 300 \) (Cost of two sodas and three energy bars)

Since the cost of one energy bar is the same as the cost of a soda, we have \( B = S \).

Now we substitute \( B \) with \( S \) in the equations:

1. \( S + 2S = 150 \)
2. \( 2S + 3S = 300 \)

Simplifying both equations:

1. \( 3S = 150 \)
2. \( 5S = 300 \)

Dividing both sides by the respective coefficients of \( S \):

1. \( S = \frac{150}{3} \)
2. \( S = \frac{300}{5} \)

\( S = 50 \) cents

So, a soda costs 50 cents.

Question:One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E as \( V_E \) and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A as \( V_A \).

According to the problem, 1 gram of the health food provides:
- 9% of \( V_E \) for vitamin E
- 8% of \( V_A \) for vitamin A

To meet the minimum daily requirements, we need to find the amount \( X \) of the health food that would give us at least \( V_E \) and \( V_A \) grams of each vitamin.

For vitamin E:
\[ 0.09X \geq V_E \]

For vitamin A:
\[ 0.08X \geq V_A \]

Since we want to find the minimum amount of food, we can set up an equation based on the fact that we need to meet or exceed the minimum requirements for both vitamins:

\[ 0.09X + 0.08X \geq V_E + V_A \]
\[ 0.17X \geq V_E + V_A \]

However, we don't have specific values for \( V_E \) and \( V_A \), so we cannot solve for \( X \) directly. We can express the answer in terms of these unknowns. The question asks for the minimum amount of food, so we look for the smallest value of \( X \) that satisfies the inequality.

The correct answer choice should be the smallest number among the given options that makes the inequality true. Since the requirements are percentages of the minimum daily requirements, the smaller the percentage, the larger the amount of food needed to meet the requirement. Among the given choices, \( 12.5 \) (C) is the smallest number that could potentially satisfy the inequality because if \( X \) were less than 12.5, then \( 0.17X \) would be less than the combined minimum requirements.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 12.5 grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

Question:A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
Let the present ages of Mohan and Sohan be x and y respectively.
Then, x = 23, y = 24.
Let Mohan's share be Rs. P.
Then, Sohan's share = Rs. (5100 - P).
Mohan's share = Rs. P will be received by him after (26 - 23) years = 3 years.
Sohan's share = Rs. (5100 - P) will be received by him after (26 - 24) years = 2 years.
Now, P(1 + 4/100)^3 = (5100 - P)(1 + 4/100)^2
P(104/100)^3 = (5100 - P)(104/100)^2
P = (5100 - P) * 104/100
100P = 5100 * 104 - 104P
204P = 5100 * 104
P = 5100 * 104 / 204
P = 5100 * 26 / 51
P = 26 * 100
P = Rs. 2600.

Answer:
Output:
The length of the ribbon is reduced in the ratio 5:3, which means for every 5 parts of the original length, 3 parts remain. Since the original length was 30 cm, we can divide it into 5 + 3 parts:

30 cm / (5 + 3) = 30 cm / 8 = 3.75 cm per part

Now, to find the new length with 3 parts remaining:

3.75 cm/part * 3 parts = 11.25 cm

However, since the length cannot be in decimal, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 12 cm.

The correct answer is E: 12 cm.

Question:A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the length of the longer piece of rope as \( L \) and the length of the shorter piece as \( S \). According to the problem:

\[ L + S = 20 \text{ meters} \] (since the rope is cut into two pieces that together make up the original 20 meters)

It is also given that one piece is 3 meters shorter than the other:

\[ L = S + 3 \]

Now we can substitute \( S + 3 \) for \( L \) in the first equation:

\[ (S + 3) + S = 20 \]
\[ 2S + 3 = 20 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 17 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ S = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5 \text{ meters} \]

Since \( S \) is the length of the shorter piece, \( L \) (the length of the longer piece) is:

\[ L = S + 3 = 8.5 + 3 = 11.5 \text{ meters} \]

The correct answer is (D) 11.5 meters.

Question:A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
Answer:
Output:
The outer surface of the cube has 6 * 5 * 5 = 150 faces.
Each of the small cubes forms a part of 5 * 5 = 25 outer surfaces.
Thus, 150 / 25 = 6 surfaces of small cubes are painted.
So, 6 * 6 = 36 cubes have all their faces painted.
There are a total of (5 - 2) * (5 - 2) * (5 - 2) = 27 small cubes in the hollow cube.
Thus, 27 - 36 = -9 cubes have all their faces painted, which is not possible.
Hence, there must be some error in the question or the options provided. Since no other option is given, I cannot provide a definitive answer without further clarification. However, based on the information given, the correct answer would be that all faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted, as the negative number doesn't make sense in this context.

Answer: There seems to be an error in the provided choices. The answer should be that all faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted due to the inconsistency in the question or options.

Question:The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
Answer:
Output:
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the side of the cube.
Volume of cube = s^3
Volume of sphere = (2/3)πr^3
Since r = s/2, volume of the sphere = (2/3)π(s/2)^3 = (1/3)πs^3
The ratio of the volumes is:
Cube's volume / Sphere's volume = s^3 / (1/3)πs^3 = 3 / π
The ratio is 3:π, which simplifies to 6:2π or 3:π (since 2π = 2 * π).
So, the correct answer is (D) 6: π.
