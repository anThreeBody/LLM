Romanzo Criminale typically refers to a 2013 Italian crime drama film, while Sweet Body Of Bianca doesn't have a widely recognized director linked to it in this context. Therefore, it's likely that the director of Romanzo Criminale, if known to be older, would be the one born first. However, without specific data, this is an educated guess.

However, since I am an AI and cannot access real-time data, I can't provide a definitive answer without specific birth dates. In this case, I can only assume that if one film's director was born after the other, it would be "Forest of Love" because the question implies that one film must have a later-born director than "The Nude Bomb." If you have the birth years of the directors, you could compare them to find the answer.
