Question:On November 22, who met with the Russian leader that visited the country where the Surzhyk dialect is spoken, when the protests were taking place?
Answer:
Output:
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an answer to this question without additional context or information. The question mentions two separate events that occurred on November 22 - the visit of a Russian leader to a country where the Surzhyk dialect is spoken, and protests taking place in that same country. However, there are many countries in the world where the Surzhyk dialect is spoken, so it is unclear which specific country is being referred to in this question. Additionally, the question does not provide any information about the identity of the person who met with the Russian leader, so it is impossible to determine whether they are related to the protests.

Question:How were the people that the Ajuran Empire declared independence from by minting coins expelled from Zaw Win Thet's country?
Answer:
Output:
The Ajuran Empire declared independence from the kingdom of Ava in the early 14th century by minting coins. The coins featured an image of the Ajuran ruler and inscriptions in the Burmese language.

Question:A country was in effective control of both political and military functions of the organization the People's Socialist Republic of Albania belonged to. When did this country agree to a unified Germany inside the organization that ran an annual event called Exercise Reforger?
Answer:
Output:
The People's Socialist Republic of Albania was a communist state that existed from 1946 until 1991. During this time, the country was effectively controlled by the Albanian Communist Party, which also held power over the military. 

As for Exercise Reforger, it was an annual multinational military exercise conducted by NATO member countries in Europe. The first Reforger exercise took place in 1976, and it continued until 1994. However, Albania did not participate in the exercise during its existence as a communist state.
