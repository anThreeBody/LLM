Input:
Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 2272, 875, divided by a 3-digit number N, same remainder, sum of digits of N.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation should be performed to find the remainder when dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N? 2. What does it mean for the remainders to be the same? 3. How can we find the digit sum of N? 4. Can we find N by itself without any other information? 5. What are the possibilities for the digit sum of N?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: To find the remainder when dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we would typically divide them together and check for the remainder. If the remainders are the same, then the number N must be a factor of both 2272 and 875. In other words, N must have a common factor with both numbers.

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bee, flowers, bypasses, 0.05%, nectar, 8 flowers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should we use to find out how many flowers the bee would typically fly by without bypassing any?2. What percentage of flowers does the bee actually inspect when it bypasses 8 flowers?3. How many flowers does the bee inspect before it bypasses one flower?4. Given the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, what fraction of the flowers it encounters represents those it bypasses?5. In order to find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, what formula can we apply using the given bypass rate?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option represents the total number of flowers the bee would inspect if it bypasses 8 flowers based on the given bypass rate?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the bee's flower inspection process, let's denote the total number of flowers as \( F \). According to the problem, the bee bypasses a certain percentage of flowers, which is given as 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \) (as a decimal). 1. To find out how many flowers the bee would typically inspect without bypassing any, we simply divide the total number of flowers by 1, so \( F \) flowers.2. When the bee bypasses 8 flowers, the percentage inspected is \( 100\% - 0.05\% \), which simplifies to \( 99.95\% \) of the flowers. To find the fraction, we divide this percentage by 100: \( \frac{99.95}{100} \).3. To find out how many flowers the bee inspects before bypassing one, we need to invert the bypass rate. Since the bee bypasses 0.05%, it inspects \( 100\% - 0.05\% = 99.95\% \) for each flower. Therefore, we can express this as \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \).4. The fraction of flowers bypassed is the bypass rate, which is 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \).5. To find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, we can set up the equation \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \). Solving for \( F \), we rearrange the terms and multiply both sides by 0.9995 to isolate \( F \).6. Once we solve the equation from step 5, we will get the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, denoted as \( T \).After performing the calculations, we find that:- The bee would inspect \( F \) flowers without bypassing.- It inspects \( \frac{99.95}{100} \) or approximately 99.95% of flowers per flower.- Before bypassing one flower, it inspects \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \) flowers.- The fraction of bypassed flowers is \( 0.0005 \).- The total number of flowers inspected before bypassing 8 is determined by solving \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \).The specific numerical values for the total number of flowers before bypassing 8 cannot be determined without knowing the total number of flowers (\( F \)) in the first place. However, the passage provides the steps needed to calculate it given \( F \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: identical bouquets, 28 white tulips, 98 red tulips, no flowers left out.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be formed from 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips?2. How many flowers are in each bouquet?3. What condition needs to be met for two bouquets to be considered identical?4. How can we represent the problem mathematically?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

  1. To find the maximum number of identical bouquets, we need to determine the smallest common multiple of the number of white and red tulips. The lcm (least common multiple) is the smallest number that is divisible by both 28 and 98. We can use the prime factorization method to find the lcm:
    - White tulips: 28 = 2^2 * 7
    - Red tulips: 98 = 2 * 7 * 7

We can then write the prime factorization of the lcm as:

    - LCM = 2^2 * 7 * 7 = 28 * 7 = 196

So, the maximum number of identical bouquets can be formed by dividing both sets of tulips by their common factor:

    - White tulips: 28 / 196 = 0.142857
    - Red tulips: 98 / 196 = 0.500000

As we cannot have a fraction of a bouquet, we round down to 0.500000, meaning we can create 1 bouquet from 28 white tulips and 50 red tulips.
2. Each bouquet contains 28/0.500000 = 56 flowers.
3. Two bouquets are considered identical when the number of red tulips is equal and the number of white tulips is also equal.
4. Mathematically, we can represent the problem as follows:

        f = w + r

where f represents the total number of flowers in the bouquet, w represents the number of white tulips, and r represents the number of red tulips. The condition for two bouquets to be identical is f = f'. Thus, we can write:

        f = 56 + 56

This equation implies that the total number of flowers in each bouquet must be equal, which results in:

        112 = 56 + 56

Solving for f, we get:

        f = 112

So, the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be formed is 112. 

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Input:
Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number? Answer Choices: (A) 84 (B) 66 (C) 28 (D) 19 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: one-third of 3/4 of a number, 21, find the number.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the number, one-third of 3/4 of the number, and 21?2. What does 3/4 represent in this context?3. What operation should be performed to convert 3/4 to a decimal?4. How many times does 3/4 appear in the given expression?5. Can we solve the problem by setting up an equation?6. If the given expression equates to 21, what value does the number represent?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Firstly, let's define the variables: Let the number be denoted as x. Then, we have the following equation: x/3 * 3/4 = 21.
We can rearrange the equation to solve for x: x = 21 * 4 * 3 / 3 / 4.
Next, we need to simplify the expression to convert 3/4 to a decimal: 3/4 = 0.75.
Now, the equation becomes: x = 21 * 4 * 0.75.
Finally, we can solve the equation to find the value of x: x = 21 * 3 = 63.
So, the number is 63.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:conference, team, 4 men, 4 women, presenters, chosen, different groups, composed of men only, women only, different if at least one presenter is different..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without restrictions?2. What is the formula for finding the number of combinations when selecting a certain number of items from a larger group, considering order does not matter?3. Who are the individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference?4. Where does the constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" apply in this problem?5. When is this constraint relevant - during the selection of presenters or after they have been chosen?6. Why is it important to consider the exclusion of teams with all men or all women in the selection process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without any restrictions, you would use the concept of permutations if order mattered or combinations if order was not significant. Since order doesn't seem to matter here, we'll use combinations. The formula for combinations (denoted as C(n, k)) is:C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)where n is the total number of individuals available and k is the number of presenters to choose.The individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference are all men and all women, regardless of gender. The constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" applies to the selection process itself.This constraint is relevant during the selection stage, as it prevents the formation of homogeneous teams. It ensures diversity in the composition of the presenting team. By excluding these specific combinations, the pool of potential presenters broadens, allowing for balanced teams with both men and women.Considering this exclusion is important because it reflects the desired balance and inclusivity in the conference's representation. If teams with all men or all women were allowed, it would violate the goal of having a diverse lineup of presenters. Therefore, the exclusion rule must be applied during the selection process to guarantee an appropriate mix of presenters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

Question:The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:The telephone bill, establishment, fixed, varies, number of calls, consumed, bill amount, Rs.1800, 540 calls, Rs.2040, 620 calls, another month, 500 units..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of mathematical operation is used to describe the relationship between the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill?2. What: How can we find the fixed cost of the bill if it's partly fixed and partly varies based on the number of calls made?3. Who: Which entity (establishment) is responsible for paying the varying portion of the telephone bill?4. Where: In what context does this situation take place, like a specific location or industry?5. When: During which time periods were the bills for 540 and 620 calls calculated? Are there any seasonal trends or regular billing cycles?6. Why: Why does the bill change with the number of calls consumed, and what is the basis for the variation? Is there a per-call or per-minute rate?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the fixed and variable components of a telephone bill is typically described using algebraic operations, specifically a linear equation. To determine the fixed cost, one would subtract the variable component, which is often based on the number of calls made, from the total bill amount. For instance, let's assume a basic formula: Total Bill = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per Call * Number of Calls).To find the fixed cost, given that the bill for 540 calls was $120 and another bill for 620 calls was $130, we can set up an equation. Let F be the fixed cost and C be the variable cost per call. The equation would look like:1. For 540 calls: F + (C * 540) = 1202. For 620 calls: F + (C * 620) = 130Subtracting the fixed cost from both equations will isolate the variable cost per call:C = (130 - 120) / (620 - 540) = $0.10 per call.Now we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find the fixed cost:F + (0.10 * 540) = 120F = 120 - 54F = $66So, the fixed cost is $66, and the variable cost per call is $0.10. This billing scenario takes place in the telecommunications industry, where the cost structure is commonly structured with a base fee and additional charges per usage. The bills are calculated monthly, reflecting regular billing cycles, and the costs vary depending on the number of calls made, following a per-call pricing model.

Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: election meeting, 10 speakers, protocol, pm, mp, mla, ways to hold the meeting.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the first speaker to be selected in the order of protocol? 2. What is the second speaker to be selected? 3. How many times does the MP appear in the order of protocol? 4. How many times does the MLA appear in the order of protocol? 5. What is the total number of possible combinations if we consider the constraints of the protocol?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: Protocol specifies that the PM speaks before the MP and the MP speaks before the MLA. Therefore, the first two speakers are the PM and MP, respectively. After them, the MLA appears once. The third speaker can be any of the remaining eight speakers, so there are 8 options. The fourth speaker can be any of the remaining seven speakers, leaving 7 options. And so on, until the tenth speaker, who can be any of the remaining six speakers. The total number of possible combinations would be the product of the number of choices for each position: C(10, 1) * C(9, 1) * C(8, 1) * C(7, 1) * C(6, 1) * C(5, 1) * C(4, 1) * C(3, 1) * C(2, 1) * C(1, 1) = 10! / (1! * 9! * 8! * 7! * 6! * 5! * 4! * 3! * 2! * 1!) = 10! / (3! * 6!) = 10! / (2 * 3!) = 10!/2.

Question:A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n?
 Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:box, balls, marked successively, 1 to n, 45 different ways, two balls selected, ball with number 3 marked, not selected, value of n.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of ways two balls can be selected from the box without considering ball 3?2. How many balls are initially in the box if we need to find the combinations without selecting ball 3?3. What type of counting principle is involved in determining the number of combinations when one item is excluded?4. In how many ways can two balls be selected from the box if all balls are distinct and numbered from 1 to n-1?5. Given that the selection of ball 3 is prohibited, how does this restriction affect the total number of possible pairs from the remaining balls?6. What is the relationship between the value of n and the answer choices provided (A, B, C, D, E), indicating the correct number of balls in the box?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the total number of ways to select two balls from a box without considering ball 3, we employ the combination formula. The formula for combinations is C(n-1, k-1), where n represents the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. Since we want to exclude ball 3, we effectively have n-1 balls to choose from (n being the initial number). If we let k be 2, the calculation becomes C(n-1, 1) or simply (n-1) since there's only one way to choose one ball from the remaining n-1.To find the initial number of balls, we need to consider that we're looking for combinations without selecting ball 3. This implies that there must be n-1 balls in the box, as ball 3 is accounted for in the exclusion.The counting principle involved here is the "Rule of Combinations with Exclusion," which states that when one item is excluded, you subtract the number of combinations with the excluded item from the total number of combinations without any restrictions.If all balls are distinct and numbered from 1 to n-1, the number of ways to select two balls would be C(n-1, 2), which simplifies to (n-1) * (n-2) / 2 using the combination formula.Given that ball 3 is prohibited, the total number of possible pairs from the remaining balls is reduced by one, so it's C(n-1, 2) - 1.In terms of the answer choices A, B, C, D, and E, if the correct number of balls in the box corresponds to the value of n that makes the calculated result match one of those choices, then we need to evaluate each choice against the formula for combinations without considering ball 3. The relationship between n and the answer choices will depend on the specific values provided in the options, as different n values will lead to different combinations.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: M, N, abc, cba, greater than, M-N+396c=990.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the difference between M and N?2. Is the difference between M and N positive or negative?3. What is the value of c in the equation M-N+396c=990?4. How many different values of M can satisfy the given condition, considering that M is a three-digit number?5. How many values of M are more than 300?

We can analyze the question as follows:

From the given equation M - N + 396c = 990, we can see that M - N is a three-digit number. So, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of M - N that satisfy the equation and compare them with the number 300 to determine the number of values of M that are more than 300.

Since M > N, we can write:

M = N + d (where d is a positive integer)
Substituting this into the equation:
N + d + 396c = 990

Now, we need to find the values of N and d that make the above equation true. To do this, we can start by solving for N:

d = 990 - M - N
Substituting this into the equation:
M + (990 - M - N) + 396c = 990
Simplifying:
2M - N + 396c = 990

Next, we can simplify further:

2M = N + 990 - 396c
2M - N = 990 - 396c

Dividing both sides by 2:
M - N = 495 - 198c

Now, we need to find the range of values of M - N that satisfy the equation. We can substitute M - N with 495 - 198c in the equation:

495 - 198c + 396c = 990
396c = 505
c = 505/396

Since c is a fraction, we cannot have an integer value for it, which means that there are no integer values of c that satisfy the equation.

Now, we can substitute c back into the equation M - N = 495 - 198c to get:

M - N = 495 - 198(505/396)
M - N = 495 - 505
M - N = -10

Since M - N is a three-digit number, we can conclude that there are no solutions for M and N.

Therefore, the answer is E: None of the values of M are more than 300.

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3.

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition.

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: sum of digits, three-digit number, sum of squares of digits, subtracting 495, same digits written in reverse order, number.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation is used to find the sum of the digits of a three-digit number?2. What is the relationship between the sum of the digits and the sum of their squares?3. How can we use the fact that the sum of the digits is 17 to determine the value of the number?4. How does subtracting 495 affect the digits of the number?5. What happens when we reverse the digits of the number?6. Can we find the number by combining these steps?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:We know that the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17. Let's denote the number as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit. Then, we can write down the following equation: A + B + C = 17Similarly, the sum of the squares of the digits is given as follows: A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109. We can rearrange this equation to solve for C: C^2 = 109 - A^2 - B^2Since the number is a three-digit number, the possible values for A and B are 0 to 9. For any given combination of A and B, we can calculate the corresponding C. However, we need to ensure that the resulting number has the same digits written in reverse order after subtracting 495. We can express this requirement mathematically as follows: ABC - 495 = ACB (since we're reversing the digits).Substituting the expression for C from the previous step into the second equation, we get: A^2 + B^2 - (109 - A^2 - B^2) = 495Subtracting the two equations, we obtain: 2 * A^2 = 495, which implies A^2 = 247. Solving for A, we get A = ±√247. Since A is a three-digit number, it must be positive, so A = √247. Substituting this value into the equation for C, we get C = 109 - 247 - √247^2 = -138. Since C cannot be negative, we discard this solution. Now, we need to check the other possible solutions: when A = 247, B = 0, and C = 7, the sum of the digits is indeed 17, and the sum of the squares of the digits is 109. However, when we subtract 495 from this number, we get 2470 - 495 = 1975, which doesn't have the same digits written in reverse order. So, the only solution is A = 247, B = 0, and C = 7. Therefore, the number is 24707.

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Question:The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Joe, Joe's sister, Joe's father, age, the sum of their ages.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation represents the relationship between the ages of Joe, his sister, and his father? 2. How can we calculate the current age of Joe's sister given that she will be twice as old as now when Joe is as old as his father? 3. What is the relationship between Joe's father's current age and the ages of Joe and his sister when they are the same age? 4. In what context does the problem take place? 5. When does the age difference between Joe and his father become relevant to determine his father's current age? 6. Why is it important to consider Joe's sister's future age in the calculation?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: When the sum of Joe's age, his sister's age, and his father's age equals 100, we can represent the relationship between them using the following equation:Joe's Age + Joe's Sister's Age + Father's Age = 100We can use the fact that Joe will be as old as his father when he is twice as old as his sister. This means that when Joe's age is equal to his father's current age, his sister's age will be twice her current age. Let's denote the current age of Joe as J, his sister's current age as S, and his father's current age as F. Therefore, we can write the following equations:

J + S + F = 100
S = 2J
F = 2S

Solving these equations simultaneously:
J + 2J + 2*2J = 100J + 4J = 100J = 60
S = 2*60 = 120

From this point, we can determine the father's current age:
F = 2S = 2*120 = 240

However, the problem states that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as now. This means that when Joe is 60 years old, his sister will be 120 years old. So, Joe's sister's current age is 60 years old, and his father's current age is 240 years old.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Question:A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, Rs.40,000, 2 months, B, Rs.60,000, C, Rs.120,000, total profit, Rs.375,000, C's share, Rs.150,000, join the business.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation(s) would you use to find out A's share of the profit before C joined?2. What calculation would you perform to find the total investment made by A and B together when they initially joined?3. Who received the majority of the total profit before C's involvement?4. In what timeframe (in months) did B invest, considering the given timeline?5. How much was the combined investment of A and B when C joined?6. Using the information about C's share and the total profit, how would you calculate the duration between B and C joining the business?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine A's share of the profit before C joined, we would first need to find the total profit generated by the business during that period. Let's denote the initial profit as P_initial. If A's share is A_profit and B's share is B_profit, then the relationship between their shares could be represented by the equation:A_profit + B_profit = P_initialSince we don't have exact figures for A's and B's shares, we can't provide an exact amount. However, to find the total investment made by A and B together initially, we would add their individual investments, which are given as A_investment and B_investment:Total_initial_investment = A_investment + B_investmentThe majority of the total profit before C's involvement would go to the person with the highest share. As per the information provided, we can assume that A had a higher share than B, so A received the majority.B invested for 6 months, as given in the timeline. To find the total investment made by B during this time, we multiply B_investment by the number of months:B_total_investment = B_investment * 6 monthsWhen C joined, the combined investment of A and B became A_investment + B_investment + C_investment. The total profit after C joined, denoted as P_final, was shared among A, B, and C. C's share, denoted as C_profit, can be found using the same formula as above:C_profit = (P_final - P_initial) / 3Now, to calculate the duration between B and C joining, we can use the fact that B invested for 6 months before C joined. This means:Duration_B_C = B_total_investment_time + C_investment_timeUnfortunately, without specific numerical values for the investments and profits, we cannot provide exact calculations. But the steps outlined above would allow you to perform the necessary calculations once you have those numbers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Club, members, ages, AP series, common difference, youngest member, sum of ages, 250.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the formula for finding the number of terms in an AP series given its first term, last term, and common difference?2. How do we find the sum of an AP series?3. How does the youngest member's age relate to the age of the oldest member in an AP series?4. Can we calculate the age of the oldest member directly from the information provided?5. Is the given sum of ages sufficient to determine the number of members in the club?6. What is the relationship between the sum of ages and the common difference in an AP series?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:In an arithmetic progression (AP) series, the number of terms (n) can be calculated using the formula n = (Last Term - First Term) / Common Difference + 1Using the information provided, we have the following values:First term = Youngest member's age = 7Last term = Sum of ages = 250Common difference = Age difference between consecutive terms = 3Therefore, we can calculate the number of terms in the AP series as follows: n = (250 - 7) / 3 + 1n = 77However, knowing the number of terms alone is not enough to determine the number of members in the club, as the common difference may vary. To find the number of members, we would need to know the specific ages of each member in the AP series. Without this information, we cannot provide an exact answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not available.

 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If 6x - y = 24 and y = 3x, what is the value of x? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 9 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 6x - y = 24, y = 3x.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How can we substitute the value of y in the first equation to solve for x? 2. What is the relationship between x and y in the second equation? 3. How can we use the relationship between x and y in the second equation to solve for x in the first equation? 4. Are there any constraints or assumptions about the values of x and y that may affect the solution? 5. What would happen if the given relationships were not true? 6. How can we verify that the answer is correct?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
Substituting y = 3x in the first equation, we get:
6x - (3x) = 24
Simplifying, we obtain:
3x = 24
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 8

Therefore, the value of x is 8.

We can also use the relationship between x and y in the second equation to verify our answer:
y = 3x
Substituting x = 8, we get:
y = 3(8)
y = 24

This confirms that x = 8 is the correct solution.

There are no constraints or assumptions about the values of x and y that would affect the solution, as long as they satisfy the relationships provided in the problem.

Since we found the same value for x when using two different methods, we can confidently state that x = 8 is the correct answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 8.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction).

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Question:The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Greatest common factor (GCF), Least common multiple (LCM), two positive integers, 11, 7700, 350, other integer.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the GCF and LCM of two integers?2. How does knowing the GCF and LCM help us find the other integer?3. What is the smallest number that divides both 11 and 7700?4. Can we find the other integer without any information about its value?5. What is the connection between the given integers and the value of 350?6. Based on the options provided, which integer is the other integer in the pair?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage: The greatest common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM) are inversely related to each other. Specifically, if the GCF of two numbers is g, then their LCM is lcm(g, n), where n is the other number in the pair. Knowing that the GCF of two integers is 11, we can determine the LCM as follows:   \( LCM(11, n) = 11 * lcm(11, n) / 11 \) The value of lcm(11, n) is 7700. To find n, we need to solve for it by plugging in the LCM value into the equation:   \( 7700 = 11 * lcm(11, n) / 11 \)   Simplifying the equation, we get:   \( 7700 = lcm(11, n) \) Now, we know that the GCF of two integers is 11 and their LCM is 7700. The smallest number that divides both 11 and 7700 is 11, since the LCM is equal to the product of the two numbers multiplied by their GCF. Knowing that the other integer is also a positive integer, we can use the LCM formula again to find its value:   \( n = lcm(11, 7700) / 11 \)   Plugging in the known values, we get:   \( n = 7700 / 11 = 700 \)
Step 4: Based on the given information, the other integer in the pair is 700.

 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

Question:There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 10 steps, stair, A boy, either one or two steps, ways.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation can be used to find the number of ways to climb up the stairs? 2. What formula can be used to calculate the number of ways when given the options of taking either one or two steps at a time? 3. Who is the subject climbing the stairs? 4. Where does the problem take place? 5. When would this type of calculation be useful? 6. What is the relationship between the number of options and the number of ways?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: The number of ways to climb up 10 steps, given the option of either taking one or two steps at a time, can be calculated using the combination formula. Let's denote the number of steps taken as "x" and the number of times the boy chooses to take two steps as "y." Then the number of ways he can climb the stairs can be expressed as x + 2y.
Using the combination formula:
C(x + y, y) = x! / (y!(x-y)!)
Substituting x = 10 and y = 0, we get:
C(10 + 0, 0) = 10! / (0!(10-0)!) = 10!
C(10, 0) = 10 ways to climb all 10 steps at once.
Substituting x = 10 and y = 1, we get:
C(10 + 1, 1) = 10! / (1!(10-1)!) = 10! / (1!9!) = 10 * 9 = 90
C(10, 1) = 9 ways to climb 10 steps by taking two steps at a time and then one step at a time.
Substituting x = 10 and y = 2, we get:
C(10 + 2, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 10! / (2!8!) = 10 * 9 * 8 = 720
C(10, 2) = 72 ways to climb 10 steps by taking two steps at a time twice and then one step at a time.
Summing up the results, the total number of ways A boy can reach the top of the stairs is:
10 + 9 + 72 = 81 ways.
However, we must consider that this includes cases where the boy takes all 10 steps at once, which is not possible since he has only two options. So, we subtract the number of ways he can reach the top by climbing all 10 steps at once:
81 - 10 = 71 ways.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:probability, Stock A, increase in value, next month, probability, Stock B, increase in value, next month, greatest value, probability, neither of these two events, occur.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the probability that neither event occurs?2. What is the relationship between the probabilities of Stock A and Stock B increasing in value that we need to consider?3. Who or what is being measured in this scenario (the probability of Stock A and Stock B not increasing)?4. In what context are these probabilities calculated - individual stocks or a portfolio?5. When does the calculation of the probability that neither event occurs become relevant?6. Why is it important to find the greatest value for the probability that neither event happens?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of finance and investing, the probability of events concerning individual stocks or a portfolio is often analyzed to assess risk and potential returns. To calculate the probability that neither event occurs, we use the concept of complementary events. If we denote the probability of Stock A increasing in value as P(A) and the probability of Stock B increasing as P(B), the probability that neither stock increases can be found using the formula:1. The operation used for this is the multiplication of the probabilities of the complementary events not happening, which is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)). This is because the probability of both events not occurring is the product of the probabilities that each event does not occur individually.2. The relationship between the probabilities of Stock A and Stock B increasing is crucial because they are negatively correlated. If one stock has a higher chance of increasing, it implies that the other might have a lower chance, and vice versa. Investors need to consider this diversification aspect when determining the overall portfolio risk.3. In this scenario, the probability of Stock A and Stock B not increasing in value is what's being measured. This is an indicator of the likelihood of a loss or no return for the combined investment in these stocks.4. These probabilities are calculated for individual stocks, as well as for a portfolio where they might be combined, to evaluate the collective risk and optimize asset allocation.5. The calculation of the probability that neither event occurs becomes relevant during risk management, portfolio optimization, or decision-making for investors who want to minimize losses and maximize potential gains.6. It is important to find the greatest value for the probability that neither event happens because a higher probability indicates a lower likelihood of simultaneous positive returns on both stocks. This helps investors make more conservative decisions or diversify their investments to reduce the overall portfolio risk. By understanding these probabilities, investors can better manage their expectations and strategies.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: quadratic equation, x^2, -5x, k, real roots, distinct roots.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the discriminant and the number of real roots of a quadratic equation?2. How can we identify the discriminant of the given quadratic equation?3. How do we find the largest value of 'k' that guarantees the existence of two distinct real roots?4. What are the roots of the quadratic equation when 'k' takes this maximum value?5. What is the meaning of the discriminant in the context of this problem?6. What is the purpose of finding the largest value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:For a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is given by b^2 - 4ac. The discriminant provides valuable information about the nature of the roots of the equation, specifically whether it has two real roots, one real root, or no real roots. To find the discriminant of the given equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0, we can rearrange it as follows:x^2 - 5x + k = 0 -> x^2 - 5x = -kWe can then factor out the common term x and find the discriminant:b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(-1)(-k) = 25 + 4kFor the equation to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero. Therefore, we can write the inequality:25 + 4k > 0Solving for k, we get k > -25/4This means that the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is 8, which corresponds to k = 8.

Question:Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

What is the concept used to calculate the number of arrangements when dividing objects into distinct sets?3. Who are the subjects involved in creating the groups, and how many combinations can they make with the lime soda bottles?4. In what situation does the table play a role in distributing the bottles?5. When does the size of the groups become significant in determining the number of arrangements?6. How can we relate the information about the number of lime soda bottles to the total number of arrangements?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In this problem, we are trying to find the number of ways to divide ten lime soda bottles among two groups of 5 members each. We can use the combination formula to solve this, which is C(n,r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen. Here, n = 10 (lime soda bottles) and r = 5 (number of members per group). Applying the formula: C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)C(10, 5) = (10*9*8*7*6) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 252Thus, there are 252 ways to create the two groups with 5 members each and ten lime soda bottles.

Question:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sharon, 5 hours, Karen, 4 hours, buy the cake together..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long Sharon and Karen work together before they can afford the cake?2. How many total hours of work do Sharon and Karen have combined?3. Who works longer initially, Sharon or Karen, and by how many hours?4. In what situation does the combined work hours of Sharon and Karen equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone?5. When they work together, after how many hours will their combined earnings equal the cost of the cake?6. What is the mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together based on their individual work hours?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Sharon and Karen are saving up to buy a cake that costs $24. Each hour, Sharon earns $8, while Karen earns $6 per hour. To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.
 Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, eat, fruit (breakfast), vegetable (dinner), 6 different types of fruit, 8 different types of vegetables, eat one type at a time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of combinations when selecting one type of fruit for breakfast?2. How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: assistants, prepare, large cakes, small cakes, kitchen, hours, 3 hours, 20 large cakes, 700 small cakes, required.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many hours are available in the kitchen?2. What is the total number of cakes that need to be prepared?3. How many large cakes are needed in total?4. How many small cakes are needed in total?5. How many large cakes can each assistant make per hour?6. How many small cakes can each assistant make per hour?7. How many assistants are required to prepare all the cakes in the given time?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
1. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
2. The total number of cakes that need to be prepared is 20 large cakes + 700 small cakes = 720 cakes.
3. There are 20 large cakes needed in total.
4. There are 700 small cakes needed in total.
5. Each assistant can make 2 large cakes per hour.
6. Each assistant can make 35 small cakes per hour.
7. We need to find the number of assistants required to prepare all the cakes in the given time.

Step 4: To find the number of assistants required, we can divide the total number of cakes by the number of cakes each assistant can make per hour. For large cakes, we have 720 cakes / 2 assistants = 360 cakes/hour. For small cakes, we have 700 cakes / 35 assistants = 20 cakes/hour. Since each assistant can make both large and small cakes, we can combine the two numbers to find the total number of cakes prepared per hour: Total cakes prepared per hour = 360 cakes/hour + 20 cakes/hour = 380 cakes/hour.

Step 5: Now, we need to find the number of assistants required to complete the task within the available time. We can do this by dividing the total number of cakes needed by the total cakes prepared per hour: Number of assistants required = Total cakes needed / Total cakes prepared per hourNumber of assistants required = 720 cakes / 380 cakes/hour = 2 assistants.

Therefore, among the given options, the answer is A: 8.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 33 (C) 35 (D) 42 (E) 58
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. We want to find the smaller number.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the original ratio of the two numbers?2. How much has been subtracted from each number?3. What is the new ratio after the subtraction?4. What is the smaller number in the new ratio?5. Is the difference between the original ratio and the new ratio equal to the difference between the larger number and the smaller number?6. Can you find the smaller number by using the given information?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We know that the two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, meaning that for every 3 units of one number, there are 5 units of the other number. Let's call the smaller number "s" and the larger number "l".
Since 9 is subtracted from each number, the new ratio becomes s + 9:s - 9 = 12:23.
Multiplying both sides by s, we get s^2 - 9s + 9 = 12s - 234.
Dividing both sides by s, we get s^2 - 3s - 33 = 0.
Using the quadratic formula, we find s = (3 ± sqrt(33))/2.
Since s represents the smaller number, we choose the positive root, so s = (3 + sqrt(33))/2.
Therefore, the smaller number is approximately 21.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

In what context does the problem of finding the recorded property worth occur (e.g., financial records, real estate)?5. When might the recorded property worth have been documented, considering the given information?6. Why is it necessary to find the difference between the actual and recorded property worths?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the greatest positive even integer that is less than or equal to $1023.65, we need to divide the decimal by 2 and round down to the nearest whole number. Since 1023.65 is already slightly more than an even number, we simply subtract 0.65 from it, then divide by 2. 1. \( 1023.65 - 0.65 = 1023 \)2. \( 1023 \div 2 = 511.5 \)3. Rounding down, we get \( 511 \) as the greatest even integer. So, the operation performed is \( 1023 \mod 2 = 1 \), which means 1023 is not divisible by 2, and hence not by 100.To determine if a number is divisible by 100, you check if it ends in both 0s. If the last two digits of the number are 00, it is divisible by 100.For the second question, we can use the divisibility rule: if a number's last two digits form a number that is divisible by 100, the original number is divisible by 100.In the context of the problem, the recorded property worth is likely found in financial records or real estate documents. It represents the assessed value of a property for tax purposes or for transactions.The recorded property worth would have been documented at the time of the most recent assessment, which might have occurred annually or during property transactions, based on local regulations.Finally, finding the difference between the actual and recorded property worths is crucial because it helps identify any discrepancies, undervaluation, or potential tax adjustments. This comparison ensures fairness and accuracy in property taxation or valuations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A computer routine was developed to generate two numbers (x,y) the first being a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the second being less than or equal to the square root of the first. Each of the following pair satisfies the routine except
 Answer Choices: (A)  (99,10)  (B)  (85,9)  (C)  (50,7)  (D)  (1,1)  (E)  (1,0)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
The property of the number can be expressed mathematically as follows:
3 * (number with 1 after it) = number with 1 before it + 1

So, we can write the equation as:
3 * (number with 1 after it) = number with 1 before it + 1
3 * number with 1 after it = number with 1 before it

Solving for the number with 1 after it, we get:
number with 1 after it = (number with 1 before it + 1) / 3

We also know that the number must be a five-digit number, so let's assume the number with 1 before it is "abcd", where a is the thousands digit, b is the hundreds digit, c is the tens digit, d is the ones digit, and e is the decimal place digit.

Plugging in the values for "abcd" into the equation above, we get:
3 * (1000a + 100b + 10c + d + e) = (1000a + 10b + c + d) + 1

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
3000a + 300b + 30c + 3d + 3e = 1000a + 10b + c + d + 1

Rearranging the terms, we get:
2700a + 270b + 27c + 27d = 1000a + 10b + c + d

Subtracting 2700a + 270b + 27c + 27d from both sides, we get:
700a + 60b + 6c + d = 0

Since a, b, c, and d are integers, the left-hand side cannot be zero. Therefore, there is no solution to this equation, and the given property is impossible for a five-digit number.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two-digit number, exceeds, sum of digits, digit at the unit's place, double the digit in the ten's place, 18.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation should be performed to determine the digit at the unit's place in the two-digit number?2. What is the relationship between the digit at the unit's place and the digit in the ten's place?3. How many units are there in the two-digit number?4. What operation should be performed to determine the digit at the ten's place in the two-digit number?5. What is the difference between the two-digit number and the sum of its digits?6. What is the significance of the sum of the digits in this problem?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a two-digit number, the digit at the unit's place represents the ones and the digit at the ten's place represents the tens. So, we need to perform addition and subtraction operations to determine the digits of the number. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, then the two-digit number would look like this:$$\text{Number} = 10\times(d_{10}) + d_{unit}$$Where $d_{10}$ is the digit at the ten's place and $d_{unit}$ is the digit at the unit's place. Let's call the sum of the digits "S".Then, according to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can write:$$\text{Number} > S + 18$$Substituting the expression for S from step 2 into the inequality:$$10\times(d_{10}) + d_{unit} > S + 18$$Rearranging the terms:$$10\times(d_{10}) + d_{unit} - S > 18$$Since the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, we can rewrite the expression as:$$10\times(d_{10}) - 2\times(d_{10}) + d_{unit} > 18$$Combining like terms:$$8\times(d_{10}) + d_{unit} > 18$$The unit's digit must be greater than 18/8, which simplifies to 2. Thus, the digit at the unit's place is 2. Now we know that the digit at the ten's place is double the digit at the unit's place, so it must be 4. Therefore, the two-digit number is 42.

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Who are the individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference?4. Where does the constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" apply in this problem?5. When is this constraint relevant - during the selection of presenters or after they have been chosen?6. Why is it important to consider the exclusion of teams with all men or all women in the selection process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without any restrictions, you would use the concept of permutations if order mattered or combinations if order was not significant. Since order doesn't seem to matter here, we'll use combinations. The formula for combinations (denoted as C(n, k)) is:C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)where n is the total number of individuals available and k is the number of presenters to choose.The individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference are all men and all women, regardless of gender. The constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" applies to the selection process itself.This constraint is relevant during the selection stage, as it prevents the formation of homogeneous teams. It ensures diversity in the composition of the presenting team. By excluding these specific combinations, the pool of potential presenters broadens, allowing for balanced teams with both men and women.Considering this exclusion is important because it reflects the desired balance and inclusivity in the conference's representation. If teams with all men or all women were allowed, it would violate the goal of having a diverse lineup of presenters. Therefore, the exclusion rule must be applied during the selection process to guarantee an appropriate mix of presenters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Boys, Girls, Group, Social Work, Membership Drive, Same number of boys and girls joined the group, Ratio of boys to girls, 4:3, Members.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many boys and girls initially joined the group?2. What is the new ratio of boys to girls after the same number join?3. How many new members joined the group?4. How many members are there in the group now?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. After the same number of boys and girls joined, the new ratio of boys to girls would be 4:3. This means that the number of boys increased by 4/7 of the initial number of boys, while the number of girls increased by 3/7 of the initial number of girls. To find the total number of new members, we can set up the following equations:New number of boys = (4/7) * 64New number of girls = (3/7) * 40The new number of members = New number of boys + New number of girlsNew number of members = (4/7) * 64 + (3/7) * 40Now, we can find the total number of members in the group now:Total number of members = Initial number of boys + Initial number of girls + New number of membersTotal number of members = 64 + 40 + (4/7) * 64 + (3/7) * 40Total number of members = 64 + 40 + 64 + 30Total number of members = 278

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: kindergarten school, teacher, group of 3 children, Susan, Tim, Zen, chairs, arrangement, straight line, Susan on the left of Tim.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation represents the placement of the children on the chairs?2. What are the possible arrangements when all three children sit on the same chair?3. How many arrangements are possible when the teacher wants Susan to sit on the left of Tim?4. Can the order of the children be changed while maintaining the arrangement?5. How many ways can the teacher arrange the children when they sit on two chairs?6. Are there any restrictions that need to be considered when calculating the number of arrangements?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage: In a kindergarten school, a teacher wants to arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line. The problem asks us to determine the number of ways Susan can be placed on the left of Tim, given that the teacher wants this arrangement. We can approach this problem by first considering the general case of arranging the children on the chairs, then looking at the restrictions that prevent Tim and Zen from sitting directly next to each other. The arrangement of the children on the chairs can be represented by permutations, which are arrangements of objects where the order matters. For instance, if there are 3 chairs and 3 children, the number of permutations is C(3, 3) = 3! = 6.

When all three children sit on the same chair, there is only one way to arrange them: SSU, TTT, ZZZ.

However, when the teacher wants Susan to sit on the left of Tim, we can consider a similar permutation: SUT. This arrangement implies that Tim sits between Susan and Zen, and the others can be arranged in any order. Now, let's look at the cases where Tim and Zen are not allowed to sit directly next to each other. If Tim sits on the leftmost chair, there are 2 chairs left for Zen and Susan. They can be arranged in either ZSU or USZ. If Tim sits on the second chair, there are 1 chair left for Susan and 2 chairs for Zen. In this case, Zen can be arranged in either ZS or SZ. So, the total number of ways to arrange the children with Susan on the left of Tim is 2 * 2 = 4 arrangements. Therefore, the number of ways the teacher can arrange the children in a straight line with Susan on the left of Tim is 4. 

However, if Tim and Zen are allowed to sit directly next to each other, there is only one way to arrange them: TTS. This leaves one chair for Susan, who can be arranged in any of the remaining 2 positions. Therefore, the total number of ways the teacher can arrange the children with Susan on the left of Tim in this case is 2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Question:There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election?
 Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:a 90% chance, registered voter, Burghtown, last election, five registered voters, randomly chosen, exactly four, likelihood.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting in the last election, given a 90% chance?2. What is the probability of a single randomly chosen registered voter from Burghtown not voting in the last election, if 90% did vote?3. Who are the subjects of interest in this problem - the voters or the selection of five voters? 4. In which town does this scenario take place - Burghtown?5. When is the event being discussed - the last election?6. Why is it important to find the likelihood of exactly four out of five voters voting - for statistical analysis or prediction purposes?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of a statistical analysis and prediction exercise, the last election held in the town of Burghtown serves as the focal point. Given that 90% of the registered voters participated in the election, we can apply the binomial probability formula to determine the probability of specific outcomes. To calculate the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting, we use the formula:P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)where:- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (voters voting) out of n trials (voters),- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also known as "n choose k"),- n = 5 (since there are five voters),- k = 4 (we want to find the probability of four voting),- p = 0.9 (90% chance of a voter voting).Plugging in the values, we get:P(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.9^4 * (1-0.9)^(5-4)P(X = 4) = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1P(X = 4) ≈ 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1P(X = 4) ≈ 0.32805So, the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting is approximately 32.81%.Conversely, to find the probability of a single randomly chosen registered voter not voting, given that 90% voted, we subtract the probability of voting from 1:P(Voter doesn't vote) = 1 - P(Voter votes) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1This means the probability of a single voter not voting is 10%.The subjects of interest in this problem are the voters themselves, as we are calculating probabilities based on their voting behavior. The scenario takes place in the town of Burghtown during the last election. The importance of finding the likelihood of exactly four out of five voters voting lies in understanding the distribution of voter turnout, which can be crucial for statistical analysis and making predictions about future elections.

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: voters, 20% not eligible to vote, two candidates, contesting, winning candidate, 15% of votes.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the percentage of eligible voters in the total population? 2. What is the total number of eligible voters? 3. What is the percentage of votes won by the winning candidate? 4. What is the total number of votes cast? 5. How many votes did the winning candidate get?

We can solve this problem by applying the following steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of eligible voters:
   - Not eligible voters = 20% = 0.2
   - Total voters = 5000
   - Eligible voters = Total voters - Not eligible voters = 5000 - 0.2 * 5000 = 4000

2. Calculate the total number of votes cast:
   - Total votes = Eligible voters * Percentage of eligible voters = 4000 * 0.9 = 3600

3. Calculate the percentage of votes won by the winning candidate:
   - Winning candidate gets 15% of the total votes cast = 0.15 * 3600 = 540 votes

4. Calculate the total number of votes won by the winning candidate:
   - Total votes won = Total votes cast * Percentage of votes won = 3600 * 0.15 = 540

Therefore, the total number of votes won by the winning candidate is 540. 

However, none of the options given match this value. This might be an error in the question or there may be some other factors that affect the number of votes won.

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
 Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:$8.50, cab fare, $3.50, first quarter-mile, 10 cents, additional quarter mile, maximum distance..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile?2. How much does the cab charge per additional quarter-mile?3. How many quarter-miles can be traveled with the initial $3.50?4. What is the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile?5. How many times will the additional charge of 10 cents be applied to reach the limit of $8.50?6. What is the maximum distance that can be reached by adding the cost of the first quarter-mile and the additional quarter-mile charges?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile, you would use the initial fare, which is $3.50. This covers the first part of the trip. The cab charges an additional 10 cents per quarter-mile after the first one. To find out how many quarter-miles the initial $3.50 covers, you divide the initial fare by the charge per quarter-mile:\( \frac{\$3.50}{\$0.10/quarter-mile} = 35 quarter-miles \)For the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile, you add the initial charge to the sum of charges for each subsequent quarter-mile up to the point where the fare exceeds the limit of $8.50. Since the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, we need to find out how many times this charge can be applied before reaching $8.50:Let x be the number of additional quarter-miles. The equation will be:\( \$3.50 + (x * \$0.10) = \$8.50 \)Solving for x:\( x = \frac{\$8.50 - \$3.50}{\$0.10} \)\( x = \frac{\$5.00}{\$0.10} \)\( x = 50 quarter-miles \)The additional charge will be applied 50 times to reach the limit.Now, to find the maximum distance that can be reached, we add the first quarter-mile to the total number of additional quarter-miles:\( 1 quarter-mile + 50 quarter-miles = 51 quarter-miles \)So, the total distance is 51 quarter-miles converted to miles, knowing that 1 mile equals 4 quarter-miles:\( 51 \frac{quarter-miles}{4} = 12.75 miles \)In summary, the cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50, the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, the initial $3.50 covers 35 quarter-miles, the formula for total fare beyond the first mile is the initial fare plus 10 cents per quarter-mile up to 50 quarters, resulting in a total fare of $8.50, and the maximum distance is 12.75 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Three consecutive integers, product, 727+728+729.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the relationship between the three consecutive integers? 2. How can we express the product of the three integers as 727+728+729? 3. What is the mathematical operation used to find the sum of the three integers? 4. What algebraic approach can be used to determine the sum of the three integers? 5. Who or what determines the sum of the three integers in this sequence problem? 6. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role? 7. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the sum of three consecutive integers?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: In this problem, we are asked to find the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. This implies that these integers must be consecutive and the product of these integers is a known value. To find the sum of the three integers, we can use the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In this case, the product of the three integers is 727+728+729 = 2174. We can use this formula to determine the value of n, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. Substituting l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we get n = 2S / (a + l). Plugging in the known values, we get n = 2 * 2174 / (727 + k). Solving for k, we get k = 2174 / (2 * 2174 + 727) - 727. This gives us k = 2. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 727, 728, and 729. To find the sum of these three integers, we simply add them together: 727 + 728 + 729 = 2174. So the sum of the three consecutive integers is 2174.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is 2174.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:students, school, more than 501, 20% physics, 28% math, least possible number of students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation can we perform to find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math if we know the percentages of students taking each subject?2. What: How can we combine the given percentages of students taking physics (20%) and math (28%) to find the maximum overlap without exceeding the total count of more than 501 students?3. Who: In this context, what entity is responsible for ensuring that the least possible number of students are accounted for twice (once in physics and once in math)?4. Where: The problem is set in a school, so how does this context affect the calculation of the least possible number of students?5. When: Is there a specific constraint related to the timeframe in which the school's student population could be determined? If not, why does it not matter in this case?6. Why: Why is finding the least possible number of students important in this situation? Does it relate to budgeting, class sizes, or another relevant factor?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario at a school, the mathematics department and physics department conducted a survey to determine student enrollment. To find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math, we need to perform a mathematical operation known as set intersection. By subtracting the percentage of students taking only one subject from the total, we can estimate the overlap. First, let's calculate the percentage of students taking either physics or math or both. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, we add these two percentages together (20% + 28% = 48%). However, since the total number of students cannot exceed 501, the overlap cannot account for more than this number. To avoid double-counting, we must subtract the sum of the percentages from 100% (the entire student population) and then find the intersection within the remaining 52% (100% - 48%).Now, let's assume that the overlap represents the least possible number of students taking both subjects. This implies that these students would not be counted twice in the physics and math counts. Therefore, the school administration, responsible for maintaining accurate records, is the entity ensuring this consistency.The context of the problem being set in a school affects the calculation because it provides the real-world setting where such enrollment data is typically gathered. However, there is no specific timeframe mentioned, and the calculation does not rely on a particular date, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.The importance of finding the least possible number of students taking both subjects lies in efficient resource allocation and planning. It ensures that when allocating budgets for resources like classrooms, instructors, or materials, the school does not overestimate the demand for combined courses, thereby making the allocation more precise and cost-effective.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: students, studying math, studying biology, studying English, total number of students, difference between maximum and minimum numbers.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation should be used to find the total number of students if 1/16, 1/10, and 1/8 are the percentages of students studying each subject?2. How do we find the maximum and minimum number of students?3. What mathematical operation can be used to determine the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students?4. Where does the information about the total number of students come into play?5. When does the problem become relevant?6. Why is the difference between the maximum and minimum important?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

- We need to use the principle of proportions to find the total number of students. Let's denote the total number of students as S. Since 1/16 of S students study math, 1/10 of S students study biology, and 1/8 of S students study English, we can write the following equations:
    - S * 1/16 = Math students
    - S * 1/10 = Biology students
    - S * 1/8 = English students
    
    We can solve these equations simultaneously by multiplying them together: S * (1/16) * (1/10) * (1/8) = Math students * Biology students * English studentsS = Math students * Biology students * English students * 64S = 64 * Math students * Biology students * English students

Now we need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students, which is the maximum value of S minus the minimum value of S. This can be done by setting up the inequality S > Max(S) - Min(S), where Max(S) and Min(S) are the maximum and minimum possible values of S, respectively.
The maximum possible value of S is achieved when all students study math, biology, and English, i.e., when the total number of students is a multiple of 64. The minimum possible value of S is achieved when all students study only one subject. Since 64 is the highest common factor of 16, 10, and 8, the maximum possible value of S will be the smallest multiple of 64 that can be formed by combining these three fractions:Max(S) = 64 * 1/16 * 1/10 * 1/8 = 1Max(S) = 1

The minimum possible value of S is achieved when all students study only one subject, i.e., when S = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1
Min(S) = 1

Substituting these values into the inequality, we get:1 > 1 - 1, which is true. Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 1.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Input:
Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1000p (B) 1500p (C) 2000p (D) 2500p (E) 30000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:phone manufacturer, crates, pallets, each pallet, phones, 4 crates.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of phones per crate?2. How many phones does one pallet hold?3. What is the relationship between the number of pallets and the number of phones in a crate?4. How many phones are there in 4 crates if each crate has the same number of pallets?5. Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now? Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 41 (C) 40 (D) 42 (E) 43
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Raj, Rahim, age, one-third as old as, 5 years back, 17 years old now.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between Raj and Rahim's ages 5 years ago?2. What is the age difference between Raj and Rahim 5 years ago?3. How much older is Raj than Rahim now?4. Can the age difference between Raj and Rahim be determined solely based on the given information?5. What is the connection between Raj's age and the age of Rahim now?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:When Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago, it means that Raj's age was 1 / 3 of Rahim's age at that time. To determine their ages 5 years ago, we would multiply the current age of Raj by 3 to find out what Raj's age would have been 5 years ago: Raj 5 years ago = 17 * 3 = 51 years old.Rahim's age 5 years ago would have been 51 * 3 / 4 = 38 years old.Raj is currently 17 years old, and we know that 5 years ago, he was 51 years old. The age difference between Raj and Rahim now is therefore 17 - 38 = -21 years, meaning Raj is 21 years younger than Rahim now.
The age difference between Raj and Rahim cannot be determined solely based on the given information. If we were to have known the current age of Rahim, we could subtract Raj's current age from Rahim's current age to find the age difference. However, we don't have enough information to do this.

Question:Let A and B be independent events with P (A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B)?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.2 (B) 0.4 (C) 0.6 (D) 1.2 (E) 1.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, independent events, P(A), P(B), P(A/B).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the conditional probability P(A|B) given that A and B are independent events?2. What is the formula for calculating the probability of an event A occurring given that event B has already occurred, if A and B are independent?3. Who or what determines that P(A/B) can be found using the relationship between independent events?4. In what context would you apply the probabilities P(A) and P(B) when finding P(A|B) for independent events?5. When working with independent events like A and B, why is the probability of both events happening together equal to the product of their individual probabilities?6. How do you compute P(A|B) when given P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8, knowing that they are independent?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In probability theory, when dealing with the conditional probability of an event A occurring given that another event B has occurred, the appropriate operation to use is Bayes' theorem. However, for independent events A and B, a simpler approach applies. The formula for calculating P(A|B) when A and B are independent is based on the fact that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. The conditional probability P(A|B) can be found using the following formula:\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]Here, P(A ∩ B) represents the probability of both events happening together, which, for independent events, is equal to the product of their individual probabilities:\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]Since A and B are independent, we know that:\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(B)} \]\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]Now, let's consider the specific case where P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. For independent events, we directly substitute these values into the simplified formula:\[ P(A|B) = 0.2 \]So, when given the probabilities of two independent events, the conditional probability P(A|B) can be computed by multiplying their individual probabilities without any further calculations, as the dependency between them is null. This concept is useful in various contexts, such as statistics, gambling, or decision-making scenarios where the likelihood of one event does not influence the likelihood of another.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 0.6 (C) 0.7 (D) 0.8 (E) 0.9
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:events A and B, independent, probability that event A occurs, 0.6, probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs, 0.96, probability that event B occurs.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the probability of event B occurring given that A and B are independent?2. What is the relationship between the probabilities of A and B when they are independent?3. Who or what determines the probability of at least one of A or B happening?4. In which context does the independence of events A and B play a role in calculating the probability of B?5. When calculating the probability of B, what information about A's occurrence is already known?6. How can we use the given probabilities (0.6 and 0.96) to find the probability of B occurring?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:When dealing with probabilities, the concept of independence is crucial for understanding certain calculations. Given two events, A and B, if they are independent, this means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring. To find the probability of event B happening specifically when A has occurred and they are independent, we use the multiplication rule of probability. The formula for this is P(B|A) = P(B), where P(B|A) represents the conditional probability of B given A, and P(B) is the probability of B alone.The relationship between the probabilities of A and B when they are independent is that their joint probability, P(A ∩ B), equals the product of their individual probabilities, P(A) * P(B). This is expressed as P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) / P(A).The probability of at least one of A or B happening, denoted as P(A ∪ B), is determined by adding the probabilities of A and B, minus their intersection (since they cannot both happen at the same time): P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).Independence of events A and B plays a role in calculating the probability of B in situations where we want to know the likelihood of B occurring without considering the occurrence of A. If A and B are independent, we can directly use P(B) to find the probability of B.In the context of calculating the probability of B, if we know that A and B are independent, and we have the probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can simply use P(B) to find the probability of B without needing any additional information about A's occurrence.To find the probability of B using the given probabilities of 0.6 for A and 0.96 for B, since they are independent, we can directly apply P(B) = 0.96, as the occurrence of A does not affect B's probability. Therefore, the probability of B occurring is 0.96.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two numbers, relatively prime, integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive, set S, probability.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What does it mean for two numbers to be relatively prime?2. What is the relationship between the number of integers in set S and the possible pairs of relatively prime numbers?3. How many pairs of relatively prime numbers exist within set S?4. What operation can be used to determine the probability of selecting a relatively prime number from set S?5. How can we calculate the probability that a randomly selected integer from set S is relatively prime to 1,000?

We refer to Wikipedia articles on number theory for help.

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

1. Two numbers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. 

2. There are 1,000 integers in set S.

3. There are 1000 choose 2 ways to select two integers from the set. 

4. The probability of selecting a relatively prime number from set S can be calculated using the formula: P(ratio) = n(ratio) / N, where n(ratio) is the number of ways to select two integers with ratio ratio and N is the total number of ways to select two integers from set S. 

5. Let's calculate the probability:

n(1) = 1 way (for example, selecting 1 and 1000)

n(2) = 999 ways (for example, selecting 2 and 1000)

n(3) = 998 ways (for example, selecting 3 and 1000)

...

n(999) = 1 way (for example, selecting 999 and 1)

n(1000) = 1 way (for example, selecting 1000 and 1000)

N = 1000 choose 2 = 495000 ways to select two integers from set S.

Therefore, P(ratio = 1) = 1 / 495000 = 2/72500.

Since the probability of selecting a relatively prime number from set S depends on the ratio of the two integers, the most relevant choice here is (E) 2/7.

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Question:The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers, divided by 10, perfect square.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation is required to find the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers? 2. How can we determine if the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers divided by 10 forms a perfect square? 3. What type of mathematics concepts are involved in this problem? 4. Who would typically solve this type of problem? 5. When would someone encounter this problem in real-life situations? 6. What are some examples of how this information can be useful?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
The sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers can be found by simply adding them together. For example, the first odd number is 11, the second is 13, the third is 15, the fourth is 17, and the fifth is 19. Adding them up gives us 50, which is divisible by 10.
To determine if the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers divided by 10 forms a perfect square, we can check whether the resulting quotient is an integer or a decimal.
The sum of five consecutive odd numbers is divisible by 10, so when we divide it by 10, we will get a whole number. Hence, the resulting quotient must also be a whole number.
Since the sum of five consecutive odd numbers is a multiple of 10, we can rewrite it as 10n, where n is any positive integer. We can then express the sum of the five odd numbers as follows:
11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 50 = 10n

We need to find a value of n that makes the above expression a perfect square. Let's try to factorize 10n:

10n = x^2
n = x^2 / 10

Substituting n = x^2 / 10 into the expression for the sum of the five odd numbers, we get:

50 = 10(x^2 / 10)
50 = x^2

Thus, x = 5, and n = 25.

Now, let's substitute x = 5 into the expression for the sum of the five odd numbers:

11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 50 = 10(5)^2

Hence, the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 forms a perfect square. Therefore, the answer choice is (E) 44.

 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 60 (C) 70 (D) 80 (E) 90
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Present age of Ajay, years subtracted, divided by 18, present age of Rahul, years younger than Denis, Denis's age, 5 years.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation is performed when 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age?2. What operation results in the remainder when Ajay's present age is divided by 18?3. What is the age of Rahul?4. How many years younger is Rahul than Denis?5. What is the age of Denis?6. How can we use the given information to find Ajay's present age?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage: The given information states that 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, resulting in a remainder when dividing by 18. Then, we know that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old. Let's denote Ajay's present age as A and Denis's age as D.1. Subtracting 6 from Ajay's present age results in:   \( A - 6 \)2. Dividing Ajay's present age by 18 produces a remainder:   \( A - 6 \div 18 \)3. Knowing that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, we can say that Denis's age is 5 + 2 = 7 years old.4. Therefore, we can express the relationship between Ajay and Rahul's ages as:   \( A - 6 = D - 7 \)5. We can solve this equation for D:   \( D = A - 6 + 7 \)6. Substituting this expression for D into the previous equation, we get:   \( A - 6 = A - 6 + 7 - 2 \)   Solving for A, we get:   \( A = 9 \)
So, Ajay's present age is 9 years old.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Input:
Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 160 (C) 150 (D) 210 (E) 220
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: number, subtracted, 2/3, result, sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to obtain the result of 2/3 of a number minus 10?2. What is the meaning of "sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number"?3. How does the number 10 relate to the result of 2/3 of a number?4. How does the result of 2/3 of a number minus 10 differ from the given sum?5. How can we find the original number based on the result and the given sum?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:We want to find the original number that results in the sum of 40 and 1/3 of itself after being decreased by 10. The result of 2/3 of a number is obtained by dividing the number by 3 and multiplying by 2. Therefore, the result after subtracting 10 is: \begin{aligned} &\frac{2}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} - 10 \\ &= \frac{2}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} - \frac{30}{3} \\ &= \frac{2}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} - 10 \end{aligned}Now, we want to find the original number that satisfies the condition that the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the original number: \begin{aligned} &\frac{2}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} \\ &\frac{2}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} - 10 = \frac{3}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} + \frac{10}{3} \\ &\frac{2}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} - \frac{10}{3} = \text{Original Number} \\ &\frac{1}{3} \cdot \text{Original Number} = 10 \\ &\text{Original Number} = 30 \end{aligned}
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Input:
Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In how many ways can the letters of the word "PROBLEC" be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2! (B) 3! (C) 7! (D) 8! (E) 9!
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the letters of the word "PROBLEC", rearranged, 7 letter words, none of the letters repeat.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of arrangements possible when all the letters of a word are considered without repetition?2. What is the factorial notation used to calculate the number of permutations when arranging a set of distinct elements, like the letters in "PROBLEC"?3. In the context of the word "PROBLEC," how many unique letters does it have that can be rearranged to form 7-letter words?4. How does the concept of factorial apply to determining the number of ways the letters in "PROBLEC" can be arranged to create 7-letter words with no repeats?5. Who would typically perform this calculation, a mathematician, a computer programmer, or someone solving a puzzle?6. Where might you encounter this type of problem, in combinatorics, probability, or a word game like Scrabble?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the realm of combinatorics, the operation that represents the total number of arrangements possible when all the letters of a word are considered without repetition is known as permutations. This is calculated using the factorial notation, which is denoted by an exclamation mark (!). For instance, to find the permutations of the distinct elements in the word "PROBLEC," we would use the formula n! where n is the number of elements. In the case of "PROBLEC," there are 7 unique letters (P, R, O, B, L, E, and C), so the factorial for 7 letters, 7!, would give us the number of permutations.When arranging the letters in "PROBLEC" to form 7-letter words with no repeats, the factorial calculation comes into play. The number of permutations would be 7! because each letter can be placed in any of the 7 positions without repetition. To find the exact number, we multiply 7 by 6 by 5 by 4 by 3 by 2 by 1, which equals 5,040.This type of calculation is commonly performed by mathematicians and computer programmers who need to determine the combinations or permutations in various scenarios, such as data analysis, cryptography, or even in word games like Scrabble, where players need to know how many unique words they can make with a given set of letters. In essence, understanding factorials is crucial for tackling problems in combinatorics and probability.

Question:A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1000p (B) 1500p (C) 2000p (D) 2500p (E) 30000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:phone manufacturer, crates, pallets, each pallet, phones, 4 crates.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of phones per crate?2. How many phones does one pallet hold?3. What is the relationship between the number of pallets and the number of phones in a crate?4. How many phones are there in 4 crates if each crate has the same number of pallets?5. Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Question:John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: John, 3-letter codes, 5 vowels, 20 consonants, middle letter must be vowel, first and third letter must be different from each other and both consonants.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many different combinations can John make with the 5 vowels and 20 consonants?2. How many of those combinations meet the conditions that the middle letter must be a vowel and the first and third letter must be different from each other and both consonants?3. How many different codes can John make if he also wants the middle letter to be a vowel and the first and third letter to be different from each other and both consonants?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We can calculate the total number of combinations of letters by using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose. Since there are 5 vowels and 20 consonants, the total number of combinations is: C(25, 3) = 25! / (3!(25-3)!) = 25! / (3!22!) = 25 * 24 * 23 = 15,625Different combinations can be made with the given conditions if the middle letter is a vowel and the first and third letter are different from each other and both consonants. This can be achieved by selecting the middle letter as a vowel (5 options), and then choosing two different vowels and two different consonants for the first and third letters (5*4*2*1 = 40 options). Thus, the total number of codes meeting these conditions is: 15,625 * 40 = 625,000Different codes can be made if John wants the middle letter to be a vowel and the first and third letter to be different from each other and both consonants. By using the same approach as before, the total number of combinations becomes: 15,625 * 40 = 625,000The total number of codes that John can make with the given conditions is 625,000. However, some of these codes may not be valid because the middle letter cannot be a repeated vowel. To account for this, we subtract the number of repeated vowels from the total: 625,000 - (5*5) = 624,950Finally, we divide this number by 2 to account for the fact that the first and third letter can be different vowels but the middle letter cannot: 624,950 / 2 = 312,475Thus, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: number, greater than 36, less than 86.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation(s) can be used to find the number? 2. What are the two possible values for the number that satisfy the condition? 3. How can we express the range of the number in terms of these values? 4. How can we solve for the number using the given inequalities? 5. Which answer choice best represents the number within the specified range?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions, we can see that the inequality is "number > 36 AND number < 86". We can represent the two possible values for the number using interval notation, such as (36, 86]. Since both inequalities are present, we can use interval arithmetic to find the intersection of these intervals. Let's denote the number as "x".
Interval notation for "x > 36": x ∈ (36, ∞)
Interval notation for "x < 86": x ∈ (-∞, 86]
To find the intersection of these two intervals, we can write:
x ∈ (36, 86]

Therefore, among the given choices, the number that satisfies the condition is within the range 36 to 86. The number can be expressed as any value between 36 and 86 inclusive.
However, the options provided are not within this range. Therefore, none of the options are correct.

Therefore, the answer is E.

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:What is the units digit of 9^3-7? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 3 (C) 5 (D) 2 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 9^3, units digit.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation is being performed in the exponentiation of 9^3?2. How does the units digit of the base affect the units digit of the exponentiation?3. What is the units digit of 9 when raised to the power of 3?4. What is the units digit of 7 when raised to the power of 3?5. How do these two values interact in the calculation of 9^3-7?6. What is the units digit of the resulting value?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

The exponentiation of a number is a mathematical operation that raises a number to a specified power. For example, 9^3 means "9 multiplied by itself three times". In this case, the units digit of the base will only affect the units digit of the result when the base is a single-digit number. Since 9 is a single-digit number, the units digit of 9^3 is 9.

Now, let's look at the units digit of 7 when raised to the power of 3:
7^3 = 7 * 7 * 7 = 343

In the expression 9^3-7, we need to subtract the units digits of 7^3 from the units digit of 9^3:
9^3 - 7 = 9 * 9 * 9 - 7
= 81 * 9 - 7
= 729 - 7
= 722

Therefore, the units digit of the result of 9^3-7 is 2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A computer routine was developed to generate two numbers (x,y) the first being a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the second being less than or equal to the square root of the first. Each of the following pair satisfies the routine except

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

Question:Suppose you want to arrange your English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography and Science books on a shelf. In how many ways can you do it ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 520 (B) 720 (C) 920 (D) None (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:arrange, English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, Science books, shelf, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of arrangements in this problem?2. How many distinct books are there that need to be arranged?3. In how many ways can you arrange the first book (e.g., English)?4. Given that the second book can be any of the remaining, how many choices do you have for placing the Hindi book?5. What is the general term for the number of permutations when arranging n items without regard to order?6. Can you determine the answer without knowing the exact number of ways for each book's position? If not, why not?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of arrangements in the given problem, we can apply the concept of permutations, which is a mathematical operation used to determine the number of ways n items can be arranged. Let's denote the number of distinct books as B.1. The operation used for this calculation is permutation, represented by the formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where "!" denotes factorial, which means multiplying all positive integers up to that number.2. There are B distinct books that need to be arranged.3. For the first book, since it has no restrictions, there are B choices for its position.4. Once the first book is placed, there are (B-1) choices left for the second book, as it can be any of the remaining books.5. The general term for the number of permutations when arranging n items without regard to order is indeed P(n, n) = n!, as each item can go in any of the n positions.6. Yes, we can determine the answer without knowing the exact number of ways for each book's position because the final result will only depend on the total number of distinct books (B). We can multiply the number of choices for the first book by the number of choices for the second book, and so on, until all books are accounted for, resulting in B * (B-1) * ... * 1, which simplifies to B!.Therefore, the passage describing the calculations would be:To find the total number of arrangements, we apply the permutation formula P(B, B) = B! where B is the number of distinct books. First, there are B choices for placing the first book. Since the second book can be any of the remaining (B-1) books, we multiply these choices together: B * (B-1). This gives us the total number of distinct arrangements, which simplifies to B! arrangements when considering all books without regard to their specific order.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 18 (D) 20 (E) 30
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Bookshelf, 45 books, 30 hardcover, 20 fiction, maximum number of books, both hardcover and fiction.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the total number of books in the bookshelf? 2. How many books are hardcover? 3. How many books are fiction? 4. How many books are both hardcover and fiction? 5. What is the maximum possible number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction?

Step 3: Analyzing the new questions:

1. The total number of books in the bookshelf is 45.
2. Of these, 30 are hardcover.
3. There are 20 fiction books.
4. To find the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction, we subtract the number of non-fiction books from the total number of books and then subtract the number of hardcover books from the remaining number of books. This will give us the number of fiction books that can be hardcover.
   Total number of books - Hardcover books - Fiction books = Non-fiction books
   45 - 30 - 20 = 5

The maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 5. Therefore, the answer is option (A).

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
 Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:IPL season, Sachin, current batting average, 51, finals, scores 78 runs, batting average, 54, total number of matches played..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out Sachin's new batting average after scoring 78 runs?2. What is the formula for calculating a player's batting average if we know their initial average and the number of runs scored?3. Who is the subject of the batting average calculation in this scenario (Sachin)?4. Where does the change in batting average occur - in the IPL season or specifically during the finals?5. When does the change in batting average happen - after scoring 78 runs or at the end of the season?6. How many matches did Sachin play before the finals to have a current average of 51 runs?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of Sachin's cricketing journey, his batting average is a crucial statistic that reflects his performance. To determine his new average after scoring an impressive 78 runs, we can use the batting average formula. The formula is:\[ \text{New Average} = \frac{\text{Initial Average} \times \text{Matches Played} + \text{Runs Scored}}{\text{Matches Played} + 1} \]Let's assume Sachin had a current average of 51 runs before the additional match. If he played \( M \) matches prior to the finals, the calculation would look like this:\[ \text{Initial Average} = 51 \]\[ \text{Runs Scored} = 78 \]\[ \text{Matches Played Before Finals} = M \]After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new average \( \text{NewAvg} \) would be:\[ \text{NewAvg} = \frac{51M + 78}{M + 1} \]The specific change in batting average occurs during the finals, as it's after scoring those 78 runs. To find out how many matches \( M \) Sachin played before the finals to have a current average of 51, we would need to know the total runs scored before the finals. Unfortunately, without this information, we cannot directly calculate \( M \). However, once we have \( M \), we can plug it into the formula above to find his new average.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 25 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 21
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Sachin, twice as old as Ajay, 10 years ago, 40 years old in 10 years, Ajay's age today.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation represents the relationship between Sachin and Ajay's ages 10 years ago? 2. How old was Ajay 10 years ago? 3. How old is Sachin today? 4. How much older will Sachin be in 10 years? 5. How many years ago was Sachin twice as old as Ajay? 6. How long will it take for Sachin to reach 40 years old?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions, we can infer that:

  * Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago. This means that Sachin's current age minus 10 would be twice Ajay's current age minus 10.
  * We know that sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so in 10 years, Sachin will be 40 years old.
  * Since Ajay is half of Sachin's current age, in 10 years Ajay will be half of 40, which equals 20 years old.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E (21).

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

Question:My wall contains 8 red colour ties, 13 violet colour ties,10 blue colour ties, 5 pink colour ties, 4 green colour ties. If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: wall, 8 red color ties, 13 violet color ties, 10 blue color ties, 5 pink color ties, 4 green color ties, electricity is gone,至少需要两根相同颜色的领带.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the total number of ties on the wall?2. How many ties are required to be of the same color to meet the condition?3. Can we divide the total number of ties by 2 to determine the minimum number of ties to remove?4. Is it possible to remove more than 2 ties while still meeting the condition?5. What is the maximum number of ties that can be removed?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:We can calculate the total number of ties on the wall by adding up the number of each type of tie:8 red ties + 13 violet ties + 10 blue ties + 5 pink ties + 4 green ties = 40 tiesNow, to determine the minimum number of ties to remove, we can divide the total number of ties by 2 to satisfy the condition of having at least two ties of the same color:40 ties / 2 = 20 tiesSince there are only 40 ties in total, we can remove any combination of ties that equals 20. However, since we can't remove half of a tie, we can safely remove 2 ties from the wall to meet the condition.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
 Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:IPL season, Sachin, current batting average, 51, finals, scores 78 runs, batting average, 54, total number of matches played..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out Sachin's new batting average after scoring 78 runs?2. What is the formula for calculating a player's batting average if we know their initial average and the number of runs scored?3. Who is the subject of the batting average calculation in this scenario (Sachin)?4. Where does the change in batting average occur - in the IPL season or specifically during the finals?5. When does the change in batting average happen - after scoring 78 runs or at the end of the season?6. How many matches did Sachin play before the finals to have a current average of 51 runs?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of Sachin's cricketing journey, his batting average is a crucial statistic that reflects his performance. To determine his new average after scoring an impressive 78 runs, we can use the batting average formula. The formula is:\[ \text{New Average} = \frac{\text{Initial Average} \times \text{Matches Played} + \text{Runs Scored}}{\text{Matches Played} + 1} \]Let's assume Sachin had a current average of 51 runs before the additional match. If he played \( M \) matches prior to the finals, the calculation would look like this:\[ \text{Initial Average} = 51 \]\[ \text{Runs Scored} = 78 \]\[ \text{Matches Played Before Finals} = M \]After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new average \( \text{NewAvg} \) would be:\[ \text{NewAvg} = \frac{51M + 78}{M + 1} \]The specific change in batting average occurs during the finals, as it's after scoring those 78 runs. To find out how many matches \( M \) Sachin played before the finals to have a current average of 51, we would need to know the total runs scored before the finals. Unfortunately, without this information, we cannot directly calculate \( M \). However, once we have \( M \), we can plug it into the formula above to find his new average.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost? Answer Choices: (A) 70 (B) 30 (C) 3 (D) 7 (E) 5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Tennis team, wins, losses, percentage of losses, total matches, number of losses.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the relationship between the number of wins and losses? 2. What is the percentage of losses in terms of total matches? 3. How many matches were lost if the team lost 30% of their matches?

We know that the team won 20 matches and the total number of matches played is not given, but we can use the information about the percentage of losses to find out the number of matches lost. 

The percentage of losses can be calculated by multiplying the total number of losses by 30%:
Losses = Total Matches * 30%

Now we can substitute this expression into the equation:
Losses = Total Matches * 30% = Total Matches * 0.3

Solving for Total Matches:
Total Matches = Losses / 0.3

Since we know the number of wins, we can substitute that into the equation:
Total Matches = Wins + Losses
Total Matches = 20 + (Losses / 0.3)
Total Matches = 20 + (Losses * 0.3)

Step 3: Analyzing the new equations:

From the previous steps, we have derived the following equation:
Total Matches = 20 + (Losses * 0.3)

This equation tells us that the total number of matches played equals the number of wins plus three times the percentage of losses.

To find the number of losses, we can solve the equation for Losses:
Losses = Total Matches - Wins

Substituting the values we have obtained:
Losses = 20 + (Losses * 0.3) - 20

Multiplying both sides by 0.7 to eliminate the fraction:
Losses * 0.7 = 20

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
Losses = 20 / 0.7

Simplifying:
Losses = 28.57142857142857

However, since the number of matches must be an integer, we can round down to get the nearest whole number:
Losses = 28

Therefore, the team lost 28 matches during the season. 

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 5

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:students, school, more than 501, 20% physics, 28% math, least possible number of students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation can we perform to find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math if we know the percentages of students taking each subject?2. What: How can we combine the given percentages of students taking physics (20%) and math (28%) to find the maximum overlap without exceeding the total count of more than 501 students?3. Who: In this context, what entity is responsible for ensuring that the least possible number of students are accounted for twice (once in physics and once in math)?4. Where: The problem is set in a school, so how does this context affect the calculation of the least possible number of students?5. When: Is there a specific constraint related to the timeframe in which the school's student population could be determined? If not, why does it not matter in this case?6. Why: Why is finding the least possible number of students important in this situation? Does it relate to budgeting, class sizes, or another relevant factor?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario at a school, the mathematics department and physics department conducted a survey to determine student enrollment. To find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math, we need to perform a mathematical operation known as set intersection. By subtracting the percentage of students taking only one subject from the total, we can estimate the overlap. First, let's calculate the percentage of students taking either physics or math or both. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, we add these two percentages together (20% + 28% = 48%). However, since the total number of students cannot exceed 501, the overlap cannot account for more than this number. To avoid double-counting, we must subtract the sum of the percentages from 100% (the entire student population) and then find the intersection within the remaining 52% (100% - 48%).Now, let's assume that the overlap represents the least possible number of students taking both subjects. This implies that these students would not be counted twice in the physics and math counts. Therefore, the school administration, responsible for maintaining accurate records, is the entity ensuring this consistency.The context of the problem being set in a school affects the calculation because it provides the real-world setting where such enrollment data is typically gathered. However, there is no specific timeframe mentioned, and the calculation does not rely on a particular date, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.The importance of finding the least possible number of students taking both subjects lies in efficient resource allocation and planning. It ensures that when allocating budgets for resources like classrooms, instructors, or materials, the school does not overestimate the demand for combined courses, thereby making the allocation more precise and cost-effective.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: students, school, prom night, debating session, at least 45%, at least 35%, maximum number of students, neither attended.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation should be used to find the total number of students who attended the prom night and/or the debating session?2. How many students are attending the prom night or the debating session if at least 45% of the students attended both events?3. What is the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event?4. What operation should be used to find the total number of students who attended neither event if we know the percentage of students who attended the prom night and/or the debating session?5. Where is this calculation taking place, and what entities are responsible for enforcing the attendance requirements?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:To find the total number of students who attended the prom night and/or the debating session, we would use the addition operation. Let's say the total number of students who attended both events is denoted as Y. The formula would be:Y = At prom night + Debating sessionY = X * 45% + Y * 35%Y = 0.45X + 0.35XY = 0.8XWhere X is the total number of students. If we want to find the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event, we subtract the total number of students who attended both events from the total number of students. This means the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event is equal to the total number of students minus the total number of students who attended both events. We can express this as follows:Max number of students who could have neither attended = Total students - (At prom night + Debating session)Max number of students who could have neither attended = Total students - 0.8X
Since the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event depends on the total number of students, the problem is set in a school. However, the calculation does not rely on a specific timeframe, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Coin diver,铜币, 求解最少的铜币数量, 材料价格, 分数单位。
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much does a coin diver get for each copper coin?2. How much does a coin diver get for each brass coin?3. How much did the coin diver earn after one dive?4. What is the total cost of all the copper coins?5. What is the total cost of all the brass coins?6. Is there a way to minimize the number of copper coins by combining them with other types of coins?7. What is the minimum number of copper coins that the coin diver must bring?
Step 3: Analyze the new questions:Based on the information provided, the coin diver earns 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. This means she found at least one brass coin and possibly some copper coins. We can set up two equations to solve for the number of copper and brass coins:

铜币数量 = x, 铜币价值 = 20x (假设每枚铜币价值为20美分)
硬币数量 = y, 硬币价值 = 25y (假设每枚硬币价值为25美分)

她总共有$3.40，因此我们可以将上述两个方程联立起来：

20x + 25y = 340

通过消元法，我们得到：

x + 5y = 34

接下来我们需要找到最小的整数解。由于x和y都是正整数，我们可以尝试分别取x=1和y=6来满足这个方程：

1 + 5*6 = 34

所以，最少需要带1枚铜币。

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bee, flowers, bypasses, 0.05%, nectar, 8 flowers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should we use to find out how many flowers the bee would typically fly by without bypassing any?2. What percentage of flowers does the bee actually inspect when it bypasses 8 flowers?3. How many flowers does the bee inspect before it bypasses one flower?4. Given the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, what fraction of the flowers it encounters represents those it bypasses?5. In order to find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, what formula can we apply using the given bypass rate?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option represents the total number of flowers the bee would inspect if it bypasses 8 flowers based on the given bypass rate?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the bee's flower inspection process, let's denote the total number of flowers as \( F \). According to the problem, the bee bypasses a certain percentage of flowers, which is given as 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \) (as a decimal). 1. To find out how many flowers the bee would typically inspect without bypassing any, we simply divide the total number of flowers by 1, so \( F \) flowers.2. When the bee bypasses 8 flowers, the percentage inspected is \( 100\% - 0.05\% \), which simplifies to \( 99.95\% \) of the flowers. To find the fraction, we divide this percentage by 100: \( \frac{99.95}{100} \).3. To find out how many flowers the bee inspects before bypassing one, we need to invert the bypass rate. Since the bee bypasses 0.05%, it inspects \( 100\% - 0.05\% = 99.95\% \) for each flower. Therefore, we can express this as \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \).4. The fraction of flowers bypassed is the bypass rate, which is 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \).5. To find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, we can set up the equation \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \). Solving for \( F \), we rearrange the terms and multiply both sides by 0.9995 to isolate \( F \).6. Once we solve the equation from step 5, we will get the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, denoted as \( T \).After performing the calculations, we find that:- The bee would inspect \( F \) flowers without bypassing.- It inspects \( \frac{99.95}{100} \) or approximately 99.95% of flowers per flower.- Before bypassing one flower, it inspects \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \) flowers.- The fraction of bypassed flowers is \( 0.0005 \).- The total number of flowers inspected before bypassing 8 is determined by solving \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \).The specific numerical values for the total number of flowers before bypassing 8 cannot be determined without knowing the total number of flowers (\( F \)) in the first place. However, the passage provides the steps needed to calculate it given \( F \).

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 12 (E) 14
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Jill, party, 10 bottles of soda, 8 people, 12 people.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How many bottles of soda did Jill initially buy for the party? 2. What is the relationship between the number of attendees at the initial party and the number of bottles of soda bought? 3. How does the number of attendees change in the second party? 4. How many additional bottles of soda will Jill need to buy for the second party? 5. Are the original bottles enough for the second party? 6. What is the final number of bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for the second party?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions, we can infer that: Jill initially bought 10 bottles of soda for an 8-person party. To determine how many additional bottles she needs for the 12-person party, we subtract the number of bottles she initially bought from the total number of attendees. Since she initially bought 10 bottles, she would need an additional 12 - 8 = 4 bottles for the 12-person party.Jill initially bought 10 bottles of soda for the party. The relationship between the number of attendees at the initial party and the number of bottles of soda bought is that the number of bottles bought is proportional to the number of attendees. If the number of attendees increases by 4, she will need an additional 4 bottles of soda. So, Jill will need 10 + 4 = 14 bottles of soda for the 12-person party. These additional bottles will be enough to accommodate the extra guests at the party.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
We can use proportions to solve this problem. Let's denote the weight of corn as "c" pounds, and since the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5, we can write:

2(corn) + 3(wheat) + 5(rice) = 3(rice)

Substituting 3 pounds of rice into the equation:

2c + 3(3) + 5(3) = 3(3)

Simplifying:

2c + 9 + 15 = 9

Combining like terms:

2c = 0

This result doesn't make sense because the weight of corn cannot be zero. Therefore, there is no solution for c. 

However, we can also note that the given ratio states that the total weight of the mixture is twice the weight of rice. So, we can write:

Total weight = 2(rice)

Substituting 3 pounds of rice:

Total weight = 2(3)

Total weight = 6 pounds

Since we don't have enough information to uniquely determine the weight of corn, the answer is E: None of the above.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 80 (C) 95 (D) 100 (E) 85
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: ratio of red sweets to green sweets, 3:4, bag of red and green sweets, 120 green sweets.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to calculate the total number of red sweets?2. What is the relationship between the number of red sweets and the number of green sweets in the bag?3. How many red sweets are in the bag if the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4?4. What is the relationship between the number of red sweets and the total number of sweets in the bag?5. Is the total number of red sweets constant across different bags of red and green sweets?6. When was the bag of red and green sweets purchased?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

The ratio of red sweets to green sweets in the bag is 3:4, meaning for every 4 green sweets, there are 3 red sweets. Therefore, the total number of red sweets in the bag is 3 times the number of green sweets.

Now, we can solve for the number of red sweets:
Total number of red sweets = 3 * Number of green sweets
Substituting the given value for green sweets:
Total number of red sweets = 3 * 120
Total number of red sweets = 360

Therefore, the answer is A. There are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Question:The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:number of water lilies, doubles every two days, one water lily, 60 days, lake fully covered, initially, 64 water lilies..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the doubling of water lilies represent in terms of exponential growth?2. How many times does the number of water lilies double during the 60 days when starting with one lily?3. What is the initial condition that needs to be considered for the 64 water lilies?4. In how many days would the lake be half-covered if there were initially 64 water lilies?5. Given the doubling pattern, how many days would it take for 64 water lilies to double to the point of covering half the lake?6. How many doublings are needed for 64 water lilies to cover the entire lake, considering the lake started with one lily?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The doubling of water lilies represents an exponential growth process, where the number of plants increases at a constant rate. To calculate the number of times the lilies double during 60 days, we can use the formula for exponential growth: \( N = N_0 \times 2^{t/d} \), where \( N \) is the final number, \( N_0 \) is the initial number (one lily), \( t \) is the time (in days), and \( d \) is the doubling period.For the first question, since the lake doubles every day, \( d = 1 \) day. So after 60 days, \( N = 1 \times 2^{60/1} = 1 \times 2^{60} \). This indicates that the lilies double 60 times over 60 days.Now, for the second question, since the initial condition was one lily, the lake would be half-covered if there are 64 lilies. To find out how many doublings this represents, we can use the formula again with \( N_0 = 1 \) and \( N = 64 \): \( 64 = 1 \times 2^x \), solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \log_2(64) = 6 \) doublings. For the third question, if there are initially 64 water lilies, we need to determine how many days it takes for them to cover half the lake. Since each doubling covers half the remaining area, we don't need to calculate the exact number of days but can infer that it would be half the number of doublings required for 64 to double to 128 (covering the whole lake). So, it would take 3 doublings (since \( 2^3 = 8 \), and 8 is half of 16).Finally, to find out how many days it takes for 64 lilies to double to cover half the lake, we use the same logic as before: since each doubling halves the remaining area, it would take half the number of doublings to go from 64 to 32, which is \( \log_2(32) = 5 \) days.To cover the entire lake, we've established that 6 doublings are needed, so if we start with one lily, it would take \( 6 \times 1 \) day, which is 6 days.In summary, the doubling of water lilies represents an exponential growth process. Over 60 days, they double 60 times when starting with one lily. For 64 lilies to cover half the lake, it would take 3 doublings, which is approximately 5 days. To cover the entire lake, 64 lilies require 6 doublings, taking 6 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Shweta, rides, rate of 10 km per hour, stops, 10 minutes rest, every 15 km, cover, 100 km..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Shweta perform when calculating her total travel time?2. What is the distance she covers without stopping each time?3. How many times does she need to stop for a rest during the 100 km journey?4. How long does each rest period last in terms of hours?5. In how many intervals of 15 km does she ride before taking a break?6. How can we combine her riding time and resting time to find the total time taken to cover 100 km?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Shweta's strategy for her 100 km journey involves a unique pattern of riding and resting. She maintains a steady pace without stopping for the first part of the trip. To calculate her total travel time, Shweta performs simple arithmetic by dividing the total distance by her continuous riding speed. Let's assume she rides at a constant speed of 20 km/h.1. When calculating her total travel time, Shweta uses the formula: Time (hours) = Distance (km) / Speed (km/h). Since she rides without stopping initially, we only consider this part of the calculation.2. The distance she covers without stopping each time is 100 km, as she is riding continuously until she reaches the first rest point.3. To find out how many times she needs to stop for a rest, we divide the total distance by the distance she rides before needing a break. Assuming she takes a break after every 15 km, we calculate: Breaks = Total Distance / Interval Distance = 100 km / 15 km = 6.67, which rounds up to 7 breaks because she cannot take a fraction of a break.4. Each rest period lasts the same duration. If she takes a break after completing one interval, the rest time would be the time it takes to ride 15 km at her speed. Rest Time (hours) = Interval Distance (km) / Speed (km/h) = 15 km / 20 km/h = 0.75 hours.5. Since she rides 15 km before taking a break, we can say that she rides in 6 intervals (as calculated above) before stopping for the first time, and then again after each subsequent interval.6. To combine her riding time and resting time, we sum up the time for each interval. There are 7 intervals, including the initial one where she rides continuously. For the first interval, there's no rest, so the time is just the distance divided by speed. For the other intervals, we add the riding time and the rest time. So, Total Time (hours) = (100 km - (15 km * 6)) / 20 km/h + (0.75 hours * 6).In summary, Shweta rides at a speed of 20 km/h, covering 100 km in 5 hours (100 km / 20 km/h), taking 7 breaks, each lasting 0.75 hours. After accounting for the rest periods, her total time to cover 100 km is approximately 5.25 hours (100 km / 20 km/h + (0.75 * 6)).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, rows, rate, 4 kmph, still water, rate against the current, 2 kmph, rate along the current.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the man's speed in still water if he rows at 4 kmph?2. What is the formula to calculate the speed of an object moving against the current, given the man's rowing speed and his speed against the current?3. Who is the subject of the problem, and what is their action that affects the calculation of the rate along the current?4. In what situation does the man's rate against the current play a role in determining his rate along the current?5. When would you need to consider both the man's speed in still water and his speed against the current to find the rate along the current?6. How can you combine the given rates (4 kmph and 2 kmph) to determine the man's speed along the current?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The problem revolves around a man who is rowing a boat. To find his speed in still water, we can use the basic formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. However, since the question doesn't provide specific distances, we'll assume that his rowing speed of 4 kmph represents his constant speed in calm waters without any external factors.To calculate the man's speed when rowing against the current, we need to consider the combined effect of his rowing effort and the river's flow. The formula for this is:Speed against the current = Rowing speed - Speed of the currentHowever, the speed of the current is not given in the problem. Let's denote it as 'C' kmph. If the man rows at 4 kmph and his speed against the current is 2 kmph, we can deduce that:2 kmph = 4 kmph - CSolving for C, we get:C = 4 kmph - 2 kmphC = 2 kmphNow, to find the man's speed along the current, we use the same formula but with the speed of the current added to his rowing speed:Speed along the current = Rowing speed + Speed of the currentSpeed along the current = 4 kmph + 2 kmphSpeed along the current = 6 kmphIn this case, the man's rate against the current (2 kmph) plays a role when determining his rate along the current because it accounts for the resistance caused by the flow of the water. When the man's speed in still water (4 kmph) and his speed against the current are both known, as they are here, you can directly combine them to find the rate along the current without needing additional context or conditions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: well, depth, frog, 30m, jumps, 3m up, falls, 2m down, comes out of the well.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the change in the frog's position when he jumps 3m up and falls 2m down each day?2. Is the frog's progress towards the surface affected by the change in his height each day?3. How many meters higher than the bottom of the well will the frog be after each jump?4. How many meters lower than the top of the well will the frog be after each fall?5. How many meters above the bottom of the well will the frog be after the 25th day of jumping and falling?6. Can the frog reach the top of the well after 25 days of jumping and falling?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage: We know that the frog starts at the bottom of the well with a depth of 30m. His progress depends on the daily changes in his height, which are 3m up and 2m down. The question asks how many days it will take for him to come out of the well, which means he needs to reach the top of the well, or 30m above the bottom of the well.

Since the frog is rising 3m each day and falling 2m each day, the net gain each day is 1m. Therefore, to reach the top of the well after 25 days, the frog would have gained a total of 25 meters. This means he would have reached a height of 30m + 25m = 55m above the bottom of the well after 25 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars?
 Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Car 'X', distance 320 kms, 8 hours, Car 'Y', distance 415 kms, 5 hours, speed difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which car has a higher speed: Car 'X' or Car 'Y'?2. How far does Car 'X' travel per hour?3. What is the speed of Car 'X' in kilometers per hour?4. How far does Car 'Y' travel per hour?5. What is the speed of Car 'Y' in kilometers per hour?6. To find the speed difference, how many kilometers per hour does Car 'Y' travel more than Car 'X'?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After analyzing the given data, we can determine the speeds and distances traveled by both cars, Car 'X' and Car 'Y'. Unfortunately, no specific numerical values were provided for the speeds or distances. However, we can assume that if you have the necessary information, such as their respective speeds in miles per hour (mph) or meters per second (m/s), we can convert them into kilometers per hour (km/h) using the following conversions:1 mph = 1.60934 km/h1 m/s = 3.6 km/hTo compare the speeds, let's denote the speed of Car 'X' as \( V_X \) (in km/h) and the speed of Car 'Y' as \( V_Y \) (also in km/h). If \( V_X > V_Y \), then Car 'X' has a higher speed.For the distances traveled per hour, we would need the time traveled for each car to calculate the distance covered. Assuming they travel at constant speeds, the distance \( D_X \) for Car 'X' in one hour is \( V_X \) multiplied by the time, and similarly for Car 'Y', the distance \( D_Y \) is \( V_Y \) times the time.The speed difference between Car 'Y' and Car 'X' is calculated as \( |V_Y - V_X| \) (absolute value since we are only interested in the magnitude).Without the actual speeds, we cannot provide specific numbers for these calculations. However, if you provide the speeds or any other relevant data, we can easily perform the calculations and construct the passage accordingly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Allen, X, Y, Bob, Y, change direction, 54 kmph, 78 kmph, 48 km more.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the total distance Allen travels in the entire journey?2. What is the total distance Bob travels in the entire journey?3. How many times do they meet each other throughout the journey?4. What is the distance between their first meeting point and the second meeting point?5. What is the relationship between the speeds of Allen and Bob during their first and second meetings?6. What is the distance between their first meeting point and their second meeting point if Allen and Bob maintain their respective speeds?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:In this scenario, we can break down the journey into two parts: Allen going from X to Y and Bob going from Y to X. Allen travels from X to Y at a speed of 54 kmph and then changes direction and returns to X, while Bob travels from Y to X at a speed of 78 kmph and then changes direction and returns to Y. Let's denote the distance between X and Y as d. During the first part of the journey, Allen covers d km in 1 hour, as his speed is 54 kmph. Similarly, Bob covers d km in 1 hour with a speed of 78 kmph.Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time, meaning he has gone 48 km more than Allen in the first leg of the journey. So, when Bob meets Allen at their second meeting point, Allen must have traveled 48 km + d km = 54 kmph * t km (where t is the time they met for the first time). Solving this equation, we get t = 2 hours.Bob also covers 48 km more than Allen in the second leg of the journey, meaning he has gone 48 km more than Allen in the second leg of the journey. So, when Bob meets Allen at their second meeting point, Allen must have traveled 54 kmph * 2 hours = 108 km.In conclusion, the total distance Allen travels is 54 km + 108 km = 162 km, and the total distance Bob travels is 78 km + 108 km = 186 km. The distance between their first meeting point and the second meeting point is 186 km - 162 km = 24 km.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx)
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Liquid, drain, rate, w/25 gallons every x seconds, y gallons, minutes.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the liquid passing through the drain and the rate of flow?2. What is the formula for the time required for a given amount of liquid to pass through the drain?3. How much liquid is present in the drain initially?4. What is the relationship between the initial amount of liquid and the rate of flow?5. How many gallons will pass through the drain during a given time period?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We can determine the relationship between the liquid passing through the drain and the rate of flow using the formula: Time = Quantity/Rate. In this case, the quantity of liquid passing through the drain per unit time is represented by w/25 gallons per x seconds. Therefore, the time required for y gallons to pass through the drain can be calculated as follows:
Time = y gallons / (w/25 gallons/x seconds) = (25y/x) minutes
Therefore, among the choices, option (A) y/(1200xy) is incorrect because it does not represent the correct time taken to pass through the drain. Option (B) 20xy/w is also incorrect because it does not correctly relate the liquid passing through the drain to the rate of flow. Option (C) 5xy/(12w) is incorrect because it does not correctly represent the relationship between the initial amount of liquid and the rate of flow. Option (D) w/(3xy) is incorrect because it does not correctly represent the relationship between the rate of flow and the time taken to pass through the drain. Option (E) 3y/(wx) correctly represents the relationship between the liquid passing through the drain and the time taken, as well as the relationship between the initial amount of liquid and the rate of flow.

Therefore, the answer is (E).

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Jeep, distance, forward journey, 6 hours, increase in speed, return journey, 12 km/hr, 4 hours, distance.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation can be used to calculate the distance covered in the forward journey? 2. What is the formula to calculate the time taken to travel a certain distance at a given speed? 3. Who is the subject performing the action in both journeys? 4. When was the speed increased? 5. How does the change in speed affect the time taken? 6. Is the return journey considered as separate from the forward journey or combined with it?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

- To calculate the distance covered in the forward journey, we can use the formula: distance = speed × time. Since the speed remained constant, we can write:
distance = speed × time Forward Journey = speed × 6 hours
- The time taken to travel the distance in the return journey depends on the increased speed of 12 km/hr. If the increased speed is added to the original speed, the time taken would be reduced by half. Therefore, the time taken for the return journey is:
time Return Journey = time Forward Journey / 2 = speed Forward Journey × 6 hours / 2 = speed Forward Journey × 3 hours
- The subject performing the action in both journeys is the jeep.
- The speed increase occurred during the return journey, which affects the time taken.

Therefore, the total distance covered by the jeep is the sum of the distances covered in the forward and return journeys:

Total Distance = Distance Forward Journey + Distance Return Journey = speed Forward Journey × 6 hours + speed Forward Journey × 3 hours

To find the distance, we can substitute the values for the speed:

Total Distance = 12 km/hr × 6 hours + 12 km/hr × 3 hours
Total Distance = 72 km + 36 km
Total Distance = 108 km

So the distance traveled by the jeep is 108 km.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.
 Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, eat, fruit (breakfast), vegetable (dinner), 6 different types of fruit, 8 different types of vegetables, eat one type at a time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of combinations when selecting one type of fruit for breakfast?2. How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two balls A and B, circular track, 2 full rotations, 26 minutes, 5 full rotations, 35 minutes, start point, same starting point again.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation represents the rate at which ball A rotates?2. How many rotations has ball A made in 26 minutes?3. What is the ratio of the rotations of ball A to those of ball B?4. How many rotations has ball B made in 35 minutes?5. How many rotations will ball A make in 35 minutes?6. How many rotations will ball B make in 26 minutes?7. When will ball A and ball B be at the same starting point again? We can solve this by finding the difference between the number of rotations of ball A and ball B in a single rotation and the difference in the time it takes them to make those rotations.
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Ball A's rate of rotation can be represented by the number of rotations per minute, denoted as \( R_A \). Since ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, we can find its rate by dividing the number of rotations by the time taken:\[ R_A = \frac{2 \text{ rotations}}{26 \text{ minutes}} \]Similarly, ball B's rate of rotation can be represented by the number of rotations per minute, denoted as \( R_B \). Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so:\[ R_B = \frac{5 \text{ rotations}}{35 \text{ minutes}} \]Now, let's find the ratio of the rotations of ball A to those of ball B: \[ \frac{R_A}{R_B} = \frac{2}{5} \]If ball A makes n rotations in 35 minutes, it will make (n/5) rotations in 26 minutes. Therefore,\[ \frac{n}{5} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{35}{26} \implies n = 2 \text{ rotations} \]In conclusion, ball A will make 2 rotations in 26 minutes, and ball B will make 5 rotations in 35 minutes. To find the time when they will be at the same starting point again, we subtract the number of rotations of ball B from the number of rotations of ball A: \[ Time = 26 \text{ minutes} - 35 \text{ minutes} \]Solving for Time gives us: \[ Time = -9 \text{ minutes} \]
This result indicates that the two balls will never be at the same starting point again since the time is negative. However, the question asks for the time when they will be at the same starting point again, which is not possible under the given conditions. 

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
 Answer Choices: (A) M + N / 8 (B) 2M + N / 8 (C) M + N / 4 (D) M + 3N / 8 (E) M + N / 5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:athlete, M miles, 4 hours, rides, bike, N miles, average speed, miles per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation combines the distances M miles and N miles to find the total distance traveled for both activities?2. How should the time taken (4 hours) be incorporated when calculating the average speed?3. What type of average speed is being asked for - arithmetic mean or another form?4. Who or what is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the athlete running and biking or just the combined activities?5. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the combined activities' performance?6. How are the values M and N related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different modes of transportation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When combining the distances covered during two separate activities, one can use the addition operation to find the total distance traveled. For instance, if an athlete runs M miles and then cycles N miles, the combined distance, denoted as D_total, would be calculated as follows:D_total = M miles + N milesTo incorporate the time taken for both activities, let's say it's 4 hours, we need to calculate the average speed, which represents the overall efficiency in terms of distance covered per unit time. The average speed (V_avg) is found by dividing the total distance by the total time spent on the activities:V_avg = D_total / Time (in hours)In this case, the average speed is an arithmetic mean, as it's a simple average of the speeds achieved during each mode of transportation without considering any variations or weights.The subject of the "average speed" calculation is the athlete, as it reflects their combined performance in running and biking. This average speed gives an indication of their overall pace for the day, regardless of whether they were faster on one activity or the other.The context in which this average speed is relevant is when assessing the athlete's endurance or comparing their performance across different days. By calculating V_avg, we can gauge how efficiently they utilized their time and energy during the combined running and biking session.The values M and N are directly related to the average speed formula, as they contribute to the numerator (total distance), while the time taken (4 hours) serves as the denominator, ultimately determining the rate at which the athlete covered the combined distance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is Answer Choices: (A) 4 1/3 km/h (B) 7 2/3 km/h (C) 9 ½ km/h (D) 8 km/h (E) 81 km/h
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: man, walks, 5 kmph, 6 hours, 4 kmph, 12 hours, average speed.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. Which operation can be used to calculate the total distance covered by the man? 2. What is the formula to calculate the average speed when given the total distance and time? 3. Who is the subject performing the action of walking? 4. How many hours did the man walk at 5 kmph and at 4 kmph? 5. In which context would you need to calculate the average speed of a man who walks at different speeds for different periods of time? 6. What units of measurement should be used for the total distance and time?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

The man walked for two different periods of time at different speeds: 6 hours at 5 kmph and 12 hours at 4 kmph. We can use the sum of the distances covered at each speed to find the total distance, and then divide by the total time to get the average speed. Let's denote the total distance as D_total and the total time as T_total. The formula for the average speed is:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time

We need to solve for D_total and T_total:

D_total = Distance covered at 5 kmph * Time spent at 5 kmph + Distance covered at 4 kmph * Time spent at 4 kmph
Substituting the given values:
D_total = 5 kmph * 6 hours + 4 kmph * 12 hours
D_total = 30 km + 48 km
D_total = 78 km

Now we can substitute this value back into the average speed formula:
Average speed = 78 km / T_total

However, we do not have T_total explicitly provided in the question. Without additional information, we cannot determine the average speed accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is unknown.

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two ants, farms, distance, ants A and B, speeds, 9 cm/hour and 6 cm/hour.

What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled by an object at a certain speed over a period of time? 3. Who are the subjects in this scenario? 4. Where do the ants start and finish their journey? 5. How long does it take for ant A to reach the destination? 6. What is the distance between the ants' farms? 
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: Ants A and B are moving towards each other, and we are asked to find the distance that ant A has traveled until they meet. To find this, we can use the formula for distance traveled by an object at a certain speed over a period of time: \[ d = speed \times time \] where speed is in cm/hour and time is in hours. Since we know the speeds of both ants and the distance between their farms, we can calculate the time it takes for ant A to reach the destination: \[ time = \frac{distance}{speed_A} \] The distance between the ants' farms is given as 75 cm, and the speed of ant A is 9 cm/hour. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: \[ time = \frac{75}{9} \] Now we can calculate the distance that ant A has traveled until meeting ant B: \[ distance_A = speed_A \times time \] \[ distance_A = 9 \times \frac{75}{9} \] \[ distance_A = 75 \text{ cm} \]

If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sharon, 5 hours, Karen, 4 hours, buy the cake together..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long Sharon and Karen work together before they can afford the cake?2. How many total hours of work do Sharon and Karen have combined?3. Who works longer initially, Sharon or Karen, and by how many hours?4. In what situation does the combined work hours of Sharon and Karen equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone?5. When they work together, after how many hours will their combined earnings equal the cost of the cake?6. What is the mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together based on their individual work hours?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Sharon and Karen are saving up to buy a cake that costs $24. Each hour, Sharon earns $8, while Karen earns $6 per hour. To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Three bells, intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds, ringing together at a particular time, next time they ring together.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the common interval between the three bell-ringing patterns?2. How many seconds pass between the first two rings of the pattern?3. How many seconds pass between the second and third rings of the pattern?4. How many seconds pass between the first, second, and third rings of the pattern?5. What is the total time that passes between the first and the next time all three bells ring together?6. What is the time period represented by the first three rings?7. Can the first three rings be represented by any of the options provided?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

- Common interval: All three bell-ringing patterns have the same common interval of 12 seconds. This is because 36 + 40 + 48 = 120 seconds, which is divisible by 12.
- First two rings: The first two rings occur at 36 seconds apart.
- Second and third rings: The second and third rings occur at 40 seconds apart.
- First, second, and third rings: The first, second, and third rings occur at 48 seconds apart.
- Total time between first and next time all three rings together: To find the total time between the first and the next time all three bells ring together, we subtract the time between the first two rings from the time between the second and third rings: Time between first and next time all three rings together = 48 - 40 = 8 seconds.
- Time period represented by the first three rings: The time period represented by the first three rings is 36 + 40 + 48 = 124 seconds.
- The first three rings cannot be represented by any of the options provided, as they fall outside the range of the given choices.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Three friends (Alan, Roger, Peter), answer a question, exam, Alan, 1/5 probability, guessing correctly, Roger, cheating, 2/3 probability, answering correctly, Peter, 5/6 probability, correct answer, cheating not via..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the probability of a correct answer without cheating?2. What is the probability that Alan answers the question correctly?3. How can we combine Alan's and Peter's probabilities to find the total non-cheating probability?4. Who has the highest probability of answering correctly without cheating?5. In what context does the problem take place, i.e., the exam situation?6. Why is it important to consider both cheating and non-cheating probabilities when determining the overall answer?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In an exam setting, it is crucial to account for both cheating and non-cheating probabilities when assessing a student's performance. To find the probability of a correct answer without cheating, one would typically use the concept of independent events. If Alan and Peter each have their own individual chances of answering correctly, which are P(A) and P(P), respectively, without any prior information about their study habits, we assume they are independent.To calculate the probability of Alan answering correctly (P(A)) without cheating, we need to know his actual skill level or the provided probability. Let's say P(A) = 0.7, meaning there's a 70% chance he knows the answer. Similarly, if Peter's probability is P(P) = 0.6, he has a 60% chance of getting it right.To combine their probabilities for the total non-cheating probability, we multiply their individual probabilities because their actions are assumed to be independent. So, the combined probability (P(both correct)) is P(A) * P(P) = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42, or 42%.Comparing their probabilities, Alan has a slightly higher non-cheating probability than Peter. This indicates that, without any external influence, Alan is more likely to answer correctly on this particular question.In conclusion, considering both cheating and non-cheating probabilities is essential in an exam context as it provides a comprehensive understanding of students' abilities. It ensures fairness and accuracy in evaluating their knowledge without being swayed by potential dishonesty. In this case, Alan has the highest probability of answering correctly without cheating, which contributes to a more reliable assessment of their academic prowess.

Question:John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, lightly flavored tea, evening, 50% strong milk tea, milk, 15% milk replacement, resultant solution, 10% milk replacement..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What percentage of the original 50% strong milk tea does John replace with milk initially?2. How much: How much milk does John add to the 50% strong milk tea during the first replacement?3. Which: After the first replacement, what is the new concentration of milk in the mixture?4. How much: How much of the resultant solution does John replace with milk during the second replacement?5. What: What is the final concentration of milk in the tea after both replacements?6. When: At what time of day does John typically perform this milk replacement process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:John starts with a 50% strong milk tea, which means that for every 100 ml of tea, there are 50 ml of milk. Initially, he decides to dilute the tea by replacing 25% of its volume with milk. To find out how much milk he adds during the first replacement, we calculate:25% of the original amount = (25/100) * 50 ml = 12.5 mlAfter the first replacement, the new concentration of milk in the mixture is:Milk after first replacement = Initial milk + Additional milk= 50 ml + 12.5 ml= 62.5 mlThe total volume remains the same at 100 ml, so the new milk concentration as a percentage is:New concentration = (Milk after first replacement / Total volume) * 100%= (62.5 ml / 100 ml) * 100%= 62.5%For the second replacement, John replaces another 25% of the volume of the newly mixed tea. Since the tea has now been diluted, we need to consider the new volume after the first replacement:New volume after first replacement = 100 ml - (25% of 100 ml)= 100 ml - 25 ml= 75 mlNow, he adds 25% of this new volume:Milk added during second replacement = 25% of 75 ml= (25/100) * 75 ml= 18.75 mlAdding this to the milk from the first replacement:Total milk after second replacement = 62.5 ml + 18.75 ml= 81.25 mlThe final concentration of milk in the tea after both replacements is:Final concentration = (Total milk after second replacement / New volume after second replacement) * 100%= (81.25 ml / 75 ml) * 100%= 108.33%As for the time of day, the passage doesn't provide that information. However, we have calculated the concentrations and volumes involved in John's milk replacement process over two stages.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Kevin, drive, A to B, constant speed, 70 mph, turn around, pause, return, A, constant speed, 90 mph, 3 hours before the end of the trip, 70 miles away from B.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Kevin covered at his first speed (70 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of driving at different speeds (Kevin)?4. Where does Kevin start his journey (A) and where does he end it (B)?5. What happens after Kevin reaches B?6. How much time does Kevin spend driving towards B and turning around?7. What is the distance between Kevin's starting point and destination (B)?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Kevin began his journey from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. He then turned around and headed back towards A, but the speed remained constant at 90 mph. We can assume that he stopped for a short period of time (pause) after arriving at B. At this point, he was 70 miles away from B. We can use the formula for distance at a constant speed (d) to calculate the distance he covered at each speed: For the first part of the journey, we'll use \(d_1 = speed_1 \times time_1\):\[d_1 = 70 mph \times t_1\]For the second part of the journey, we'll use \(d_2 = speed_2 \times time_2\):\[d_2 = 90 mph \times t_2\]Given that the entire trip took three hours, the time spent driving towards B and turning around is \(t_{total} = t_1 + t_2\). Now, the distance between A and B is simply the sum of the distances covered during the two parts of the journey: \(d_{AB} = d_1 + d_2\)

Since we don't have any additional information about the time Kevin spent driving towards B and turning around, we cannot calculate the exact distance between A and B. However, we can state that the distance between A and B is greater than 70 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet? Answer Choices: (A)  1 (B)  1.25 (C)  1.50 (D)  1.75 (E)  2
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two cars, same starting point, opposite ends, 50 miles long, 12 mph, 13 mph, time, meet.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation can be used to find the time when two cars meet? 2. What is the formula to calculate the time when two cars travel at different speeds towards each other? 3. Who or what is the subject involved in the meeting? 4. What is the context in which the question occurs? 5. When would the cars meet if they both travel at their respective speeds? 6. What is the relationship between the speeds of the cars and the time it takes for them to meet?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions, we see that:
- We need to find the time when two cars meet. 
- The time it takes for the cars to meet can be calculated by finding the distance between them divided by their relative speed.
- Both cars start at opposite ends of a 50-mile highway and are traveling towards each other.
- The problem can occur during a road trip, race, or any situation where the two cars are traveling towards each other.
- If both cars travel at their respective speeds, the time it takes for them to meet depends on the relative speed difference between them.
Step 4: To find the time when the cars meet, we need to calculate the distance between them and divide it by their relative speed.
- Let's denote the distance between the cars as "d" and the relative speed as "v".
- The distance between the cars is 50 miles.
- The first car travels at 12 mph, so it will take it "d/v" hours to travel the distance.
- The second car travels at 13 mph, so it will take it "d/v" hours to travel the distance.
- Therefore, the total time it takes for the two cars to meet is d/v + d/v.
- Adding these two quantities together, we get 2d/v hours.
Step 5: Now we need to substitute the actual values for d and v:
- If d = 50 miles and v = 12 mph, the total time it takes for the two cars to meet is 2 * 50/12 = 12.5 hours.
- If d = 50 miles and v = 13 mph, the total time it takes for the two cars to meet is 2 * 50/13 = 15.3846153846153846 hours.
Step 6: Comparing the two results, the answer is either option B (1.25) or option C (1.50), depending on whether we round up or down. Option D (1.75) and option E (2) are not correct because they do not represent the actual time it takes for the two cars to meet.

Question:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
 Answer Choices: (A) M + N / 8 (B) 2M + N / 8 (C) M + N / 4 (D) M + 3N / 8 (E) M + N / 5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:athlete, M miles, 4 hours, rides, bike, N miles, average speed, miles per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation combines the distances M miles and N miles to find the total distance traveled for both activities?2. How should the time taken (4 hours) be incorporated when calculating the average speed?3. What type of average speed is being asked for - arithmetic mean or another form?4. Who or what is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the athlete running and biking or just the combined activities?5. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the combined activities' performance?6. How are the values M and N related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different modes of transportation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When combining the distances covered during two separate activities, one can use the addition operation to find the total distance traveled. For instance, if an athlete runs M miles and then cycles N miles, the combined distance, denoted as D_total, would be calculated as follows:D_total = M miles + N milesTo incorporate the time taken for both activities, let's say it's 4 hours, we need to calculate the average speed, which represents the overall efficiency in terms of distance covered per unit time. The average speed (V_avg) is found by dividing the total distance by the total time spent on the activities:V_avg = D_total / Time (in hours)In this case, the average speed is an arithmetic mean, as it's a simple average of the speeds achieved during each mode of transportation without considering any variations or weights.The subject of the "average speed" calculation is the athlete, as it reflects their combined performance in running and biking. This average speed gives an indication of their overall pace for the day, regardless of whether they were faster on one activity or the other.The context in which this average speed is relevant is when assessing the athlete's endurance or comparing their performance across different days. By calculating V_avg, we can gauge how efficiently they utilized their time and energy during the combined running and biking session.The values M and N are directly related to the average speed formula, as they contribute to the numerator (total distance), while the time taken (4 hours) serves as the denominator, ultimately determining the rate at which the athlete covered the combined distance.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Aeroplane, square, four sides, 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, 800 km/hr, average speed, field.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation can be used to calculate the total distance traveled by the plane around the square? 2. How many sides does the square have? 3. How many trips does the plane make around the square? 4. What is the time taken for each trip? 5. What is the average speed of the plane around the field? 6. Is the time taken for each trip considered when calculating the average speed?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: 1. The total distance traveled by the plane around the square is equal to the sum of the lengths of all four sides, which is 4 times the length of one side. 2. The square has four sides, so the total distance is 4 times the length of one side. 3. The plane makes four trips around the square, since it flies over each side twice. 4. The time taken for each trip depends on the speed of the plane, which is given as 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr. 5. The average speed around the field is the total distance divided by the total time taken, considering the multiple trips made around the square. 6. The time taken for each trip is not included in the calculation of the average speed.
Step 4: Apply the appropriate formula to calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time Average Speed = 4 x Length of One Side / Total Time The total time taken is the sum of the time taken for each trip: Total Time = 2 x (Time taken on the first trip) + 2 x (Time taken on the second trip) + 2 x (Time taken on the third trip) + 2 x (Time taken on the fourth trip)
Step 5: Substitute the values:
Average Speed = 4 x 200 km/hr / (2 x 200 km/hr + 2 x 400 km/hr + 2 x 600 km/hr + 2 x 800 km/hr) Average Speed = 4 x 200 km/hr / 2 x 1000 km/hr Average Speed = 4 x 0.2 Average Speed = 0.8 km/hr
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
We can use combinatorics to solve this problem. There are four books, and Anna wants to arrange them in every possible combination. This means there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the books. Since each arrangement takes one minute, it would take Anna 4! minutes to arrange all the books.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 35 minutes.

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Question:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sharon, 5 hours, Karen, 4 hours, buy the cake together..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long Sharon and Karen work together before they can afford the cake?2. How many total hours of work do Sharon and Karen have combined?3. Who works longer initially, Sharon or Karen, and by how many hours?4. In what situation does the combined work hours of Sharon and Karen equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone?5. When they work together, after how many hours will their combined earnings equal the cost of the cake?6. What is the mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together based on their individual work hours?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Sharon and Karen are saving up to buy a cake that costs $24. Each hour, Sharon earns $8, while Karen earns $6 per hour. To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Alex, Jacob, toy shop, 7 hours to make a toy, 9 hours to make a toy, total toys made in a month, almost similar number of hours.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the total time taken by both Alex and Jacob to make 35 toys? 2. What is the rate at which each person makes a toy? 3. How many toys were made by each person during the month?
Step 3: Analyze the information given: We know that Alex and Jacob made a total of 35 toys together in a month. Therefore, their combined time must be 35 hours. Let's denote the rate at which Alex makes a toy as X and the rate at which Jacob makes a toy as Y. Then, we can write the following equations: Total time = X + Y Time taken by Alex = 7 hours Time taken by Jacob = 9 hours
From the first equation, we can find out the value of X: X = Total time - Time taken by Jacob = 35 - 9 = 26 hours Now, we can use the second equation to find out the value of Y: Y = Time taken by Alex - Time taken by Jacob = 7 - 9 = -2 hours Since the time taken by Jacob should be positive, we know that there is a mistake in the information given. There cannot be a negative number of hours taken by Jacob. Therefore, we need to adjust the given information. Instead of asking for almost similar number of hours, we should ask for the number of hours each person worked. For example, if Alex worked for 26 hours and Jacob worked for 25 hours, then the correct answer would be option D. However, since we don't have any additional information about the number of hours each person worked, we cannot provide a specific answer.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: car, straight line, uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower, top of the tower, angle of elevation, 45°, 60°, time, reaches the base of the tower.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. Which operation can be used to find the time taken to change the angle of elevation from 45° to 60°? 2. What formula can be used to calculate the change in the car's position due to its uniform speed and the angle of elevation? 3. Who or what is the subject of the problem - the car or the observer? 4. Where does the car move - in a straight line and at a uniform speed towards the base of a vertical tower - and what is the reference point? 5. When does the car's speed become relevant - during the change in the angle of elevation or throughout the entire journey? 6. Why is the angle of elevation important - to calculate the car's position and velocity?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: The operation that can be used to find the time taken to change the angle of elevation from 45° to 60° is subtraction. The formula to calculate the change in the car's position due to its uniform speed and the angle of elevation is given by: Distance = Speed × Time × Sin(Angle of elevation). The subject of the problem is the car. The car moves in a straight line and at a uniform speed towards the base of a vertical tower. The observer is the one who observes the change in the angle of elevation. The angle of elevation is important because it gives us information about the direction and height of the tower, which in turn allows us to calculate the car's position and velocity.
Step 4: Applying the formulas:
Given that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, we can calculate the change in the car's position using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time × Sin(Angle of elevation).
Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, we can assume that its speed remains constant throughout the journey. Therefore, the distance traveled during this time can be calculated as follows:
Distance = Speed × Time × Sin(60°) - Speed × Time × Sin(45°)

We can simplify this expression by multiplying the terms inside the parentheses:
Distance = Speed × Time × √3 - Speed × Time × 1/2

Now, since the car is moving towards the base of the tower, the positive sign indicates that the distance traveled is positive. Therefore, we can substitute this into the simplified expression:
Distance = Speed × Time × √3 - Speed × Time × 1/2

Dividing both sides by Speed × Time, we get:
1 = √3 - 1/2

Solving for Time, we get:
Time = 2(√3 - 1)/2

Therefore, the car will take 2(√3 - 1)/2 minutes more to reach the base of the tower after changing the angle of elevation from 45° to 60°.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time.

 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2.

When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Mr. Sam, train, city, car, travel time, 17 hours, 4 hours lost, return trip.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation can be used to find the total time spent traveling by train round-trip?2. How much time was wasted if Mr. Sam went both ways by train?3. What is the relationship between the total time spent traveling by train and the time spent traveling by car?4. If Mr. Sam had gone both ways by car, how much time would he have taken?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: Mr. Sam's total time spent traveling by train round-trip is given as 17 hours. Since he lost 4 hours going there and back, the actual time spent traveling by train is 17 - 4 = 13 hours. Now, we need to find out how long it would take Mr. Sam to travel the same distance by car if he had done both trips by car instead of taking the train round-trip. Since the distance is the same, the time taken by Mr. Sam would be half of the time spent traveling by train. Therefore, Mr. Sam would have taken 13 / 2 = 6.5 hours if he had traveled both ways by car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: space shuttle, maximum speed, 700 meters, 40 seconds, passing a point, 5 seconds, length of the space shuttle.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation can be used to calculate the speed of the space shuttle?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance covered in a certain time at a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject performing the action of traveling at a constant speed (space shuttle)?4. What event or situation triggers the calculation of the space shuttle's length?5. Is the space shuttle's length the only unknown variable in the problem?6. What is the purpose of calculating the space shuttle's length in this scenario?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Passage:We can use the formula for distance covered at a constant speed to solve this problem. Given that the shuttle travels at its maximum speed of 700 meters in 40 seconds, we can find the speed by dividing the distance by the time:Speed = Distance / TimeSpeed = 700 meters / 40 seconds = 17.5 meters/sTo calculate the length of the space shuttle, we need to consider another related event. According to the passage, it takes the shuttle 5 seconds to pass a point. Therefore, we can write the following equation to find the length of the space shuttle:Length = Speed * TimeLength = 17.5 meters/s * 5 secondsLength = 87.5 meters

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \).

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Train A, Train B, station, every 16 minutes, every 17 minutes, simultaneously leave, again.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time until the trains meet again?2. What is the time difference between Train A and Train B's departure intervals?3. How many times will Train A and Train B meet in a day?4. How many trains are there in total, considering Train A and Train B?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:To find the time until the trains meet again, we can use the formula for the difference in arrival times:\[ T = \text{Number of trains} \times \text{Time difference} \]
We can see that Train A departs every 16 minutes and Train B departs every 17 minutes. This means the time difference between their departure intervals is 1 minute. Since Train A and Train B leave simultaneously, the number of trains is 2.
Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\[ T = 2 \times 1 \text{ minute} \]

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: point, fan blade, edge, rotating, 10 cm from the center, fan, rate of 300 revolutions per minute, distance traveled, 30 seconds.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the rotation rate of the fan and the number of revolutions it completes in a unit of time?2. What is the angle swept out by the fan blade in one revolution?3. How can we calculate the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after a given time when the fan is running at a certain speed?4. Is the point moving towards or away from the center of the fan?5. What is the radius of the fan?6. How long does it take for the fan to complete 300 revolutions?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage: The relationship between the rotation rate of a fan and the number of revolutions it completes in a unit of time is given by the formula:\[ rotations_per_minute = \frac{\text{distance traveled}}{\text{time}} \]The angle swept out by the fan blade in one revolution is known as the arc length. The formula for the arc length is:\[ l = r \theta \]where r is the radius of the fan and θ is the angle in radians.\[ \theta = \frac{2\pi}{360} \text{ rotations_per_minute} \times 300 \text{ revolutions} \]The point on the edge of the fan blade is rotating around the center of the fan. Therefore, it is always moving away from the center of the fan. The radius of the fan is 10 cm, so we can calculate the distance traveled by the point in one revolution using the arc length formula:distance_traveled = rθl = 10cm × \frac{2\pi}{360} × 300π = 100π cmNow, to find the distance traveled after 30 seconds, we multiply the distance traveled per revolution by the number of revolutions completed:distance_traveled_after_30_seconds = 100π cm × 300revolutions × \frac{1}{360} revolutions_per_minute = 750π cm

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: average wage, worker, 15 consecutive working days, first 7 days, average wage $87 per day, last 7 days, average wage $92 per day, 8th day.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the total wage earned during the first 7 days?2. What is the total wage earned during the last 7 days?3. What is the total wage earned during the 15-day period?4. What is the average wage during the first 7 days?5. What is the average wage during the last 7 days?6. How much did the worker earn on the 8th day?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:We know the total wage earned during the first 7 days is $87 * 7 = $609, and the total wage earned during the last 7 days is $92 * 7 = $644. The total wage earned during the 15-day period is the sum of the wages earned during the first and last 7 days:Total wage = $609 + $644 = $1253The average wage during the first 7 days is $609 / 7 = $87, and the average wage during the last 7 days is $644 / 7 = $92. To find the worker's wage on the 8th day, we need to add the total wage earned during the first 7 days to the total wage earned during the last 7 days and divide by the number of days worked:Average wage = ($609 + $644) / 15 = $1253 / 15The wage on the 8th day is$1253 / 15 = $83.

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20

What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2.

When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Machine A, Machine B, put out, yo-yo, every 6 minutes, every 9 minutes, produce, 10 yo-yos, minutes.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the rate of production for Machine A in yo-yos per minute?2. What is the rate of production for Machine B in yo-yos per minute?3. How many yo-yos have been produced by Machine A in the first 6 minutes?4. How many yo-yos have been produced by Machine B in the first 9 minutes?5. What is the combined rate of production for Machine A and Machine B in yo-yos per minute?6. How many yo-yos will be produced by both machines after 10 minutes?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage: We need to calculate the total number of yo-yos produced by both machines in 10 minutes given their respective production rates. Let's denote the rate of production for Machine A as r1 (yo-yos/min) and the rate of production for Machine B as r2 (yo-yos/min). Then, the number of yo-yos produced by Machine A in 6 minutes is r1 * 6, and the number of yo-yos produced by Machine B in 9 minutes is r2 * 9. To find the combined rate of production for Machine A and Machine B, we add their individual rates: r1 + r2. Now, to find the total number of yo-yos produced in 10 minutes, we multiply the combined rate by 10: (r1 + r2) * 10\. This will give us the total number of yo-yos produced by both machines in 10 minutes.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Ram, Krishna, A, B, constant speed, 20m/s, 40m/s, 10 seconds, point C.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation should be used to find the total distance between A and B?2. What is the relative speed between Ram and Krishna when they meet at point C?3. What is the distance traveled by Ram in 10 seconds?4. What is the distance traveled by Krishna in 10 seconds?5. How can we relate the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna to the total distance between A and B?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total distance between A and B, we can use the formula for the distance traveled by the object moving with a constant velocity: Distance = Velocity x Time. In this case, let's denote the total distance between A and B as D, the speed of Ram as V_Ram = 20 m/s, and the speed of Krishna as V_Krishna = 40 m/s. The time they meet at point C is 10 seconds, denoted as t.Calculate the relative speed of the two objects:V_Ram - V_Krishna = 20m/s - 40m/s = -20m/sSince the relative speed is negative, this indicates that Ram is moving towards Krishna, which is counterintuitive. However, we can still solve the problem by converting the relative speed into positive values and using the formula for distance. First, we need to find the absolute value of the relative speed:|V_Ram - V_Krishna| = |20m/s - 40m/s| = 20m/sConvert the absolute value to positive:V_Ram - V_Krishna = 20m/sNow we can use the formula for distance:D = V_Ram * t = 20m/s * 10s = 200m/sAs we saw in the previous step, the relative speed is actually -20m/s, but since we're only interested in the total distance between A and B, we'll use the positive version of the distance traveled by Ram:200m/s = D = V_Ram * tSince the relative speed is negative, this means that Krishna is moving towards Ram. Therefore, the total distance between A and B is twice the distance traveled by Krishna:200m/s = 2 * D = 2 * V_Krishna * t2 * D = 2 * 40m/s * 10s2 * 40m/s * 10s = 800mThe total distance between A and B is 800 meters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time.

 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2.

When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?

The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Question:In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two trains, harbor line, main line, frequency of 10 minutes, Main line service starts at 5 o'clock, harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M., man goes to the station every day, first train.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. Which operation can be used to calculate the probability of the man catching the first train? 2. What is the relationship between the arrival times of the two trains? 3. What is the chance that the first train arrives within the first 10 minutes of the main line service starting? 4. Is the probability affected by the fact that the man goes to the station every day? 5. Can we assume that the first train always arrives first? 6. Can we calculate the probability of the man catching the first train in general?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the arrival times of the two trains and their frequencies. Since both trains arrive every 10 minutes, we can determine the chance that the first train arrives within the first 10 minutes of the main line service starting. The man goes to the station every day, which means he has a higher chance of catching the first train compared to someone who only goes occasionally.
However, we cannot assume that the first train always arrives first, as there could be instances where the second train arrives earlier than the first train. Also, the probability may vary depending on the man's regular schedule and whether he arrives early enough at the station to catch the first train.
Without more information about the arrival times of the trains and the man's schedule, it is not possible to accurately calculate the probability of the man catching the first train in general. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not clear.

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Company, three houses, Mr Brown, 6 days, Mr Black, 8 days, Mr Blue, 12 days, vacation, 8 days, working for 6 days, number of days to complete the contract.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the total time required for Mr Brown to paint all three houses?2. How long does it take Mr Black to paint one house?3. How long does it take Mr Blue to paint one house?4. After Mr Brown leaves, who will continue painting the first two houses?5. How long does it take Mr Black to paint the first two houses after Mr Brown leaves?6. What is the total time required for Mr Black to paint the first two houses?7. How long does it take Mr Blue to paint the third house after Mr Brown leaves and Mr Black starts working again?8. How long does it take Mr Blue to complete the entire contract?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Mr Brown paints 3 houses in 6 days, meaning he can paint one house in 6/3=2 days. Mr Black paints one house in 8 days. Mr Blue paints one house in 12 days. Mr Brown goes on vacation after 8 days, leaving Mr Black to paint the next two houses. Mr Black paints the first two houses in 8+6=14 days. Mr Blue takes over and paints the third house in 14+2=16 days. Finally, Mr Blue takes 16 days to complete the entire contract.

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Cow, field, rope, 14 feet long, 10 sq ft per day, time taken.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the formula to calculate the total area of the field? 2. How can we calculate the time taken by the cow to graze the field if it grazes 10 sq ft per day? 3. Is the rope long enough to graze the entire field? 4. Who is the subject performing the action of grazing? 5. Where does the problem take place? 6. When does the cow start its grazing?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: The cow can be considered a variable, and its motion is related to the length of the rope and the area of the field. The formula for calculating the total area of a rectangle is A = lw, where l is the length and w is the width. Given that the rope is 14 feet long, the cow can graze only one side of the field. Therefore, the width of the field is the remaining side, w = 14 feet. Thus, the total area of the field is A = lw = 14 feet * w. To find the time taken by the cow to graze the entire field, we can divide the total area by the area grazed per day: Time = Total Area / Grazed AreaTime = 14 feet * w / 10 sq ft Time = 14 feet * (14 feet / 10 feet)Time = 19.6 days However, since cows cannot graze fractional amounts of land, the actual time taken will be closer to the nearest whole number. The answer should be rounded off to a whole number, so we choose the closest option among A through E. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars?
 Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Car 'X', distance 320 kms, 8 hours, Car 'Y', distance 415 kms, 5 hours, speed difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which car has a higher speed: Car 'X' or Car 'Y'?2. How far does Car 'X' travel per hour?3. What is the speed of Car 'X' in kilometers per hour?4. How far does Car 'Y' travel per hour?5. What is the speed of Car 'Y' in kilometers per hour?6. To find the speed difference, how many kilometers per hour does Car 'Y' travel more than Car 'X'?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After analyzing the given data, we can determine the speeds and distances traveled by both cars, Car 'X' and Car 'Y'. Unfortunately, no specific numerical values were provided for the speeds or distances. However, we can assume that if you have the necessary information, such as their respective speeds in miles per hour (mph) or meters per second (m/s), we can convert them into kilometers per hour (km/h) using the following conversions:1 mph = 1.60934 km/h1 m/s = 3.6 km/hTo compare the speeds, let's denote the speed of Car 'X' as \( V_X \) (in km/h) and the speed of Car 'Y' as \( V_Y \) (also in km/h). If \( V_X > V_Y \), then Car 'X' has a higher speed.For the distances traveled per hour, we would need the time traveled for each car to calculate the distance covered. Assuming they travel at constant speeds, the distance \( D_X \) for Car 'X' in one hour is \( V_X \) multiplied by the time, and similarly for Car 'Y', the distance \( D_Y \) is \( V_Y \) times the time.The speed difference between Car 'Y' and Car 'X' is calculated as \( |V_Y - V_X| \) (absolute value since we are only interested in the magnitude).Without the actual speeds, we cannot provide specific numbers for these calculations. However, if you provide the speeds or any other relevant data, we can easily perform the calculations and construct the passage accordingly.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train fare, one person, Agra, Aligarh, total fare, 6 persons (bus), 8 persons (train), Rs.1512.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the bus fare for two persons based on the given ratio?2. What equation can be set up to represent the relationship between the bus fare and the train fare for one person?3. Who are the travelers involved in this scenario (6 persons on buses and 8 persons on trains)?4. Where is the travel taking place - Agra and Aligarh?5. When does the problem provide a timeframe or context - the total fare paid for a specific journey?6. Why is the train fare for one person important to determine - to compare it with the bus fare or to calculate the total cost for the given number of travelers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where six individuals traveled by bus and eight by train between Agra and Aligarh, the ratio of bus fare to train fare for one person was given. To find the bus fare for two persons, we first need to establish the operational formula. Assuming the ratio is constant, if B represents the bus fare for one person and T represents the train fare for one person, we can write the equation B/T = bus fare ratio.Given that there are two people on the bus, we double the bus fare per person. So, the bus fare for two persons (B2) would be 2B. To calculate this, we need to know the actual value of the ratio or the fares themselves. Once we have this information, we can plug it into the equation:B2 = 2 * (B / T)The train fare for one person is crucial to determine because it allows us to set up the comparison between the two modes of transportation. This comparison not only helps in understanding the relative cost but also enables us to calculate the total cost for the entire group of travelers, which in this case includes both bus passengers (6 * B2) and train passengers (8 * T). By knowing the train fare, we can easily find the total fare paid for the specific journey, providing a timeframe and context for the trip.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Train A, Mumbai Central, Lucknow, 11 am, speed 40 kmph, Train B, Mumbai Central, Lucknow, 2 pm, speed 72 kmph, time of meeting.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two trains?2. What is the distance between the two cities?3. What is the relative speed of Train A compared to Train B?4. What is the distance that Train A will cover in 11 hours?5. What is the distance that Train B will cover in 3 hours?6. What is the time at which Train A will reach halfway between the two cities?7. How much time will it take for Train B to cover the remaining distance after reaching halfway between the two cities?8. When will the two trains meet each other?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the time difference between the two trains, we can use the formula for time of meeting (distance between the trains divided by their relative speed):
time = distance / relative speed
For Train A:
time_A = distance_B / speed_B
time_A = distance_B / 72 kmph

Since we don't have the exact distance between the two cities, we cannot provide an exact time for the meeting. The passage would be incomplete without this information.

When Train A leaves at 11 am, it will reach halfway between the two cities at:
time_halfway = 11 hours * 0.5 = 5.5 hours
At this point, Train B will have covered:
distance_B = 72 kmph * 5.5 hours = 396 km
So, Train B will have to cover the remaining distance of 104 km in 3 hours:
distance_B = 104 km / 72 kmph = 1.45 hours

The total time for Train B to reach the meeting point is:
total_time = time_halfway + time_remaining
total_time = 5.5 hours + 1.45 hours
total_time = 7 hours

Therefore, Train B will arrive at the meeting point at 2 pm on the same day. Thus, the answer is option D (2 pm on the next day).

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:An astronaut weighing 211 pounds on Earth would weigh 182 pounds on Venus. The weight of the astronaut on Venus would be approximately what percent of the astronaut’s weight on Earth? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 60% (C) 70% (D) 86% (E) 90%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Astronaut, weight on Earth, weight on Venus, approximate weight percentage.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the relationship between the weight of an astronaut on Earth and Venus? 2. What is the current weight of the astronaut on Earth? 3. What is the approximate weight of the astronaut on Venus? 4. What is the percentage of the astronaut's weight on Earth represented by the approximate weight on Venus? 5. Can the astronaut's weight on Venus be expressed as a fraction of his weight on Earth?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

- An astronaut's weight on Earth is directly proportional to the gravitational force experienced by him on Earth, while his weight on Venus would be inversely proportional to the gravitational force experienced by him on Venus. The ratio of these two weights would remain constant regardless of the astronaut's weight.
- Let's denote the weight of the astronaut on Earth as W_E and the weight on Venus as W_V. Since the ratio of these two weights remains constant, we can write the following equation: W_E / W_V = 1 / (1 + g_E / g_V)

where g_E and g_V are the gravitational forces experienced by the astronaut on Earth and Venus respectively. We know that g_E = 9.8 m/s² and g_V = 8.87 m/s².

- Given that the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth, his weight on Earth can be calculated as:
W_E = 211 lb * 0.45359237 kg/lb = 962.26 kg

- Substituting the known values into the equation, we get:
962.26 kg / W_V = 1 / (1 + 9.8 m/s² / 8.87 m/s²)
962.26 kg / W_V = 1 / 1.1044

- Solving for W_V, we get:
W_V = 962.26 kg / 1.1044 = 871.33 kg

- Therefore, the approximate weight of the astronaut on Venus would be 871.33 kg. 

- To find the percentage of the astronaut's weight on Earth represented by the approximate weight on Venus, we can divide the weight on Venus by the weight on Earth and multiply by 100:
Approximate Weight Percentage = (871.33 kg / 962.26 kg) * 100% ≈ 90%

So, the approximate weight of the astronaut on Venus would be around 90% of his weight on Earth.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:book, Rs 27.50, profit of 10%, Rs. 25.75, percentage of profit and loss..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation determines the cost price of the book based on the selling price and the given profit percentage?2. What percentage increase or decrease in the selling price would result in a 2% profit or 3% profit or loss if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75?3. Who are the parties involved in this situation - the seller, the buyer, and the profit or loss calculation?4. Where does the concept of break-even point come into play when calculating the profit or loss for the book at Rs. 25.75?5. When does the change in selling price from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75 affect the profitability of the sale?6. Why is it important to find the exact percentage of profit or loss for the book when sold at Rs. 25.75, given the initial profit of 10%?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a business transaction involving the sale of a book, the cost price (C.P.) can be determined using the selling price (S.P.) and the given profit percentage. The relationship between these values is governed by the formula for calculating profit: Profit = (S.P. - C.P.) / C.P. To find the cost price, one would use the formula C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit Percentage / 100). For instance, if the book is initially sold for Rs. 25.75 with a 10% profit, we can calculate the cost price as follows:C.P. = 25.75 / (1 + 10/100) = 25.75 / 1.10 ≈ Rs. 23.41Now, let's consider the impact of a percentage change in the selling price on the profit or loss. If the book needs to generate a 2% profit at the new selling price, we would have:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 2/100) = 25.75 * 1.02 ≈ Rs. 26.26Similarly, for a 3% profit:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 3/100) = 25.75 * 1.03 ≈ Rs. 26.68On the other hand, for a 3% loss:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 - 3/100) = 25.75 * 0.97 ≈ Rs. 24.71The parties involved in this scenario are the seller, who sets the cost price and aims to make a profit, and the buyer, who purchases the book at the selling price. The concept of the break-even point comes into play when the profit margin is zero, which doesn't apply directly to the given Rs. 25.75 but serves as a reference for understanding when the seller neither makes nor loses money.When the selling price changes from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75, it reduces the potential profit because the higher initial price would have allowed for a larger margin. The profitability of the sale is affected negatively as the difference between the selling price and the cost price shrinks.Lastly, finding the exact percentage of profit or loss when the book is sold at Rs. 25.75 is crucial because it provides an accurate assessment of the business performance. Without this figure, it would be difficult to gauge the efficiency of the pricing strategy or make informed decisions about future pricing or production levels.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:grocer, 25% profit, selling price, $100, profit, $3000.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the percentage increase in the selling price of a bag of flour that represents a 25% profit?2. What is the selling price of a bag of flour when there is a 25% profit?3. How much profit does the grocer make per bag of flour if the selling price is $100?4. How many bags of flour did the grocer sell if they made $3,000 in profit?

We can solve this problem by plugging in the known quantities into the equation for profit per bag:
Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price
Profit per bag = $100 - Cost price
Profit = Profit per bag x Number of bags sold

Let's solve these equations:

Step 3: Analyzing the new questions can inferr that:

- The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour, so the percentage increase in the selling price that represents a 25% profit is 25%.
- The selling price of a bag of flour when there is a 25% profit is $100 + 25% * $100 = $125.
- The profit per bag of flour is $125 - $100 = $25.
- The grocer made $3,000 in profit, so the number of bags sold must be:

Number of bags sold = Profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $25
Number of bags sold = 120

However, since we cannot sell a fraction of a bag, we need to round up the answer to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the grocer sold 12 bags of flour.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:book, Rs 27.50, profit of 10%, Rs. 25.75, percentage of profit and loss..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation determines the cost price of the book based on the selling price and the given profit percentage?2. What percentage increase or decrease in the selling price would result in a 2% profit or 3% profit or loss if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75?3. Who are the parties involved in this situation - the seller, the buyer, and the profit or loss calculation?4. Where does the concept of break-even point come into play when calculating the profit or loss for the book at Rs. 25.75?5. When does the change in selling price from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75 affect the profitability of the sale?6. Why is it important to find the exact percentage of profit or loss for the book when sold at Rs. 25.75, given the initial profit of 10%?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a business transaction involving the sale of a book, the cost price (C.P.) can be determined using the selling price (S.P.) and the given profit percentage. The relationship between these values is governed by the formula for calculating profit: Profit = (S.P. - C.P.) / C.P. To find the cost price, one would use the formula C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit Percentage / 100). For instance, if the book is initially sold for Rs. 25.75 with a 10% profit, we can calculate the cost price as follows:C.P. = 25.75 / (1 + 10/100) = 25.75 / 1.10 ≈ Rs. 23.41Now, let's consider the impact of a percentage change in the selling price on the profit or loss. If the book needs to generate a 2% profit at the new selling price, we would have:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 2/100) = 25.75 * 1.02 ≈ Rs. 26.26Similarly, for a 3% profit:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 3/100) = 25.75 * 1.03 ≈ Rs. 26.68On the other hand, for a 3% loss:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 - 3/100) = 25.75 * 0.97 ≈ Rs. 24.71The parties involved in this scenario are the seller, who sets the cost price and aims to make a profit, and the buyer, who purchases the book at the selling price. The concept of the break-even point comes into play when the profit margin is zero, which doesn't apply directly to the given Rs. 25.75 but serves as a reference for understanding when the seller neither makes nor loses money.When the selling price changes from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75, it reduces the potential profit because the higher initial price would have allowed for a larger margin. The profitability of the sale is affected negatively as the difference between the selling price and the cost price shrinks.Lastly, finding the exact percentage of profit or loss when the book is sold at Rs. 25.75 is crucial because it provides an accurate assessment of the business performance. Without this figure, it would be difficult to gauge the efficiency of the pricing strategy or make informed decisions about future pricing or production levels.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Ace Book Company, sales revenue, novels, 34%, biographies, 1/3, ratio.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the percentage of Ace Book Company's sales revenue that comes from novels? 2. What is the percentage of Ace Book Company's sales revenue that comes from biographies? 3. What is the relationship between the two percentages? 4. How many times does the revenue from novels equal the revenue from biographies?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions, we can infer that:

  1. The percentage of Ace Book Company's sales revenue that comes from novels is 34%.
  2. The percentage of Ace Book Company's sales revenue that comes from biographies is 1/3 of the remaining revenue.
  3. Therefore, the revenue from novels is 34% of the total revenue, and the revenue from biographies is 1/3 of the remaining revenue after the revenue from novels has been taken away.
  4. The question asks us to find out how many times the revenue from novels equals the revenue from biographies. To do this, we need to find out how much revenue is left after the revenue from novels is taken away. We can do this by dividing the total revenue by 1 - 34% = 66%.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 3.1.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Jack, sharpeners, white, brown, 100 rupees, 1 rupee more per white, total number of sharpeners.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the total cost of the sharpeners? 2. How much does Jack pay for each brown sharpener? 3. How much does Jack pay for each white sharpener? 4. How many brown sharpeners did Jack buy? 5. How many white sharpeners did Jack buy?

We can solve this question by creating two equations:
1. The total cost of the sharpeners is given as 100 rupees. Therefore, we can write: Total Cost = White Cost + Brown Cost
2. We also know that Jack paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than brown. So, we can write: White Cost = Brown Cost + 1
3. Let us substitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3 into equation 1: 100 = (Brown Cost + 1) + Brown Cost
4. Solving for Brown Cost, we get: Brown Cost = 49 rupees
5. Now we can find the number of white sharpeners by substituting the value of Brown Cost back into equation 2: White Cost = Brown Cost + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50 rupees
6. Therefore, Jack bought 18 sharpeners, out of which 50 were white and 49 were brown.

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct answer is option (E), 11,12.

The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: subscription, 15 issues, $42.00, savings of 25%, cover price per issue.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much would the subscription cost without the 25% discount?2. What is the ratio of the current subscription cost to the cover price per issue?3. How much is the discount for each issue?4. If the subscription costs $42.00 and represents a 25% discount off the cover price, what is the cover price per issue?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the subscription cost without the discount, we need to divide the current cost by the percentage discount: Subscription without discount = $42.00 / 0.75 = $56.00. Now, let's find the ratio of the current subscription cost to the cover price per issue. We can write the ratio as follows:Subscription cost / Cover price per issue = $56.00 / xWe know that the ratio is equal to 1 because the subscription covers 15 issues, so:1 = $56.00 / xSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:56.00 = $56.00 / x \times xx = 1This means that the cover price per issue is the same as the subscription cost, which is $56.00. However, the problem states that the subscription represents a 25% discount off the cover price, so we need to subtract the discount from the subscription cost to find the actual cover price per issue:Cover price per issue = Subscription cost - Discount = $56.00 - $42.00Cover price per issue = $14.00

 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Trader, article, profit, Rs.360, cost price.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the profit percentage earned by the trader? 2. What is the cost price of the article if the trader made a profit of Rs.360? 3. How much did the trader earn for the article if the profit percentage is 20%? 4. How much did the trader spend for the article if the profit percentage is 20%? 5. What is the formula to calculate the cost price given a profit percentage?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The profit percentage earned by the trader is given as 20%. We can use the formula to calculate the cost price: Cost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Percentage)
Given the profit of Rs.360, we can substitute the values in the formula: Cost Price = 360 / (1 + 0.20)
Now, let's solve for the cost price:
Cost Price = 360 / 1.20 = 300
Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000? Answer Choices: (A) 81900 (B) 85995 (C) 85800 (D) 90000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: population, current population, 78000, 5%, 2 years.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the annual growth rate of the city's population?2. How can we calculate the population of the city in two years if the population grows by 5% every year?3. Is the growth rate a constant or variable?4. In what context does this question arise - a prediction or an actual situation?5. What would happen if the growth rate were different?6. Why is it important to know the population in two years if the growth rate is known?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

The annual growth rate of the city's population is given as 5%. Since the growth rate is constant, we can use the following formula to predict the population in two years:

New Population = Current Population + Growth Rate × Previous Year's Population × Number of Years

Plugging in the values:

New Population = 78000 + 0.05 × 78000 × 2 = 78000 + 78000 × 0.05 × 2 = 78000 + 7800 = 85800

Therefore, the population of the city in two years will be 85800.

Input:
Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:tires of a certain brand, purchased new, last for four years, cost of $180 per tire, current tires, cost of $40 per tire, repair, last for one additional year, average cost per year, new tires, cost percent greater, repairing the current tires..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare the annual cost of new tires with the cost of repairing current tires?2. What calculation is needed to find the average cost per year for the new tires?3. Who is making the decision between purchasing new tires or repairing the current ones?4. In which situation would the cost comparison take place - at the beginning of each year or after the initial purchase?5. Why is it important to determine the percentage increase in cost for this scenario?6. How can the cost difference between new tires and repaired ones be expressed as a percentage to find the answer choice?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where a person needs to decide whether to replace their worn-out tires or continue with repairs, a crucial step is to perform a cost comparison. To evaluate the annual expense, one must first calculate the average cost per year for new tires. This can be done by dividing the total cost of the new set of tires by the expected lifespan, typically measured in years. For instance, if the new tires cost $500 and have a lifespan of 5 years, the annual cost would be $500 / 5 = $100 per year.The decision-making process lies with the individual, who needs to consider the potential repair costs over the same period. If the average repair cost for the current tires is lower than the annual cost of new ones, it might make sense to continue with repairs. However, if the difference exceeds a certain threshold, purchasing new tires may become more financially viable.To determine the percentage increase in cost, one can use the following formula: (New Cost - Repair Cost) / Repair Cost * 100%. This calculation helps illustrate the relative cost savings or additional expense when choosing new tires versus repairs. By expressing the cost difference as a percentage, the decision-maker can easily assess the financial impact of each option.In this context, the cost comparison would ideally take place at the beginning of each year or after a significant repair event, ensuring that the most up-to-date information is used for the decision-making process. The importance of determining the percentage increase lies in providing a clear, quantitative basis for understanding the long-term financial implications of either choice, enabling the individual to make an informed decision on tire replacement or maintenance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Manufacturer, tyre, tubeless tyres, discount, retailer, additional discount, total discount.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the initial discount offered by the manufacturer on tubeless tyres? 2. How much does the retailer offer in addition to the manufacturer's discount? 3. How much of the initial discount is applied to the retailer's offer? 4. What is the total discount offered by the retailer?

To find the total discount offered by the retailer, we need to add the initial discount offered by the manufacturer and the additional discount offered by the retailer.

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
a. The manufacturer offers a 20% discount on tubeless tyres.
b. The retailer offers an additional 20% discount on top of the manufacturer's discount.
c. We need to find the total discount offered by the retailer, which is the sum of the manufacturer's discount and the retailer's additional discount.

Total Discount = Manufacturer's Discount + Retailer's Additional Discount
Total Discount = 20% + 20%

Since both discounts are 20%, the total discount offered by the retailer is:

Total Discount = 20% + 20% = 40%

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 36%.

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:company, 420 units, production cost per component, $110, minimum selling price per component, yearly profit, $626,400.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the monthly profit from sales if the company sells all 420 components?2. How much does the company spend on production costs for all components in a year?3. What is the formula to determine the total revenue needed for a yearly profit of at least $626,400?4. Given the production cost per component, how many times must the minimum selling price cover this cost to meet the yearly profit goal?5. In what timeframe does the company need to achieve this profit (yearly)?6. How much profit per component is required to guarantee the minimum yearly profit of $626,400?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the monthly profit from sales, we first need to determine the profit per component. Assuming a fixed profit margin, let's denote the selling price per component as SP, the production cost per component as PC, and the desired profit per component as P. The monthly profit from selling all 420 components can be calculated using the formula:\[ \text{Monthly Profit} = 420 \times (\text{SP} - \text{PC}) \]For the annual production costs, we multiply the number of components by the production cost per component:\[ \text{Annual Production Costs} = 420 \times \text{PC} \times 12 \]To ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we can set up an equation using the revenue formula:\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Components} \times \text{(SP + Profit per Component)} \]Rearranging for the profit per component:\[ \text{Profit per Component} = \frac{\text{Yearly Profit Goal}}{\text{Number of Components}} \]Plugging in the given value:\[ \text{Profit per Component} = \frac{626,400}{420} \]The timeframe to achieve this profit is a yearly basis, as specified.To find out how many times the minimum selling price must cover the production cost to meet the yearly profit goal, we divide the total revenue by the number of components and the production cost:\[ \text{Minimum Selling Price Coverage} = \frac{\text{Yearly Profit Goal}}{\text{Number of Components} \times \text{PC}} \]By combining all these calculations, we can create a passage that outlines the process:To calculate the monthly profit from sales, we use the formula \( 420 \times (\text{Selling Price} - \text{Production Cost}) \), where 420 is the number of components sold each month. For the annual production costs, it's \( 420 \times \text{PC} \times 12 \) with PC being the cost per component. To guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we rearrange the revenue formula to find the profit per component as \( \frac{626,400}{420} \). To meet the profit goal, the minimum selling price needs to cover the production cost at least \( \frac{626,400}{420 \times \text{PC}} \) times. This profit per component will ensure a minimum yearly profit of $626,400, and the goal is to achieve this within a one-year timeframe.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? Answer Choices: (A) $50000 (B) $40000 (C) $30000 (D) $20000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Shop assistant, monthly salary, fixed salary, 5%, monthly sales, $1500.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the shop assistant's monthly salary and the monthly sales?2. What is the fixed salary of the shop assistant?3. What percentage of the monthly sales is added to the fixed salary to form the monthly salary?4. What is the goal of finding the monthly sales?5. What is the formula to calculate the monthly salary when the fixed salary and commission are known?6. What happens if the shop assistant's monthly salary exceeds $1500?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:We can see that the monthly salary of the shop assistant is determined by two factors: the fixed salary and a commission based on a percentage of the monthly sales. The relationship between the salary and the sales is as follows:\[ \text{Monthly Salary} = \text{Fixed Salary} + \text{Commission} \times \text{Monthly Sales} \]where the commission is a percentage of the monthly sales. To reach a monthly salary of $1500, we need to find the sales level that makes up the remaining difference between the desired salary and the fixed salary.\[ \text{Monthly Sales} = \frac{\text{Desired Salary} - \text{Fixed Salary}}{\text{Commission}} \]
Since the commission is a percentage of the monthly sales, we need to convert the desired salary to a percentage of the monthly sales:
\[ \text{Desired Salary} = \frac{\text{Desired Salary}}{100} \times \text{Monthly Sales} \]
Substituting the desired salary of $1500 in the above equation:
\[ \text{Monthly Sales} = \frac{1500}{100} \times \frac{\text{Desired Salary}}{\text{Fixed Salary} + \text{Commission}} \]
If the monthly salary exceeds $1500, then the shop assistant has reached their desired salary goal. However, if the salary does not exceed $1500, we need to continue searching for the correct sales level.
Step 4: We can substitute the values into the formula to solve for the monthly sales:Assuming a fixed salary of $500 and a commission of 5%, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Monthly Sales} = \frac{1500}{100} \times \frac{1500}{500 + 5\% \times \text{Monthly Sales}} \]
Rearranging for Monthly Sales:
\[ \text{Monthly Sales} = \frac{1500}{100} \times \frac{1500}{500 + 0.05 \times \text{Monthly Sales}} \]
Simplifying:
\[ \text{Monthly Sales} = \frac{1500}{100} \times \frac{1500}{500 + 7.5\% \times \text{Monthly Sales}} \]

Now we can plug in some values to test different scenarios. Let's try A through E:
A) If Monthly Sales = $50000, then the monthly salary is $1500 (fixed salary + commission), which is greater than $1500, so we cannot proceed further. Therefore, the answer is not A.
B) If Monthly Sales = $40000, then the monthly salary is $1350 (fixed salary + commission), which is still greater than $1500, so we cannot proceed further. Therefore, the answer is not B.
C) If Monthly Sales = $30000, then the monthly salary is $1125 (fixed salary + commission), which is still greater than $1500, so we cannot proceed further. Therefore, the answer is not C.
D) If Monthly Sales = $20000, then the monthly salary is $975 (fixed salary + commission), which is still greater than $1500, so we cannot proceed further. Therefore, the answer is not D.
E) If Monthly Sales = $15000, then the monthly salary is $750 (fixed salary + commission), which is less than $1500. This is the lowest possible sales level to achieve the desired salary of $1500. So, the answer is E. 

However, we should note that this is just one example, and there may be other combinations of sales levels that also result in a monthly salary of $1500. It is important to remember that the above calculation assumes a constant fixed salary and commission. If either of these changes, the solution may vary.

Input:
Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 24 (C) 25 (D) 40 (E) 52
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Salesperson, commission, $250, salary, 10%.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the commission rate? 2. What is the salary the salesperson needs to reach? 3. How much does the salesperson earn from each sale?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions:
1. The commission rate is given as 10% of the sales amount. 
2. The salesperson needs to reach a salary of at least $1000. 

Step 4: Calculate the commission earned per sale:
To calculate the commission earned per sale, we need to multiply the commission rate by the sales amount:
commission rate = 10%
sales amount = $250
commission earned per sale = commission rate × sales amount = 10% × $250 = $25

Step 5: Determine the number of sales needed to reach the desired salary:
We know that the salesperson needs to earn at least $1000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
sales amount × commission earned per sale ≥ $1000
$250 × $25 ≥ $1000
$6250 ≥ $1000
The salesperson needs to sell at least 6 units to reach a salary of $1000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: pen company, fine quality, average 10% defective, delivered 7200 pens, Rs. 10 each, estimated overall profit of 25%, manufactured cost per pen.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the probability that a pen will be rejected due to defects?2. How many pens are expected to be rejected based on the defect rate?3. What is the total cost of producing 7200 pens if only 90% are good?4. What is the total profit from selling 7200 pens if the company promises to deliver them at Rs. 10 each?5. What is the manufacturing cost per pen considering the profit estimate of 25%?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Since the company knows that on average 10% of the pens are defective, this means that 10% of the total production will be rejected. Therefore, the probability of a pen being rejected due to defects is 10%. To find out how many pens are expected to be rejected, multiply the total number of pens by the defect rate: Expected Rejected Pens = Total Pens x Defect Rate = 7200 x 0.10 = 720 Expected Rejected PensSince only 90% of the pens are good, the remaining 10% (720 pens) will be delivered to the wholesaler. Thus, the total cost of producing 7200 pens is:Total Cost = Good Pens x Cost per Good Pen + Expected Rejected Pens x Cost per Rejected PenGood Pens = 7200 x 0.90Good Pens = 6480 Cost per Good Pen = $10 x 6480 = Rs. 64800Total Cost = Rs. 64800 + Rs. 7200 = Rs. 72000Now, to calculate the total profit from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each, we multiply the total number of pens by the selling price:Total Profit = Total Sales = Total Pens x Selling PriceTotal Profit = 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72000We can also find the manufacturing cost per pen considering the estimated overall profit of 25%. The manufacturing cost per pen would be:Manufacturing Cost per Pen = Total Cost / Total PensManufacturing Cost per Pen = Rs. 72000 / 7200 = Rs. 10Now, comparing the estimated profit and the actual manufacturing cost per pen, we can see that the manufacturing cost per pen is higher than the promised profit. Therefore, none of the answer choices provided (Rs. 6, Rs. 7.2, Rs. 5.6, or Rs. 8) match the estimated profit.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, rows, rate, 4 kmph, still water, rate against the current, 2 kmph, rate along the current.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the man's speed in still water if he rows at 4 kmph?2. What is the formula to calculate the speed of an object moving against the current, given the man's rowing speed and his speed against the current?3. Who is the subject of the problem, and what is their action that affects the calculation of the rate along the current?4. In what situation does the man's rate against the current play a role in determining his rate along the current?5. When would you need to consider both the man's speed in still water and his speed against the current to find the rate along the current?6. How can you combine the given rates (4 kmph and 2 kmph) to determine the man's speed along the current?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The problem revolves around a man who is rowing a boat. To find his speed in still water, we can use the basic formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. However, since the question doesn't provide specific distances, we'll assume that his rowing speed of 4 kmph represents his constant speed in calm waters without any external factors.To calculate the man's speed when rowing against the current, we need to consider the combined effect of his rowing effort and the river's flow. The formula for this is:Speed against the current = Rowing speed - Speed of the currentHowever, the speed of the current is not given in the problem. Let's denote it as 'C' kmph. If the man rows at 4 kmph and his speed against the current is 2 kmph, we can deduce that:2 kmph = 4 kmph - CSolving for C, we get:C = 4 kmph - 2 kmphC = 2 kmphNow, to find the man's speed along the current, we use the same formula but with the speed of the current added to his rowing speed:Speed along the current = Rowing speed + Speed of the currentSpeed along the current = 4 kmph + 2 kmphSpeed along the current = 6 kmphIn this case, the man's rate against the current (2 kmph) plays a role when determining his rate along the current because it accounts for the resistance caused by the flow of the water. When the man's speed in still water (4 kmph) and his speed against the current are both known, as they are here, you can directly combine them to find the rate along the current without needing additional context or conditions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: average weight, 10 oarsmen, increased by 1.8 kg, 53 kg, new man.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation can be used to find the change in the average weight of the group after replacing one person with another?2. What is the formula to calculate the average weight of a group of individuals when given the weight of each individual and the number of individuals?3. How does the addition of a new man affect the overall weight of the group?4. Is there any specific information given about the weights of the other nine oarsmen in the group?5. In what context does the problem arise - during a competition or training session?6. What information is needed to determine the weight of the new man?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

The average weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement was calculated as follows:

Average Weight Before Replacement = Total Weight / Number of Oarsmen

We don't have the total weight of the group before the replacement, so we cannot determine the exact average weight. However, we can proceed to calculate the new average weight after the replacement using the following formula:

New Average Weight = (Total Weight Before Replacement + Weight of the New Man) / Number of Oarsmen

Since the weight of the new man is unknown, we cannot calculate the total weight before the replacement. Therefore, we cannot determine the weight of the new man.

However, if we were given the weight of the other nine oarsmen in the group, we could use the above formula to calculate the total weight before the replacement and then use the same formula again to find the new average weight.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E (Cannot be determined).

Input:
Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) s.5050 (B) s.5723 (C) s.5040 (D) s.4950 (E) s.4870
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: discount, 20%, article, Rs.4578, actual selling price.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the original price of the article if it was sold with a 20% discount? 2. What is the discount amount when a 20% discount is applied to the article's original price? 3. How much does Vinit pay for the article after the discount? 4. What is the formula to calculate the actual selling price of an article after a discount? 5. What is the actual selling price of the article when it is sold with a 20% discount?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that: To find the original price of the article when it was sold with a 20% discount, we multiply the original price by (1 - 0.20). Since the article's original price is Rs.4578, the original price would be:\[ Original\ Price = 4578 * (1 - 0.20) = 3662.40 \]Next, to find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 0.20:\[ Discount\ Amount = Original\ Price * 0.20 = 3662.40 * 0.20 = 732.48 \]Finally, to calculate the actual selling price after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:\[ Actual\ Selling\ Price = Original\ Price - Discount\ Amount = 3662.40 - 732.48 = 2929.92 \]
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Employees, winter vacation, summer vacation, 75%, 40%, 20%, Q%.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation? 2. What is the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation? 3. What is the percentage of employees who take no vacation at all? 4. What is the percentage of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation? 5. What is the relationship between the three percentages mentioned in the question? 6. What is the value of Q?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: We can start by finding the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation, which is given as 75%. Then, we can find the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation by subtracting the percentage of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation from 100%:
100% - (75% + 40%) = 100% - 115% = -15%

However, this result doesn't make sense because the percentage cannot be negative. This indicates that the given information is incorrect. 

Given the correct information, we can solve the problem again. Let's say there are N employees in total. We know that:

75% take a winter vacation and 40% take a summer vacation, so (75% + 40%) = 115% of the employees take either a winter or a summer vacation. Therefore, 20% do not take any vacation at all.

Now, we can use the following equation to find the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation:

Q = (20% - 115%) = -95%

Since the percentage cannot be negative, this means that 95% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation. Therefore, the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 0%. There is no such thing as taking only a summer vacation without also taking a winter vacation. So, the answer choices A, B, C, D, and E are all incorrect.

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: original price, discount, new price, promotion, percentage increase.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation is used to calculate the original price after the discount is applied?2. What is the percentage of the original price that the shopkeeper has to sell the items at?3. How does the promotion affect the shopkeeper's profit?4. In what situation does the shopkeeper have to increase the price?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Firstly, to find the original price after the discount, we use the formula:Original Price = Discounted Price + DiscountWhen the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount on all items, the original price is the discounted price plus the discount itself, so we can write the following equation:Original Price = Discounted Price + Discount = (1 - 0.20) * Discounted PriceNow, the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at their original price. Therefore, the original price needs to be equal to the discounted price, and the shopkeeper must increase the price to recover the lost discount.
Step 4: We can use the following equation to find the percentage increase:Percentage Increase = (Increase / Original Price) * 100%Since the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at their original price, the increase in price must be equal to the lost discount: Increase = Discounted Price - Original PriceSo, we can substitute this into the above equation:Percentage Increase = ((Discounted Price - Original Price) / Original Price) * 100%Percentage Increase = ((1 - 0.20) * Discounted Price - Original Price) / Original Price * 100%Percentage Increase = ((0.80 * Discounted Price) - Original Price) / Original Price * 100%Percentage Increase = (0.80 * (1 - 0.20) * Discounted Price) / Original Price * 100%Percentage Increase = (0.80 * 0.80 * Discounted Price) / Original Price * 100%Percentage Increase = 0.64 * Discounted Price / Original PricePercentage Increase = 0.64 * Discounted Price / (Original Price - Discount)
In conclusion, the shopkeeper must increase the price by approximately 64% to sell the items at their original price. Since the shopkeeper is already offering a 20% discount, the effective increase is actually 44% to recover the lost discount.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: mixture, sand, clay, 10kg, 30%, 70%, equal quantities, remove and replace.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How much of the mixture is currently composed of sand? 2. How much of the mixture is currently composed of clay? 3. How much of the mixture is needed to be replaced with sand? 4. How much of the mixture should be removed to achieve the desired composition? 5. What operation should be performed to reach the desired composition? 6. What is the new quantity of sand after the replacement?

We can start by finding the current proportions of sand and clay in the mixture:

Sand = 30% of 10kg = 3kg Clay = 70% of 10kg = 7kg

Now, let's consider how much of the mixture needs to be replaced with sand:

New sand = Current sand + Replacement sand = 3kg + x

Since the mixture needs to contain equal quantities of sand and clay, we can write another equation:

New clay = Current clay + Replacement clay = 7kg + x

Combining these two equations:

3kg + x = 7kg + x

Subtracting x from both sides:

3kg = 7kg

However, this result doesn't make sense because we cannot remove a portion of a non-negative quantity like sand. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the conditions provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Organization, Rs. 6 lakh, equal contribution from each employee, Rs. 60 extra per employee, Rs. 6.24 lakh, number of employees.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much would each employee contribute if they did not have Rs. 60 extra?2. How much more would each employee contribute with the additional Rs. 60?3. How much was the original contribution amount?4. How much was the actual contribution amount after the Rs. 60 increase?5. What is the difference between the original and actual contributions?6. Divide the difference by the original contribution amount to find the number of employees.
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Assuming the original contribution amount per employee was \( C \), then the contribution amount with the additional Rs. 60 per employee would be: \( C + 60 \)If the total contribution amount is Rs. 6 lakh, then the number of employees can be calculated as follows: \[ C \times \text{(number of employees)} = 6000000 \]To find the number of employees, divide the total contribution amount by the additional contribution per employee: \[ \text{Number of Employees} = \frac{6000000}{(C + 60)} \]
Given that the actual contribution amount is Rs. 6.24 lakh, the original contribution amount was:
\[ C = \frac{6240000}{(6240000 - 600000)} = \frac{6240000}{5640000} = 11.25 \]

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D. There are 100 employees in the organization.

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Home Appliance Store, average, microwave ovens, per month, last year, 42, first 10 months, this year, 20, arithmetic mean, entire 22 months period..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the average calculation require to find out the monthly sales of microwaves last year?2. What is the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year according to the average provided?3. Who or what entity is being measured in terms of microwave oven sales in this problem?4. In which timeframe are the sales from the first 10 months of this year being considered?5. When did the change in sales pattern occur, from last year to this year?6. How can we calculate the average sales of microwaves for the entire 22-month period to answer the original question?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the monthly sales of microwaves for the last year, one would need to perform an average calculation. This requires summing up the sales figures for each month and dividing that total by the number of months in the year, typically 12. According to the provided average, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year amounts to the average multiplied by the number of months, which can be calculated as:Total sales (last year) = Average sales per month * 12The entity being measured in terms of microwave oven sales in this problem is the quantity or units sold, which could represent individual appliances. The first 10 months of this year's sales are considered within the timeframe from January to October.A change in sales pattern occurred when comparing the sales from the last year to the current year, potentially indicating a shift starting from November or December of the previous year, marking the beginning of the new trend.To calculate the average sales of microwaves for the entire 22-month period (assuming the first 12 months are from the previous year and the next 10 from the current year), you would again take the sum of sales for both sets of months and divide by 22:Average sales (22 months) = (Sum of sales from last year + Sum of sales from current year's first 10 months) / 22By following these steps and using the given data, we can arrive at accurate answers for the annual and extended period sales averages. However, without specific numbers for the average sales per month or the total sales, the calculations cannot be performed here.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
 Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:exam, class, average (arithmetic mean), highest score, lowest score, x, average score for the entire class, y, number of students, z, excluding, highest and lowest scorers..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the average of the highest and lowest scores in the problem?2. What is the formula to calculate the average of the entire class, given the sum and the number of students?3. Who are the two scores being excluded when calculating the average for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?4. In what context does the problem occur - a single exam or multiple exams?5. When does the exclusion of the highest and lowest scores take place - before or after determining the overall class average?6. Why is it necessary to exclude the highest and lowest scores when finding the new average?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the problem at hand, the process of finding the average involves several steps. To determine the average of the highest and lowest scores, one would typically use the arithmetic mean operation. This method requires adding the two scores together and then dividing by the count of scores, which is 2 in this case.To calculate the overall class average, given the sum of all scores (let's denote it as S) and the number of students (N), the formula is:Average_class = S / NWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores from the class average, we are looking at a different scenario. Let's assume the sum of scores excluding the top and bottom scores is denoted as S' and there are (N-2) students left. The new average, known as the median average, can be calculated using the following formula:New_average = S' / (N - 2)This exclusion occurs in the context of multiple exams or assignments, where outliers like exceptional performances or extreme difficulties might skew the overall grade distribution. By removing these scores, the new average provides a more representative measure of the typical performance for the majority of students.The exclusion of the highest and lowest scores takes place after determining the initial overall class average, but before computing the median average. The rationale behind this exclusion is to mitigate the influence of any extreme values that might not accurately reflect the typical student performance. This ensures a more balanced and fair assessment of the students' abilities.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: average, arithmetic mean, weight, vehicles, 10, 12.2 tons, increased, 2.6 tons, heavy duty truck, weight in tons.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the relationship between the average weight of the vehicles and the number of vehicles in the group? 2. What is the change in the average weight of the vehicles after adding the heavy duty truck? 3. What is the weight of the heavy duty truck in tons?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: 1. The average weight of a group of vehicles can be represented as the total weight divided by the number of vehicles. In this case, the average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. 2. The addition of a new vehicle to the group increases the average weight. This means that the new average is higher than the old average. Let's denote the old average as X and the new average as Y. We can write the equation for the increase in average weight as: Y = X + 2.6 tons. 3. We want to find the weight of the heavy-duty truck, so we need to solve for Y in terms of X. Plugging in the values from the equation into the equation for the average weight of the vehicles gives us: Y = X + 2.6 tons = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons. Solving for X, we get: X = 12.2 tons - 2.6 tons = 9.6 tons. This means that the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 9.6 tons.

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Input:
Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:合金X和合金Y，比例6:9，熔化混合形成合金Z，锌和铜的比值。
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much zinc and copper are in alloy X and alloy Y, respectively?2. How much zinc and copper are present in the final alloy Z formed by melting合金X and合金Y?3. How does the ratio of zinc and copper in the final alloy Z differ from the ratios in alloy X and alloy Y?4. Can we find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z by combining the individual ratios of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y?5. Is the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z affected by the quantity of each alloy melted and mixed together?6. What is the final ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Alloy X has 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper, while alloy Y has 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper. Let's assume the total amount of each element in alloy Z is represented by 'z'.Since alloy X has 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper, the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is:z_X = 6g_zinc + 6g_zinc = 12g_zincSimilarly, the total amount of copper in alloy Z is:z_Y = 9g_copper + 11g_copper = 20g_copperWhen alloy X and alloy Y are melted and mixed, the ratio of zinc to copper remains constant, as it is a fixed ratio in each alloy. Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z can be obtained by combining the individual ratios:z_X/z_Y = 6/9 and z_Y/z_Z = 7/20Since the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z is:z_Z = z_X + z_Y = 12g_zinc + 20g_copper = 32g_copperAnd since we want to find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we can write:z_Z/z_Y = 32g_copper/(20g_copper + 32g_copper) = 32g_copper/52g_copper = 6/9

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? Answer Choices: (A) D/ (M-3)  (B) MD/3 (C) M/ (D-3)  (D) 3D/ (M2-3M)  (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Men, Rs. D, gift, 3 men drop out, contribution towards the purchase of the gift.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much will each man contribute initially towards the purchase of the gift?2. How much less will each man contribute if 3 men drop out?3. Can we express the initial contribution in terms of the number of men and the total cost of the gift?4. Is there a mathematical relationship between the initial contribution and the total cost of the gift?5. How can we express the new contribution after 3 men drop out?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Before 3 men drop out, each man contributes an equal amount towards the purchase of the gift, which can be represented as:   \( C = \frac{D}{M} \)where C is the contribution made by each man and M is the total number of men involved in the purchase. Once 3 men drop out, the remaining men will need to contribute more to cover the cost of the gift. To find out how much more each man needs to contribute, we subtract the contribution each man made before the drop-out from the total cost of the gift:   \( \text{Remaining Cost} = D - \frac{D}{M} \times 3 \)Now, let's express the remaining cost in terms of the new number of men M':   \( \text{Remaining Cost} = D - \frac{D}{M'} \times 3 \)We can now divide the remaining cost by the number of remaining men to find out how much more each man needs to contribute:   \( \text{More Contribution} = \frac{\text{Remaining Cost}}{M'} \)Finally, let's simplify the expression for More Contribution by substituting the remaining cost in terms of M:   \( \text{More Contribution} = \frac{D - \frac{D}{M'}}{M'} \)Simplifying further, we get:   \( \text{More Contribution} = \frac{MD}{M'M - 3M} \)This is the final answer choice.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Input:
Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sam's hard drive, 250 files, infected, virus, worm, infected only by worm, both virus and worm, 50% not infected by virus, files NOT infected by worm.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation connects the number of files infected only by a worm to those infected by both virus and worm?2. What is the relationship between the number of files infected by both virus and worm, expressed as a factor?3. Who is the subject of the problem regarding the infection status of files?4. Where does the issue with the files take place?5. When is this problem set in terms of the infection status of the files?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of files not infected by a virus in order to find out the number not infected by a worm?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a cybersecurity scenario, the infection status of files was analyzed to understand the spread of malware. The first step in the investigation involved determining the relationship between different types of infections. When examining the data, it was found that the operation "union" connected the number of files infected solely by a worm (W) to those infected by both a virus (V) and a worm (W), denoted as V ∪ W. This union represents the total count of files affected by either a virus or a worm.To express the relationship as a factor, we can calculate the overlap, which is the intersection of the virus and worm infections (V ∩ W). If we let X be the total number of files under consideration, the factor representing the files infected by both can be calculated using the formula:Factor = (|V ∩ W|) / XThe subject of the problem revolves around the computer system, where files are stored and potentially vulnerable to infection. The issue with these files took place on a networked environment, where they could easily spread through shared resources.This problem is set at a specific point in time, when the IT team collected data on the infection status of the files to assess the extent of the threat. To find out the percentage of files not infected by a worm, it's crucial to know the proportion of files not infected by a virus (100% - (Percentage of V-infected files)). Since worms can infect files that were not already infected by a virus, knowing this percentage helps to deduce the remaining portion of files that would have remained unaffected by the worm if no virus had been present. This information is vital for prioritizing security measures and understanding the potential impact of the worm alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Deer, caught, tagged, returned, 2001, 2002, percent, deer population, representative, total deer population, forest, no change in population.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation can be used to calculate the number of deer with tags in the 2002 sample?2. How many deer were caught in the 2001 sample?3. What operation can be used to find the percentage of deer with tags in the 2002 sample?4. What operation can be used to calculate the total deer population in the forest, assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002?5. Is it possible to use the given information to estimate the total deer population without knowing the actual population in 2001?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:In this scenario, we are asked to determine the total deer population in a forest based on the sample of deer caught in 2002 and the known percent of deer with tags in that sample. To do this, we can use the following operations:

1. Calculate the number of deer with tags in the 2002 sample: The given information states that 500 deer were caught in 2002, and 20 of them had tags from the previous year. Therefore, the number of deer with tags in the 2002 sample is 500 - 20 = 480.
2. Calculate the percentage of deer with tags in the 2002 sample: The given information also states that the percent of deer with tags in the 2002 sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags. So, we can use the formula:Percentage of deer with tags in 2002 = (Number of deer with tags in 2002 / Total deer population) * 100%.
3. Use the percentage to estimate the total deer population: We can use the fact that the percentage of deer with tags in 2002 is representative of the total deer population to calculate the total deer population. Let's call the total deer population P. Since the percentage is known, we can use the formula:Percentage of deer with tags in 2002 = (P / (P + (100-P)) * 100%. This simplifies to:Percentage of deer with tags in 2002 = P * 50%. Plugging in the value of the percentage (480/500 * 100%) into this equation gives us:480 = P * 50%. Solving for P gives us: P = 960 deer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 60 (C) 28 (D) 26 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Mark, John, half, one-third, Rs.75, Rs.75/-.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the money Mark initially has and the money John initially has?2. What happens to John's money when Mark gives him half of his own?3. What happens to John's money when Mark gives him one-third of his own?4. How much does John receive from Mark if Mark gives him half of his money?5. How much does John receive from Mark if Mark gives him one-third of his money?6. Based on the answers obtained in steps 2-5, what was the total amount of money John had initially?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:We know that Mark gave John half of his money, resulting in John having double the amount of money Mark had. Therefore, the relationship between the two can be represented as:约翰的钱 = Mark的钱 * 2。John从Mark那里得到的钱 = Mark的初始钱 * 2。
Similarly, we also know that Mark gave John one-third of his money, resulting in John having three times the amount of money Mark had. Therefore, the relationship between the two can be represented as:约翰的钱 = Mark的钱 * 3。

To determine the initial amount of money John had, we can use the second equation:
约翰的钱 = Mark的钱 * 3

Substituting the result from the first equation, we get:
约翰的钱 = Mark的钱 * 2 * 3

Solving for Mark's initial money, we get:
Mark的钱 = 2 * 3 *约翰的钱 = 6约翰的钱

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B.

Input:
Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:chocolate store, vanilla, cocoa flavored, squashed, 10%, 90%, both vanilla and not squashed, percentage.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What percentage of the chocolates are cocoa flavored?2. What percentage of the chocolates are not cocoa flavored?3. How many chocolates are not squashed?4. How many chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?5. What operation can be used to find the required percentage?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
  
  
  1. The percentage of cocoa-flavored chocolates is given as 10%.
  2. The percentage of non-cocoa-flavored chocolates is given as 90%.
  3. If 90% of the remaining chocolates are not squashed, then the number of squashed chocolates is equal to 10% of the total chocolates.
  4. To find the number of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we need to find the number of vanilla-flavored chocolates and subtract the number of squashed chocolates from the total.
  5. The desired percentage can be calculated by finding the ratio of the number of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed to the total number of chocolates.

Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

  1. There are 100 chocolates in total.
  2. Of these, 10% are cocoa flavored, so 10 chocolates are cocoa flavored.
  3. Since 90% of the remaining chocolates are not squashed, there are 90 chocolates that are not squashed.
  4. The number of squashed chocolates is 10 chocolates, as explained earlier.
  5. The number of vanilla-flavored chocolates is the total number of chocolates - the number of cocoa-flavored chocolates - the number of squashed chocolates: Vanilla Flavored Chocolates = 100 - 10 - 10 = 80 chocolates.
  6. The number of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is the difference between the number of vanilla-flavored chocolates and the number of squashed chocolates: Both Vanilla and Not Squashed = Vanilla Flavored Chocolates - Squashed Chocolates = 80 - 10 = 70 chocolates.
  7. The percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is:

    \[ \frac{Both\ Vanilla\ and\ Not\ Squashed}{Total\ Chocolates} \times 100\% = \frac{70}{100} \times 100\% = 70\%

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Man, spends, 810, trouser, Rs 70 each, shirt, Rs 30 each, maximum number of trouser, ratio of trouser and shirt.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How much did the man spend on trousers? 2. How much did the man spend on shirts? 3. How many trousers did the man buy? 4. How many shirts did the man buy? 5. What is the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: The man spent 810 rupees on trousers and 810 rupees on shirts. Since the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is unknown, we can express the problem mathematically: Let T be the maximum number of trousers purchased and S be the maximum number of shirts purchased. The cost of T trousers is T * 70 rupees and the cost of S shirts is S * 30 rupees. The total cost is equal to the sum of the costs of trousers and shirts: T * 70 + S * 30 = 810. We can rearrange this equation to solve for T: T = (810 - S * 30) / 70. Since the cost of trousers and shirts should be equal, the maximum number of trousers (T) can be found by setting T = S: T = (810 - 30S) / 70. To find the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we divide the number of trousers by the number of shirts: T/S = (810 - 30S) / 70 / S. The expression simplifies to T/S = 9. This means that the maximum number of trousers is 9 and the maximum number of shirts is 10, and the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:10.

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
 Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jerry, 1-year bond, $5,000, annual interest rate, 12%, compounded every six months, interest accrued, maturity..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation is used to calculate compound interest for this bond?2. What is the formula for compound interest when the interest is compounded semi-annually?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest payment schedule for this bond?4. In what context does the interest accrual occur (e.g., bank, investment firm)?5. When does the interest start accruing, and when does it stop during the 1-year period?6. How much interest would be earned on a $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate if compounded every six months?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To calculate the compound interest for the given bond, we need to utilize the appropriate formula. Compound interest is a powerful concept that allows interest to accumulate not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest over time. For a bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, the formula to calculate compound interest when interest is compounded semi-annually (twice a year) is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Here, A stands for the future value of the bond, P is the principal amount ($5,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.12 or 12%), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual compounding), and t is the time in years (1).Let's plug in the values:A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)A = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2Now, we perform the calculation:A ≈ 5000(1.06)^2A ≈ 5000 * 1.1236A ≈ $5,618So, the interest earned on the $5,000 bond after one year with semi-annual compounding at a 12% annual rate would be approximately $618.The responsibility for determining the interest payment schedule typically lies with the issuer of the bond, which could be a financial institution or an investment firm. The interest accrues continuously throughout the year, and for a 1-year period, it starts accruing from the day the bond is purchased and stops accruing just before the maturity date or the next coupon payment, whichever comes first. In this case, since we are calculating the total interest for the entire year, we assume it accrues until the end of the 1-year period.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Merchant, invoice, motor boat, $20,000, terms 4/30, n/100, simple interest rate, highest.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the meaning of the terms "4/30" and "n/100"? 2. How do these terms impact the calculation of the simple interest rate? 3. Who determines the simple interest rate for the merchant's situation? 4. What is the relationship between the simple interest rate and the discount offered by the creditor? 5. What is the maximum simple interest rate that the merchant can afford to pay while taking advantage of the discount?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

  1. "4/30" refers to the number of days in a month. In this context, it represents the number of days within the month that the creditor requires the merchant to make payments. "n/100" refers to the number of times the interest is charged per year. It indicates the frequency of compounding.
  2. These terms impact the calculation of the simple interest rate because they determine the number of periods for which the interest is calculated. The interest is calculated daily and added to the outstanding balance each day. Therefore, the higher the number of days in a month and the number of times the interest is charged per year, the higher the simple interest rate will be.
  3. The simple interest rate is determined by the creditor who offers the discount. They set the terms and conditions for the loan and decide whether they want to offer a discount in exchange for receiving regular payments on time.
  4. The simple interest rate and the discount offered by the creditor are inversely proportional. The lower the simple interest rate, the higher the discount offered by the creditor. Conversely, the higher the simple interest rate, the lower the discount offered by the creditor.
  5. The maximum simple interest rate that the merchant can afford to pay while taking advantage of the discount depends on the discount offered by the creditor. If the simple interest rate is too high, the merchant may not be able to afford the payments and may not be able to take advantage of the discount. Therefore, the merchant should aim to keep the simple interest rate as low as possible while still meeting the terms of the loan.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years.

Input:
Question:An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
 Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:exam, class, average (arithmetic mean), highest score, lowest score, x, average score for the entire class, y, number of students, z, excluding, highest and lowest scorers..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the average of the highest and lowest scores in the problem?2. What is the formula to calculate the average of the entire class, given the sum and the number of students?3. Who are the two scores being excluded when calculating the average for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?4. In what context does the problem occur - a single exam or multiple exams?5. When does the exclusion of the highest and lowest scores take place - before or after determining the overall class average?6. Why is it necessary to exclude the highest and lowest scores when finding the new average?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the problem at hand, the process of finding the average involves several steps. To determine the average of the highest and lowest scores, one would typically use the arithmetic mean operation. This method requires adding the two scores together and then dividing by the count of scores, which is 2 in this case.To calculate the overall class average, given the sum of all scores (let's denote it as S) and the number of students (N), the formula is:Average_class = S / NWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores from the class average, we are looking at a different scenario. Let's assume the sum of scores excluding the top and bottom scores is denoted as S' and there are (N-2) students left. The new average, known as the median average, can be calculated using the following formula:New_average = S' / (N - 2)This exclusion occurs in the context of multiple exams or assignments, where outliers like exceptional performances or extreme difficulties might skew the overall grade distribution. By removing these scores, the new average provides a more representative measure of the typical performance for the majority of students.The exclusion of the highest and lowest scores takes place after determining the initial overall class average, but before computing the median average. The rationale behind this exclusion is to mitigate the influence of any extreme values that might not accurately reflect the typical student performance. This ensures a more balanced and fair assessment of the students' abilities.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Input:
Question:Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
 Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jerry, 1-year bond, $5,000, annual interest rate, 12%, compounded every six months, interest accrued, maturity..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation is used to calculate compound interest for this bond?2. What is the formula for compound interest when the interest is compounded semi-annually?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest payment schedule for this bond?4. In what context does the interest accrual occur (e.g., bank, investment firm)?5. When does the interest start accruing, and when does it stop during the 1-year period?6. How much interest would be earned on a $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate if compounded every six months?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To calculate the compound interest for the given bond, we need to utilize the appropriate formula. Compound interest is a powerful concept that allows interest to accumulate not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest over time. For a bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, the formula to calculate compound interest when interest is compounded semi-annually (twice a year) is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Here, A stands for the future value of the bond, P is the principal amount ($5,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.12 or 12%), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual compounding), and t is the time in years (1).Let's plug in the values:A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)A = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2Now, we perform the calculation:A ≈ 5000(1.06)^2A ≈ 5000 * 1.1236A ≈ $5,618So, the interest earned on the $5,000 bond after one year with semi-annual compounding at a 12% annual rate would be approximately $618.The responsibility for determining the interest payment schedule typically lies with the issuer of the bond, which could be a financial institution or an investment firm. The interest accrues continuously throughout the year, and for a 1-year period, it starts accruing from the day the bond is purchased and stops accruing just before the maturity date or the next coupon payment, whichever comes first. In this case, since we are calculating the total interest for the entire year, we assume it accrues until the end of the 1-year period.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: one-year investment, $54,080, annual interest of 8%, compounded semi-annually, amount invested.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the interest rate for the investment? 2. How often is the interest compounded? 3. What is the formula for calculating the final amount invested? 4. Is the amount invested the same as the final amount received?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: We need to calculate the amount invested, so we must find the present value of the future value using the formula for compound interest with semi-annual compounding: PV = FV / (1 + r/n)^(nt) where FV is the final value, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. Given that the final amount received is $54,080, we can set up the equation: PV = 54,080 / (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1) Solving this equation: PV ≈ 54,080 / (1.04) ≈ 52,000 Therefore, the amount invested was approximately $52,000.

Question:A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A bag, candy bars, 11 candy bars, three 50 cents each, four $1 each, four $2 each..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What are the different types of candy bars in the bag?2. How much: How much does each type of candy bar cost?3. Which: Which operation should be performed to find the total cost of the three 50-cent candy bars?4. How much: How much does the combination of four $1 candy bars cost?5. Which: Which operation should be used to find the total cost of the four $2 candy bars?6. How much: What is the total cost of all 11 candy bars combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a bag of assorted candy bars, there are various types to choose from. The first type is a 50-cent candy bar, which comes in three different flavors. To find the total cost of these three candy bars, you would perform a simple multiplication, as each costs 50 cents and there are three of them. That calculation would be:3 (candy bars) * $0.50 (cost per bar) = $1.50Moving on to another type, there are four $1 candy bars, each equally priced. The total cost for these can be calculated by multiplying the price per bar by the quantity:4 ($1 candy bars) * $1.00 (cost per bar) = $4.00Lastly, there are four $2 candy bars. To determine the total cost of these, we again multiply the price per bar by the number:4 ($2 candy bars) * $2.00 (cost per bar) = $8.00Now, to find the combined total cost of all 11 candy bars, we simply add the totals from the three groups together:$1.50 (50-cent bars) + $4.00 (1 dollar bars) + $8.00 (2 dollar bars) = $13.50So, the total cost of all 11 candy bars combined is $13.50.

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:money pouch, Rs. 700, 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, one rupee coins.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of coin denominations are present in the money pouch?2. How much: How many of each coin denomination (25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee) does the pouch contain if the total amount is Rs. 700?3. How: Can you express the total value in rupees using the given coin values? 4. Who: If the owner wants to divide the coins equally, who would receive them?5. Where: In what context or situation does this problem arise, like a bank, a store, or personal finances?6. Why: Why is it important to know the exact distribution of coins, considering they all have different values?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a money pouch, the owner holds a mix of coin denominations to facilitate transactions. The pouch contains three types of coins: 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee. To determine the exact count for each, let's denote the number of 25 paise coins as x, 50 paise coins as y, and one rupee coins as z. Given that the total amount is Rs. 700, we can write the following equation based on their respective values:25p * x + 50p * y + 100p * z = 700Since 1 rupee is equivalent to 100 paise, we can simplify the equation to:25x + 50y + z = 7000 paiseTo find the distribution, we need to find integer solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy this equation. Let's assume that x is a multiple of 25 (as it represents the number of 25 paise coins), and since the total is divisible by 100, y should also be a multiple of 50 to ensure the divisibility by 1000.After trying out possible combinations, we find that one solution could be:x = 20 (25 paise coins)y = 12 (50 paise coins)z = 10 (one rupee coins)This adds up to 20 * 25 paise + 12 * 50 paise + 10 * 100 paise = 500 paise + 600 paise + 1000 paise = 2100 paise, which is close but not exactly 7000 paise. However, there might be a mistake in our assumption or an additional constraint. Upon re-evaluation, we realize that to reach exactly 7000 paise, we can adjust the counts slightly:x = 24 (25 paise coins)y = 10 (50 paise coins)z = 16 (one rupee coins)Now, the total value equals 24 * 25 + 10 * 50 + 16 * 100 = 600 + 500 + 1600 = 7000 paise.If the owner divides the coins equally among four people, each person would receive a share of:x/4, y/4, and z/4 coins, respectively.This scenario arises in personal finances, possibly when dividing tips or organizing a collection. Knowing the exact distribution of coins with different values is crucial because it ensures fairness and prevents any confusion or disputes over the division of wealth. Additionally, having a clear breakdown helps keep track of financial transactions and can be helpful for tax purposes or record-keeping.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:The telephone bill, establishment, fixed, varies, number of calls, consumed, bill amount, Rs.1800, 540 calls, Rs.2040, 620 calls, another month, 500 units..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of mathematical operation is used to describe the relationship between the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill?2. What: How can we find the fixed cost of the bill if it's partly fixed and partly varies based on the number of calls made?3. Who: Which entity (establishment) is responsible for paying the varying portion of the telephone bill?4. Where: In what context does this situation take place, like a specific location or industry?5. When: During which time periods were the bills for 540 and 620 calls calculated? Are there any seasonal trends or regular billing cycles?6. Why: Why does the bill change with the number of calls consumed, and what is the basis for the variation? Is there a per-call or per-minute rate?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the fixed and variable components of a telephone bill is typically described using algebraic operations, specifically a linear equation. To determine the fixed cost, one would subtract the variable component, which is often based on the number of calls made, from the total bill amount. For instance, let's assume a basic formula: Total Bill = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per Call * Number of Calls).To find the fixed cost, given that the bill for 540 calls was $120 and another bill for 620 calls was $130, we can set up an equation. Let F be the fixed cost and C be the variable cost per call. The equation would look like:1. For 540 calls: F + (C * 540) = 1202. For 620 calls: F + (C * 620) = 130Subtracting the fixed cost from both equations will isolate the variable cost per call:C = (130 - 120) / (620 - 540) = $0.10 per call.Now we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find the fixed cost:F + (0.10 * 540) = 120F = 120 - 54F = $66So, the fixed cost is $66, and the variable cost per call is $0.10. This billing scenario takes place in the telecommunications industry, where the cost structure is commonly structured with a base fee and additional charges per usage. The bills are calculated monthly, reflecting regular billing cycles, and the costs vary depending on the number of calls made, following a per-call pricing model.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Two sodas cost 300 cents, which can be found by adding the cost of one soda to the cost of another:2 sodas * 150 cents/soda = 300 centsTwo energy bars cost 150 cents each, as stated in the second option. Three energy bars cost 300 cents, which can be found by adding the cost of two energy bars to the cost of one:3 energy bars * 150 cents/bar = 450 centsThe third option states that two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents, so the cost of two sodas is 300 - 450 = -150 cents. This doesn't make sense, as the cost cannot be negative. The statement is likely a typo or misinterpretation of the question. Therefore, there may be an error in the options provided.
In summary, the correct answer to the question depends on the intended meaning and context of the problem. If the intention is to find the cost of each item, the costs would be as follows:

  * One soda: 150 cents
  * Two sodas: 300 cents
  * Three energy bars: 450 cents

However, without more information about the intended context and usage, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? Answer Choices: (A) y/400 (B) 4y (C) 50y (D) 2500/y (E) 5000/y
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: m, y, x, m percent of 4y, percentage of x.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between x and y?2. What is the value of x in terms of y?3. What is the relationship between m and x?4. In terms of y, what is the percentage of m in x?5. Which expression represents the percentage of m in x?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Given that x is m percent of 4y, we can express this as:\[x = m \times \frac{4y}{100}\]Since m is a positive integer, we can simplify this equation further:\[x = \frac{m \times 4y}{100}\]Now, let's convert the above equation into a percentage form to express m as a percentage of x: \[m\% = \frac{m \times 4y}{100} \times 100\% = \frac{4my}{100} \times 100\% = \frac{4my}{100}\]We can rewrite the above equation as: \[m\% = \frac{4my}{100} = \frac{4m}{100} \times y\]Thus, in terms of y, m is 4 times the percentage of y.

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
 Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jerry, 1-year bond, $5,000, annual interest rate, 12%, compounded every six months, interest accrued, maturity..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation is used to calculate compound interest for this bond?2. What is the formula for compound interest when the interest is compounded semi-annually?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest payment schedule for this bond?4. In what context does the interest accrual occur (e.g., bank, investment firm)?5. When does the interest start accruing, and when does it stop during the 1-year period?6. How much interest would be earned on a $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate if compounded every six months?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To calculate the compound interest for the given bond, we need to utilize the appropriate formula. Compound interest is a powerful concept that allows interest to accumulate not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest over time. For a bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, the formula to calculate compound interest when interest is compounded semi-annually (twice a year) is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Here, A stands for the future value of the bond, P is the principal amount ($5,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.12 or 12%), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual compounding), and t is the time in years (1).Let's plug in the values:A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)A = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2Now, we perform the calculation:A ≈ 5000(1.06)^2A ≈ 5000 * 1.1236A ≈ $5,618So, the interest earned on the $5,000 bond after one year with semi-annual compounding at a 12% annual rate would be approximately $618.The responsibility for determining the interest payment schedule typically lies with the issuer of the bond, which could be a financial institution or an investment firm. The interest accrues continuously throughout the year, and for a 1-year period, it starts accruing from the day the bond is purchased and stops accruing just before the maturity date or the next coupon payment, whichever comes first. In this case, since we are calculating the total interest for the entire year, we assume it accrues until the end of the 1-year period.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Professors, borrowed, Rs. 5000, simple interest, 3 years, university, Rs. 300, rate of interest per annum.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the relationship between the interest and the principal in a simple interest calculation? 2. How long did the professors keep the loan for? 3. How much interest did the university receive? 4. Is the interest rate per year or per month specified in the problem? 5. How can we calculate the rate of interest if we know the total interest and the time period?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: Simple interest is calculated as a percentage of the principal amount, which is determined by the following formula: Simple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. Here, the principal is Rs. 5000, the time is 3 years, and the university received Rs. 300 on interest. Therefore, the rate of interest can be calculated as follows: Rate = Simple Interest / (Principal * Time) = 300 / (5000 * 3) = 300 / 15000 = 2%.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Father, Rs. 5100, two sons, Mohan and Sohan, 23 and 24 years old, compound interest, 4% p.a., equal share, 26 years old.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the current amount that needs to be divided between the two sons?
2. At what age will the investment reach its maturity?
3. What is the required rate of return for the investment?
4. What is the time period over which the investment will grow?
5. What is the total amount that the sons will receive at the end of the investment period?

Step 3: Analyze the new questions:
1. The father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan.
2. The investment will mature at the age of 26 years.
3. The required rate of return is 4% p.a.
4. The investment period is 2 years (since the boys will be 26 years old after 2 years).
5. Mohan and Sohan will receive equal amounts after the investment matures.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount that will be available at the end of the investment period:
Since the investment grows at a compound interest rate of 4% p.a., we can use the formula for compound interest:
Total amount = Principal * (1 + R/100)^n
where n is the number of years.

For Mohan's share, let x be the amount Mohan will receive. Sohan's share will be the same as Mohan's share.
x + x = 5100 / 2
2x = 5100
x = 2550

Mohan's share will be 2550 Rupees.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
 Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jerry, 1-year bond, $5,000, annual interest rate, 12%, compounded every six months, interest accrued, maturity..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation is used to calculate compound interest for this bond?2. What is the formula for compound interest when the interest is compounded semi-annually?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest payment schedule for this bond?4. In what context does the interest accrual occur (e.g., bank, investment firm)?5. When does the interest start accruing, and when does it stop during the 1-year period?6. How much interest would be earned on a $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate if compounded every six months?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To calculate the compound interest for the given bond, we need to utilize the appropriate formula. Compound interest is a powerful concept that allows interest to accumulate not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest over time. For a bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, the formula to calculate compound interest when interest is compounded semi-annually (twice a year) is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Here, A stands for the future value of the bond, P is the principal amount ($5,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.12 or 12%), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual compounding), and t is the time in years (1).Let's plug in the values:A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)A = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2Now, we perform the calculation:A ≈ 5000(1.06)^2A ≈ 5000 * 1.1236A ≈ $5,618So, the interest earned on the $5,000 bond after one year with semi-annual compounding at a 12% annual rate would be approximately $618.The responsibility for determining the interest payment schedule typically lies with the issuer of the bond, which could be a financial institution or an investment firm. The interest accrues continuously throughout the year, and for a 1-year period, it starts accruing from the day the bond is purchased and stops accruing just before the maturity date or the next coupon payment, whichever comes first. In this case, since we are calculating the total interest for the entire year, we assume it accrues until the end of the 1-year period.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Simple interest, C.I., Rs. 5000, 2 years, Rs. 72, difference, rate of interest.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the relationship between simple interest and compound interest? 2. What is the formula for calculating simple interest? 3. How do we find the difference between simple interest and compound interest for a given principal and term? 4. Who determines the rate of interest in this financial transaction? 5. What is the total interest paid on Rs. 5000 for two years if the rate of interest is given? 6. What is the formula for calculating compound interest for a given principal and term?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: Simple interest is the interest that is charged only on the principal amount while compound interest is calculated both on the principal and the accumulated interest. To calculate simple interest, you use the formula: Simple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. For compound interest, you use the formula: Compound Interest = Principal * Rate^Time / (1 - (1+Rate)^(-Time)). If the difference between simple interest and compound interest is Rs. 72 for a principal of Rs. 5000 and a term of two years, we can write the equation: CI - SI = 72. Let's solve this equation to find the rate of interest:
CI = SI + 72SI = 5000 * Rate * 2SI + 72 = 10000 * RateRate = 72 / (SI + 72)Rate = 72 / (5000 * 2 + 72)Rate = 72 / (10720)Rate = 0.06666666666666667
Since the rate of interest has to be a whole number, we round it off to 7%. Therefore, the rate of interest is 7%.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:electric pole, height (14 metres), shadow (10 metres), height of a tree, shadow (15 metres).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the tree based on the relationship between the pole's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the pole and its shadow compared to the height of the tree and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the tree's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the tree with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a tree based on the pole's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle.The entities in this situation are the pole and the tree, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the pole (H_pole) and its corresponding shadow (S_pole), as well as the height of the tree's shadow (S_tree), you can use the following formula to calculate the tree's height (H_tree):H_tree = H_pole * (S_tree / S_pole)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the tree's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_tree_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (pole shadow to tree shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_pole / S_treeThen, apply this ratio to the new tree shadow length:H_tree_prime = H_pole * (S_tree_prime / S_pole)By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the tree's height accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cost, gardening, 1-metre broad boundary, rectangular plot, perimeter, 340 metres, rate, 10 per square metre.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total area to be gardened?2. What mathematical procedure should be followed to calculate the length and width of the rectangular plot?3. Who is responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate?4. In what type of setting does this cost calculation take place (e.g., residential, commercial)?5. Assuming no change in rates, when would the cost calculation be applicable (i.e., immediate or during a specific period)?6. How much would the cost be if the cost per square meter remained constant at 10?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total area to be gardened, you would perform an addition operation, as the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The mathematical procedure for determining the dimensions of the rectangular plot involves rearranging the formula for area: if the total area (A) is given, you can use A = length × width to find the length when the width is known, or vice versa, by dividing the area by the other dimension.Once the dimensions are calculated, the person responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate is typically the homeowner or the contractor, depending on the context. In a residential setting, this cost calculation takes place when planning a landscaping project or deciding on a gardening budget.Assuming no changes in rates, this cost calculation would be applicable immediately after obtaining the area and the rate per square meter. For instance, if the rate remains constant at 10 dollars per square meter, the cost (C) can be calculated using the formula C = area × rate. If the total area to be gardened is 100 square meters, the cost would be:C = 100 square meters × $10/square meter = $1000.So, the passage detailing the process is as follows:To find the total area to be gardened, simply add the length and width of the plot. To determine the dimensions, knowing the area (A), use the formula A = length × width. The homeowner or contractor would then calculate the cost based on this area and the rate, say $10 per square meter. In a residential setting, this calculation is immediate. For a total area of 100 square meters with a constant rate of $10/square meter, the cost would be $1000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: quadratic equation, roots, x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, root 1.5, m.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation represents the square of a number?2. What is the relationship between the coefficient m and the root of a quadratic equation?3. How can we find the value of m if one of the roots is given?4. Can the value of m be found by plugging in the root 1.5 into the quadratic equation?5. What is the meaning of the term "root" in the context of quadratic equations?6. Is it possible to determine the value of m without additional information?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:To find the square of a number, you would use the multiplication operation, for example, 3^2 = 9. In the context of quadratic equations, the coefficients m and b are related to the roots of the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0. The roots are solutions to the equation, which can be found using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a.In this case, the root 1.5 is a solution to the equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, so we can plug it into the quadratic formula:1.5 = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 4*1*22)) / 2*1m^2 - 4*1*22 = m^2 - 88m = 0m = 0 or m = -88Since the quadratic equation is in standard form, we can easily see that m = 0 is a valid solution. Therefore, we can conclude that m = 0 is one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, and the other root must be equal to 22 / 1.5 = 14.22 / 1.5 is not a real number, so m cannot be equal to 14, which means m must be equal to zero. Without additional information, we cannot determine the value of m. 

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

When does the fence need to be constructed?6. Why is the given information important for determining the length of the fence?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: The length of the fence can be calculated by considering the number of pickets and the space between them. The space between each pair of pickets is equivalent to the total width of the fence, which is the sum of the widths of all pickets. Let's use the formula for the length of a fence, L = np, where n is the number of pickets and p is the width of each picket. We can substitute the given values into the formula: L = x * 1/2 + x * 1/2 + x * 1/2 + ... + x * 1/2 (n times)This equation represents the sum of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. However, since the question asks for the length in feet, we need to convert inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can multiply the total width by 12: L = x * 1/2 + x * 1/2 + x * 1/2 + ... + x * 1/2 (n times) * 12The last term, x * 1/2 * 12, represents the total width of the fence in feet, which is the same as the product of the number of pickets (x) and the width of each picket (1/2 inch). Therefore, the length of the fence in feet can be represented as: L = x * 12 + x * 12 + x * 12 + ... + x * 12 (n times)
Step 4: Among the given choices, only option (E) represents the correct length of the fence in feet, which is: (13x - 12) / 24

Therefore, the answer is (E).

Input:
Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
 Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:$8.50, cab fare, $3.50, first quarter-mile, 10 cents, additional quarter mile, maximum distance..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile?2. How much does the cab charge per additional quarter-mile?3. How many quarter-miles can be traveled with the initial $3.50?4. What is the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile?5. How many times will the additional charge of 10 cents be applied to reach the limit of $8.50?6. What is the maximum distance that can be reached by adding the cost of the first quarter-mile and the additional quarter-mile charges?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile, you would use the initial fare, which is $3.50. This covers the first part of the trip. The cab charges an additional 10 cents per quarter-mile after the first one. To find out how many quarter-miles the initial $3.50 covers, you divide the initial fare by the charge per quarter-mile:\( \frac{\$3.50}{\$0.10/quarter-mile} = 35 quarter-miles \)For the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile, you add the initial charge to the sum of charges for each subsequent quarter-mile up to the point where the fare exceeds the limit of $8.50. Since the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, we need to find out how many times this charge can be applied before reaching $8.50:Let x be the number of additional quarter-miles. The equation will be:\( \$3.50 + (x * \$0.10) = \$8.50 \)Solving for x:\( x = \frac{\$8.50 - \$3.50}{\$0.10} \)\( x = \frac{\$5.00}{\$0.10} \)\( x = 50 quarter-miles \)The additional charge will be applied 50 times to reach the limit.Now, to find the maximum distance that can be reached, we add the first quarter-mile to the total number of additional quarter-miles:\( 1 quarter-mile + 50 quarter-miles = 51 quarter-miles \)So, the total distance is 51 quarter-miles converted to miles, knowing that 1 mile equals 4 quarter-miles:\( 51 \frac{quarter-miles}{4} = 12.75 miles \)In summary, the cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50, the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, the initial $3.50 covers 35 quarter-miles, the formula for total fare beyond the first mile is the initial fare plus 10 cents per quarter-mile up to 50 quarters, resulting in a total fare of $8.50, and the maximum distance is 12.75 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches. On this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road? Answer Choices: (A) 800 (B) 720 (C) 960 (D) 1140 (E) 1160
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Town F, Town G, road length, 20 inches, 1/4 inch representing 10 miles, actual distance.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the ratio of inches to miles in the map?2. How many inches are there in 10 miles?3. How many miles are represented by 20 inches on the map?4. How many inches represent the distance from Town F to Town G on the map?5. What is the actual distance from Town F to Town G in miles?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:From the problem statement, we know that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles on the map. Therefore, the ratio of inches to miles is 1/4 : 10 = 1 : 40. So, 1 inch represents 40 miles on the map. Now, we can find out how many miles are represented by 20 inches:
1 inch represents 40 miles. Therefore, 20 inches represents:20 inches × 40 miles/inch = 800 miles
Hence, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along the road is 800 miles. 

Therefore, among the choices provided, the correct answer is option A.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
The problem statement states that the length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm and was reduced in the ratio 5:3. We need to find the new length of the ribbon after the reduction.

Step 1: Identify the key elements of the problem:Original length of the ribbon, 30 cm, reduced in the ratio 5:3.
Step 2: Decompose the problem into new questions:1. What operation(s) were performed on the ribbon to reduce its length?2. What is the proportion of the original length that was removed?3. What is the new length of the ribbon after the reduction?
Step 3: Analyze the information:Given that the ribbon was reduced in the ratio 5:3, we can infer that the longer part of the ribbon (the one with a length of 5 parts) was cut off, while the shorter part (with a length of 3 parts) remains. 

Step 4: Solve the problem:
Let's assume that the original length of the longer part is L, then the shorter part would be 3L. Since the total length of the ribbon is 30 cm, we can set up the following equation:

L + 3L = 30

Solving for L, we get:

4L = 30

L = 7.5

So, the length of the longer part of the ribbon was 7.5 cm.

Now, let's calculate the new length of the ribbon after the reduction:

New length of the ribbon = Original length - Length of the longer part = 30 - 7.5 = 22.5 cm

Therefore, the new length of the ribbon is 22.5 cm.

Answer: Option (E) 12 is incorrect because it doesn't match the calculated value of 22.5 cm.

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
In a scenario where a rope of 20 meters is cut into two pieces, the length of one piece will be shorter by 3 meters compared to the other. Let's denote the length of the longer piece as L and the shorter piece as S. According to the problem, L = S + 3. This is a simple linear equation that can be solved to find the length of the longer piece.
By solving this equation, we get L = 20 - 3, which equals 17 meters. So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 17 meters.

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Cross-section, canal, trapezium, 10 m wide at the top, 6 m wide at the bottom, area of cross-section, 640 square meters, depth of the canal.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. Which operation does the area of the cross-section tell us about the canal? 2. What is the formula for the area of a trapezium? 3. How do we relate the width of the canal at the top and bottom to the depth of the canal? 4. Is the area of the cross-section constant throughout the canal? 5. What role does the depth play in determining the area of the cross-section? 6. How can we use the information given to calculate the depth of the canal?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

Passage: The area of the cross-section provides information about the canal's shape and volume. The area of a trapezium is calculated by multiplying the sum of the parallel sides (bases) by the average of their heights. In this case, the canal's cross-section is a trapezium with bases 10 m and 6 m, and the area is 640 square meters. We can write the area formula as:
Area = (b1 + b2) * h/2
where b1 and b2 are the parallel sides, and h is the height of the trapezium.

Given that the area of the cross-section is constant throughout the canal, it means that the average height (h) is also constant. Therefore, the formula can be simplified as:
640 = (10 + 6) * h/2
Substituting the values and solving for h, we get:
640 = 16 * h/2
640 = 8h
h = 80

So, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

 Answer Choices: (A)  13.3542 (B)  15.8113 (C)  18.3451 (D)  19.5667 (E)  20.8888
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, sphere, diameter..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation connects the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter?2. What is the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid?3. Who or what determines the sphere's diameter based on the inscribed rectangular solid?4. In which geometric context does this problem take place - Euclidean space or a non-Euclidean surface?5. When inscribing a rectangular solid into a sphere, what property ensures that all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface?6. How can we calculate the sphere's diameter using the dimensions of the rectangular solid (3 x 4 x 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The problem revolves around the relationship between a rectangular solid and a sphere inscribed within it in Euclidean space. The mathematical operation connecting the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter is the concept of similarity. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the longest diagonal of the solid represents the diameter of the sphere. This relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the three dimensions of the rectangular solid, which states that the square of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two dimensions (l, w, and h): d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2.In this case, let's use the dimensions provided: l = 3 units, w = 4 units, and h = 15 units. Calculating the longest diagonal (d) gives us:d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225d^2 = 250Now, taking the square root of both sides to find the diameter:d = √250 ≈ 15.81 unitsThus, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.81 units, and it is determined by the inscribed rectangular solid's dimensions within a Euclidean context. The property that ensures all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface is known as the 'inscribed property,' which guarantees that the sphere's radius is half the length of the longest diagonal.

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
The problem statement indicates that there is a hollow cube of size 5cm made up of smaller cubes of size 1cm. We need to find the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted after painting the outer surface of the larger cube. The number of faces of the smaller cubes is the product of the number of small cubes in each layer of the hollow cube.
Since the outer surface of the large cube is painted, only the faces that face outward will be painted. There are 6 faces per layer in the larger cube, and since the thickness of the smaller cube is 1cm, there are 6 layers of smaller cubes in the larger cube. Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 6 * 6 = 36 faces. 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 438.

Question:An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:electric pole, height (14 metres), shadow (10 metres), height of a tree, shadow (15 metres).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the tree based on the relationship between the pole's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the pole and its shadow compared to the height of the tree and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the tree's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the tree with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a tree based on the pole's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle.The entities in this situation are the pole and the tree, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the pole (H_pole) and its corresponding shadow (S_pole), as well as the height of the tree's shadow (S_tree), you can use the following formula to calculate the tree's height (H_tree):H_tree = H_pole * (S_tree / S_pole)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the tree's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_tree_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (pole shadow to tree shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_pole / S_treeThen, apply this ratio to the new tree shadow length:H_tree_prime = H_pole * (S_tree_prime / S_pole)By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the tree's height accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
 Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:height of a room, semi-perimeter, ratio 2:5, cost, Rs.260, paper width, Rs.2 per meter, area for doors and windows, height of the room.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the semi-perimeter based on the given ratio of height to semi-perimeter?2. What calculation can be done to convert the paper width from centimeters to meters?3. How many meters of paper 50 cm wide are needed to cover the walls of the room, considering the cost of Rs.2 per meter?4. How many square meters of the room's walls need to be excluded for the area of doors and windows?5. Using the cost of Rs.260 and the cost per meter, how much does it cost to paper the walls without considering the exclusion of doors and windows?6. Given the total cost and the cost per meter, what is the total length of the walls that need to be papered, including the area for doors and windows?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the semi-perimeter of the room based on the given height-to-semi-perimeter ratio, you would first express the semi-perimeter (s) in terms of the height (h). Let's denote the ratio as r, so s = hr. If the ratio is provided, you can simply multiply the height by the ratio to find the semi-perimeter.To convert the paper width from centimeters to meters, you would divide the width in centimeters by 100, since there are 100 centimeters in a meter. So, if the paper is 50 cm wide, the width in meters would be 50 / 100 = 0.5 meters.To determine the amount of paper needed to cover the walls, you would multiply the total wall area by the paper's width. Assuming the room has four walls, each with the same height as the semi-perimeter (s), the total width for all walls is 4 * s. The cost calculation would be done by multiplying the total width in meters by the cost per meter, which is Rs.2. Let's assume the area of doors and windows is A square meters. To find out how many square meters need to be excluded, you would subtract A from the total wall area, which is 4 * sh.The cost to paper the walls without considering doors and windows can be found by multiplying the total width (4 * sh) in meters by the cost per meter (Rs.2). If the total cost is Rs.260, you can set up the equation: 4 * s * h * 2 = 260.Finally, to find the total length of the walls that need to be papered, including the area for doors and windows, you would add the area of the doors and windows (A) back to the total wall area after the exclusion. This can be expressed as 4 * s + A. Once you have the total length, you can find the cost by multiplying it by the cost per meter again.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cost, gardening, 1-metre broad boundary, rectangular plot, perimeter, 340 metres, rate, 10 per square metre.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total area to be gardened?2. What mathematical procedure should be followed to calculate the length and width of the rectangular plot?3. Who is responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate?4. In what type of setting does this cost calculation take place (e.g., residential, commercial)?5. Assuming no change in rates, when would the cost calculation be applicable (i.e., immediate or during a specific period)?6. How much would the cost be if the cost per square meter remained constant at 10?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total area to be gardened, you would perform an addition operation, as the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The mathematical procedure for determining the dimensions of the rectangular plot involves rearranging the formula for area: if the total area (A) is given, you can use A = length × width to find the length when the width is known, or vice versa, by dividing the area by the other dimension.Once the dimensions are calculated, the person responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate is typically the homeowner or the contractor, depending on the context. In a residential setting, this cost calculation takes place when planning a landscaping project or deciding on a gardening budget.Assuming no changes in rates, this cost calculation would be applicable immediately after obtaining the area and the rate per square meter. For instance, if the rate remains constant at 10 dollars per square meter, the cost (C) can be calculated using the formula C = area × rate. If the total area to be gardened is 100 square meters, the cost would be:C = 100 square meters × $10/square meter = $1000.So, the passage detailing the process is as follows:To find the total area to be gardened, simply add the length and width of the plot. To determine the dimensions, knowing the area (A), use the formula A = length × width. The homeowner or contractor would then calculate the cost based on this area and the rate, say $10 per square meter. In a residential setting, this calculation is immediate. For a total area of 100 square meters with a constant rate of $10/square meter, the cost would be $1000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: flagstaff, height (17.5 meters), shadow (40.25 meters), height of building, shadow (28.75 meters), similar conditions.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What operation should be used to find the height of the building based on the relationship between the flagstaff's height and its shadow? 2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the flagstaff and its shadow compared to the height of the building and its shadow? 3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the building's height? 4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved? 5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths? 6. How can we adjust the ratio of the flagstaff's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the building with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a building based on the flagstaff's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle. The entities in this situation are the flagstaff and the building, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the flagstaff (H_flagstaff) and its corresponding shadow (S_flagstaff), as well as the height of the building's shadow (S_building), you can use the following formula to calculate the building's height (H_building): H_building = H_flagstaff * (S_building / S_flagstaff) This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the building's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_building_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (flagstaff shadow to building shadow) using the original measurements: Ratio = S_flagstaff / S_building Then, apply this ratio to the new building shadow length: H_building_prime = H_flagstaff * (S_building_prime / S_flagstaff) By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the building's height accurately.

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Rectangular sheet, perimeter, folding along one set of sides, folding along another set of sides, area.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 
1. What operation is used to find the area of a rectangle? 
2. How many sides are there in a rectangle? 
3. What is the formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle? 
4. How does the area change when the sheet is folded along different sets of sides? 
5. Can the perimeter be used to find the area of a rectangle? 
6. Which answer choice represents the correct area of the rectangular sheet?

The given information states that when the rectangular sheet is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm, and when it is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm. We can use these values to find the dimensions of the rectangle and then calculate its area.

Step 3: Analyzing the new questions:
1. To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply its length and width. 
2. A rectangle has four sides. 
3. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. 
4. The area of the rectangle remains the same when it is folded along any set of sides, as long as the folds are perpendicular to the sides. 
5. No, the perimeter alone cannot be used to find the area of a rectangle.

Now let's use the information to solve the problem:

From the given data, we can write two equations:

P1 = 2(l + w)
P2 = 2(2l + 2w)

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

P1 - P2 = 2l + 2w - 2(2l + 2w) = 0
0 = 4w

Since w cannot be zero, we conclude that w = 0.

This means that the rectangular sheet is a square. 

Now, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a square to find the length of one side:

P = 4s

Where s is the side length.

Substituting s = 48 cm in the above equation, we get:

48 = 4s
s = 12 cm

Finally, the area of the rectangular sheet can be found by multiplying its side length by itself:

A = s²

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: R, S, T, U, line segments RS, RT, ST, and U as the midpoint of ST.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the formula to find the length of a line segment when one endpoint is known?2. What is the relationship between the lengths of RS, RT, and ST?3. How can we find the length of line segment RU given the relationship between the endpoints and the midpoint?

Given that U is the midpoint of line segment ST, we can use the formula for the length of a line segment:

The length of a line segment RS is given by:
RS = RS
The length of a line segment RT is given by:
RT = RT
The length of a line segment ST is given by:
ST = ST
The length of a line segment RU can be found by using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two legs:

RU^2 = RS^2 + RT^2
Now, we substitute the given values for RS, RT, and ST into the above equation:

RU^2 = 5^2 + 17^2
RU^2 = 25 + 289
RU^2 = 314

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

RU = √314

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is approximately 18.04 meters.

Step 3: Among the choices provided, the closest approximation of 18.04 is option A: 18.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: rectangular piece, 150 sq m, length, 1m more than 4 times the breadth, perimeter.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the length and breadth of the rectangular piece?2. What is the relationship between the length and the perimeter of a rectangle?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangular piece?4. In what context does the problem occur?5. How does the knowledge of the length being 1m more than 4 times the breadth help in finding the perimeter?6. What is the importance of the given information in solving the problem?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Passage: The given information states that the length of the rectangular piece is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. To determine the length, we can write an equation: L = 4B + 1, where L is the length and B is the breadth. Since we know the area of the rectangular piece is 150 square meters, we can substitute this value into the area formula: A = L * B, which gives us: 150 = (4B + 1) * B. Solving this equation for B, we find that B = 150 / (4 + 1) = 25 meters. Substituting this value back into the equation for the length, we get L = 4 * 25 + 1 = 101 meters. Now that we have the dimensions of the rectangular piece, we can calculate its perimeter using the formula: P = 2(L + B). Plugging in the values, we get P = 2(101 + 25) = 242 meters.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Rectangular parking space, painted sides, length of unpainted side, sum of painted sides, area.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the length of the unpainted side and the sum of the painted sides?2. What is the formula for the area of a rectangle when all four sides are known?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the parking space?4. Why is the length of the unpainted side important in the problem-solving process?5. What happens when the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is given in feet?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage: Given that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, we can establish a relationship between these two values. Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y. Then, according to the problem, we have x + y = 37 and x = 9. By solving the second equation for y, we can find the length of the painted sides: y = 37 - 9 = 28 feet. Now, to find the area of the parking space, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: A_rectangle = length * width. However, we don't know the width of the parking space yet. But since we know the lengths of the painted sides, we can substitute them into the formula: A_rectangle = x * y. Substituting the values of x and y into the formula, we get A_rectangle = 9 * 28 = 252 square feet.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Step 1:Key elements of the question:phone manufacturer, crates, pallets, each pallet, phones, 4 crates.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of phones per crate?2. How many phones does one pallet hold?3. What is the relationship between the number of pallets and the number of phones in a crate?4. How many phones are there in 4 crates if each crate has the same number of pallets?5. Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming.

Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

What formula can be applied to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width? 3. Who is responsible for calculating the perimeter of the rectangle? 4. Where does the information about the length and width come from in the problem? 5. Why is it important to know the perimeter of a rectangle? Could it be for planning purposes or security reasons?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. It is a simple mathematical operation that can be performed by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

In this problem, the length and width of the rectangle are given as 8 cm and 3 cm respectively. Therefore, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:
Perimeter = 2 × (8 cm + 3 cm) = 2 × 11 cm = 22 cm

So, the correct answer is B. 22 cm.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation connects the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter?2. What is the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid?3. Who or what determines the sphere's diameter based on the inscribed rectangular solid?4. In which geometric context does this problem take place - Euclidean space or a non-Euclidean surface?5. When inscribing a rectangular solid into a sphere, what property ensures that all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface?6. How can we calculate the sphere's diameter using the dimensions of the rectangular solid (3 x 4 x 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The problem revolves around the relationship between a rectangular solid and a sphere inscribed within it in Euclidean space. The mathematical operation connecting the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter is the concept of similarity. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the longest diagonal of the solid represents the diameter of the sphere. This relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the three dimensions of the rectangular solid, which states that the square of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two dimensions (l, w, and h): d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2.In this case, let's use the dimensions provided: l = 3 units, w = 4 units, and h = 15 units. Calculating the longest diagonal (d) gives us:d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225d^2 = 250Now, taking the square root of both sides to find the diameter:d = √250 ≈ 15.81 unitsThus, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.81 units, and it is determined by the inscribed rectangular solid's dimensions within a Euclidean context. The property that ensures all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface is known as the 'inscribed property,' which guarantees that the sphere's radius is half the length of the longest diagonal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Ratio of volumes of a cube and sphere, volume of a sphere, volume of a cube.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the volume of a cube and the volume of a sphere?2. How does the volume of a sphere relate to the volume of a cube when they fit inside each other?3. How can we express the volume of a sphere in terms of its radius?4. What is the relationship between the radius of a sphere and its volume?5. How does the ratio of the volumes change when the radius of the sphere increases?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V_sphere = 4/3 * π * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. The volume of a cube is given by the formula V_cube = s^3, where s is the side length of the cube. To find the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of a sphere that fits inside the cube, we can substitute the expression for the volume of the sphere into the equation for the volume of the cube:V_cube / V_sphere = s^3 / (4/3 * π * r^3)Since the volume of the sphere is divided by the volume of the cube, the result is a fraction. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio:V_cube / V_sphere = (3 * s^3) / (4 * π * r^3)So, the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of a sphere that fits inside the cube is 3 * s^3 / (4 * π * r^3).
We want to find the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of a sphere that will fit inside the cube, which means we need to substitute the expression for the side length of the cube (s) in the above equation. Let's assume the side length of the cube is 1 unit, since it is a unit cube:
V_cube / V_sphere = 3 * (1)^3 / (4 * π * (1)^3) = 3 / (4 * π)
The ratio simplifies to 3/4π.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.
