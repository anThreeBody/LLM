Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this problem.
Let x be the quotient when we divide 2272 by N and y be the remainder. Similarly, let z be the quotient when we divide 875 by N and w be the remainder.
Since the remainders are the same, we have:
x * N + w = 2272 mod N
y * N + z = 875 mod N
We also know that the sum of the digits of N is equal to:
sum(N) = (x + y) mod 10
Now, we can substitute the expressions for x and y in terms of N from the above equations into the expression for sum(N):
sum(N) = (x * N + w) mod 10 + (y * N + z) mod 10
= (2272 mod N) mod 10 + (875 mod N) mod 10
Since the remainders are the same, we can simplify this expression as follows:
sum(N) = (2272 - 875) mod N
= 1397 mod N
Therefore, the sum of the digits of N is equal to 1397 mod N. However, since N is a 3-digit number, the maximum value of its digit sum is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27.
So, we need to find the smallest possible value of N such that 1397 mod N is less than or equal to 27. We can try different values of N until we find one that works.
For example, if we try N = 100, then 1397 mod 100 = 77. If we try N = 101, then 1397 mod 101 = 26. If we try N = 102, then 1397 mod 102 = 35. And so on.
Finally, we find that N = 102 is the smallest possible value of N that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the sum of the digits of N is equal to 102 mod 10 = 2. Hence, the answer is (E).
Therefore, the answer is

(E). 14.

Question:What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use a technique called "stars and bars" to solve this problem. We have 116 flowers total, which we can divide into 3 groups: white tulips, red tulips, and empty spaces. We want to find the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be made.

First, let's consider the case where there are no empty spaces. In this case, we would need to use all 116 flowers, which means that we would need at least one bouquet with exactly 33 white tulips and another bouquet with exactly 33 red tulips. This gives us a total of 2 bouquets.

Now, let's consider the case where there are empty spaces. We can represent the situation as follows:

    * * *
    * * *
    * * *

where the stars represent the flowers and the bars represent the empty spaces. For example, the first bouquet could contain 33 white tulips and 25 red tulips, while the second bouquet could contain 33 white tulips and 25 red tulips.

Since we want to maximize the number of identical bouquets, we should fill up the empty spaces as much as possible. The only way to do this is to put one flower in each empty space. This gives us a total of 3 bouquets.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 21.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use algebraic equations to solve this problem. Let's call the number we are trying to find "x". 

First, we know that one third of 3/4 of x is equal to 21:

(1/3)(3/4)x = 21

Next, we can simplify this equation:

(1/12)x = 21

Then, we can multiply both sides by 12 to isolate x:

x = 252

We can represent the order of the speakers as a permutation of the letters PMMLAM. There are three M's, so there are 10!/(3!) = 10!/3 ways to arrange them. However, since the MP must always speak after the PM, we need to divide this number by 2 to account for the fact that some arrangements will have both MP and PM speaking in the same slot.

Question:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can simplify the equation as follows:

M - N + 396c = 990

M - N = 594c - 990

Since M - N is a difference of two digits, it must be between 10 and 99. Therefore, we need to find all possible values of c such that 594c - 990 is greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 99.

Solving for c in terms of M, we get:

c = (990 - M + N) / 594

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

M - N = ((990 - M + N) / 594) * 594 - 990

Multiplying both sides by 594, we get:

594(M - N) = 990(990 - M + N)

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

594(M - N) = 980100 - 990M + 990N

Simplifying, we get:

594(M - N) = 970200 - 990M

Dividing both sides by 594, we get:

M - N = 1600 - 19M

Adding N to both sides, we get:

M = N + 1600 - 19M

Multiplying both sides by 19, we get:

19M = N + 30400 - 361M

Subtracting N from both sides, we get:

-20M = -30400 - 361M

Dividing both sides by -20, we get:

M = 1520 + 180.5M

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

-180.5M = -1520

Dividing both sides by -180.5, we get:

M = 8

Therefore, there is only one value of M that satisfies the given conditions, which is 8. Hence, the answer is (E).

(E). None.

Question:The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let the three-digit number be abc, where a, b, and c are digits.
Since the sum of the digits of the number is 17, we have:
a + b + c = 17
Since the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, we have:
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
(a + b + c)^2 = 17^2 + 109
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 358
Since a, b, and c are digits, their possible values are 0-9. Substituting each value for a, b, and c in the above equation, we can find all possible solutions.
For example, if a=0, then b+c=17, which means b=17-c and b^2 + (17-c)^2 = 109. Solving this equation, we get c=9 and b=8.
If a=1, then b+c=16, which means b=16-c and b^2 + (16-c)^2 = 109. Solving this equation, we get c=5 and b=11.
And so on.
We can continue this process for all possible values of a, b, and c until we find a solution that satisfies both equations.

After trying out all possible combinations of a, b, and c, we find that the only solution that works is a=2, b=8, and c=7.
Therefore, the number we are looking for is:

287

So the answer is (C).
Therefore, the answer is

(C). 287.

Question:If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
Answer: Let's think step by step.


To determine which statement must be true about Q if it has 5 factors, we need to consider the possible factorizations of Q.

If Q is a prime number, then it has only two factors, itself and 1. However, since Q is given to have at least 5 factors, it cannot be a prime number.

Therefore, Q must be a composite number. Let's assume that Q can be factored into two distinct prime numbers p and q, where p and q are greater than 1. Then, we can write:

Q = p * q

Since Q has 5 factors, we know that there exist integers x, y, z, u, v such that:

Q = x * y * z * u * v

Substituting the expression for Q above, we get:

p * q = x * y * z * u * v

This implies that p and q must both divide x, y, z, u, and v. Since p and q are distinct prime numbers, they cannot divide each other. Therefore, one of them must divide all five of these integers.

Without further information, we cannot determine which of the following statements must be true about Q:

- Q is divisible by 2.
- Q is divisible by 3.
- Q is divisible by 4.
- Q is divisible by 5.
- Q is divisible by 6.

However, we can say that Q is divisible by either p or q (since one of them divides all five of the integers), but not necessarily by both.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let X be the current age of Joe's sister. Then, Joe's age is X + 10 and Joe's father's age is X + 2X = 3X.
Since the sum of their ages is 100, we can write the equation:
X + (X + 10) + (3X) = 100
Simplifying this equation, we get:
7X = 90
Therefore, the current age of Joe's sister is X = 15.
When Joe is as old as his father, his age will be X + 2X = 3X = 3 * 15 = 45.
So, the answer is (A).

Question:A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The age of each member can be represented as:

a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

where a_n is the age of the nth member, a_1 is the age of the youngest member, d is the common difference, and n is the index of the member.

Given that the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, we have:

S = Σ(a_n)

Substituting the expression for a_n from above, we get:

S = Σ[a_1 + (n-1)d]

S = a_1 + (n-1)d + a_2 + (n-2)d + ... + a_n

S = a_1 + (n-1)d + (a_1 + 2d) + (a_1 + 3d) + ... + (a_1 + (n-1)d)

S = na_1 + (n(n-1)/2)d

Given that the youngest member is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, we have:

a_1 = 7
S = 250

Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

250 = 7n + (n(n-1)/2)d

Simplifying this equation, we get:

n^2 - 24n + 500 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we find that:

n = 10 or n = 25

Since n must be an integer, the only possible value of n is 25. Therefore, there are 25 members in the club.

Therefore, the answer is (C).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that if $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with a GCF of 11 and LCM of 7700, then:

$\frac{7700}{11}=700$

and

$\frac{11}{\text{GCF}(a,b)}=\frac{11}{11}=1$

Therefore, we can say that $a=700k_1$ and $b=11k_2$, where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are some integers.

Now, we know that $a=350$. Substituting this into our expression for $a$, we get:

$350=700k_1$

Solving for $k_1$, we find that:

$k_1=\frac{350}{700}=\frac{1}{2}$

Substituting this back into our expression for $b$, we get:

$b=11k_2=11(\frac{1}{2})=\frac{11}{2}$

Therefore, the other integer is $\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can break down the problem into cases:

Case 1: The boy takes only one step at a time.
In this case, there are 10 steps to climb, so the boy has 10 choices for each step.

Case 2: The boy takes two steps at a time.
In this case, there are 5 pairs of adjacent steps that the boy can take two steps at once. For each pair, there are 2 choices for which step the boy will take first, and then 1 choice for which step he will take second. So, there are a total of 5 * 2 = 10 choices for the boy to make in this case.

Therefore, the total number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs is:
10 + 10 = 20

However, we need to consider that some of these paths may be redundant. For example, if the boy takes steps 1 and 2, then steps 3 and 4, and so on, he will have reached the top of the stairs in exactly the same way as if he had taken steps 2 and 3, then steps 4 and 5, and so on.
To account for this redundancy, we need to divide the total number of ways by the number of possible orderings of the steps. There are 10! = 3628800 possible orderings of the steps, so the final answer is:
20 / 3628800 = 5.57e-06

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the discriminant formula to find the values of k that make the quadratic equation have two real and distinct roots:

Δ = b^2 - 4ac

where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k.

Substituting these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

Δ = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k)
Δ = 25 - 4k

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

Δ > 0
25 - 4k > 0

Solving for k, we get:

k < 6.25

Since k must be an integer, the largest possible value of k that satisfies this inequality is 6.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of permutations.

We have 10 bottles of lime soda and we want to divide them into 2 groups of 5 each. This means that we need to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group and 5 bottles out of the remaining 5 for the second group.

The number of ways to do this is given by the formula:

nPr = n! / r!(n-r)!

where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items chosen.

In this case, n = 10 and r = 5, so the formula becomes:

10P5 = 10! / 5!(10-5)! = 252

Therefore, there are 252 ways to create the 2 groups of customers.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula:

Number of helpers = (Total number of cakes / Number of cakes per helper) * Time available

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Number of helpers = (700 + 20) / (2 or 35) * 3

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Number of helpers = 720 / (2 or 35) * 3

Since each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, we can choose the option that gives us the smallest value for the number of helpers.

If each helper makes 2 large cakes per hour, then they can make a total of 480 small cakes in 3 hours. However, this means that there would be 720 - 480 = 240 small cakes left over, which cannot be made by a single helper in an hour.

Therefore, each helper must make 35 small cakes per hour. In this case, the number of helpers required is:

Number of helpers = (700 + 20) / 35 * 3

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Number of helpers = 720 / 35 * 3

Number of helpers = 60

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let x be the first number and y be the second number.
According to the problem, we have:

x/y = 3/5

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:

x - 9/y = 3/5 - 9

Multiplying both sides by y, we get:

xy - 9y = 3y - 45

Simplifying, we get:

xy = 3y - 45 + 9

xy = 3y - 36

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x(y/3) = y - 12

Substituting x = 3k, where k is a constant, we get:

(3k)(y/3) = y - 12

ky = y - 12

ky - y = -12

ky = -12

Therefore, y = -12/(-k)

Since y is a fraction, we can't have a negative denominator. However, we know that the two numbers were in the ratio 3:5, so let's assume that k > 0.

In this case, y = 5/3 * (-12/(-k)) = -20/3k

Now we need to find the value of k such that:

x - 9 = 3/5 * (-20/3k)

x = 3/5 * (-20/3k) + 9

x = -4/5k + 9

We know that x is also a fraction, so we can't have a negative denominator. Therefore, we must have:

-4/5k + 9 >= 0

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

-4k + 45 >= 0

Subtracting 45 from both sides, we get:

-4k >= -45

Dividing both sides by -4, we get:

k <= 11.25

Since k is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for k is 11. Therefore, the smallest possible value for y is:

y = -20/3k = -20/3 * 11 = -66

However, since y cannot be negative, we know that our assumption about k being positive was incorrect. Therefore, there is no solution to the problem.

Question:I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to identify what property the number has when a 1 is added to it. According to the given statement, if a 1 is added after the 5-digit number, the resulting number is three times as large as the original number. This means that the difference between the two numbers is three times the original number.

Let's call the original number "x". Then, the number with a 1 added after it would be "x + 1".

According to the property given in the statement, we can write the following equation:

(x + 1) - x = 3x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 0.5

Therefore, the original number "x" must be 0.5. 

However, since we are looking for a 5-digit number, we cannot have a decimal number as its value. Therefore, there is no such 5-digit number that satisfies the given property.
Therefore, the answer is

No such 5-digit number exists that satisfies the given property.

Question:64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The initial number of boys was 64 and the initial number of girls was 40. The total number of members initially was therefore 64+40 = 104. When the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the number of boys increased by 64/4 = 16 and the number of girls increased by 40/3 = 13. Therefore, the new number of boys is 64+16 = 80 and the new number of girls is 40+13 = 53. The total number of members in the group now is 80+53 = 133.

Therefore, the answer is (E).
Therefore, the answer is

Question:In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 6
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can visualize this problem as follows:

  * There are three chairs, so we need to choose which chair Susan will sit on.
  * Once Susan has chosen her chair, there are two chairs left for Tim and Zen to choose from.
  * Tim can choose either of the remaining two chairs, so there are two possible arrangements for Tim.
  * Zen can then choose between the remaining chair and the chair that Tim did not choose, so there is one possible arrangement for Zen.

Therefore, the total number of possible arrangements is 2 x 2 = 4.

However, we need to consider that there are two different ways Susan could be on the left of Tim. One way is if Susan sits on the leftmost chair and Tim sits on the middle chair, and the other way is if Susan sits on the middle chair and Tim sits on the rightmost chair. Therefore, the actual number of possible arrangements is 2 x 4 = 8.

So the answer is (E) 6.

Question:If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can calculate the total number of votes by finding the percentage of eligible voters who voted for the winning candidate, then multiplying that by the total number of eligible voters.
First, we find the percentage of eligible voters who did not vote:
20% * 5000 = 1000
So there were 4000 eligible voters.
Next, we find the percentage of eligible voters who voted for the winning candidate:
15% * 4000 = 600
Then we multiply that by the total number of eligible voters to get the total number of votes the winning candidate received:
600 * 4000 = 2400000
Therefore, the answer is (A).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We are given that the product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as 727+728+729. We know that the sum of three consecutive integers is equal to the middle integer plus the two integers before and after it, so we can write:
727 + 728 + 729 = x + (x - 1) + (x + 1)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
727 + 728 + 729 = 3x
Substituting in the value of the product, we get:
3x = 727 + 728 + 729
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
9x = 2184
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
x = 242

Therefore, the sum of the three consecutive integers is:
x + (x - 1) + (x + 1) = 242 + (242 - 1) + (242 + 1) = 387

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the given information to write down an equation that represents the total number of students:
1/16 x Total Students = Math Students
1/10 x Total Students = Bio Students
1/8 x Total Students = English Students

Solving for Total Students, we get:
Total Students = 16 x Math Students / 1/16 = 256 Math Students
Total Students = 10 x Bio Students / 1/10 = 160 Bio Students
Total Students = 8 x English Students / 1/8 = 64 English Students

Therefore, the total number of students is 256 + 160 + 64 = 480.

The difference between the maximum number of students (which occurs when all students study math) and the minimum number of students (which occurs when all students study English) is:

Maximum Number of Students - Minimum Number of Students = Total Students - English Students = 480 - 64 = 416

Therefore, the answer is (E).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that there are 5 dozens of toys in each box, which is equal to 5 x 12 = 60 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys in all the boxes is 60 x 98 = 5880 toys.

To find out how many tempos can lift this amount of toys in one round, we need to divide the total number of toys by the capacity of each tempo, which is 29400 / 5880 = 5 tempos.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use algebraic equations to solve this problem. Let's say that Raj's current age is R and Rahim's current age is H. We know that:

- R = 17 (Raj's current age)
- R - 5 = (H/3) + 5 (Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

17 - 5 = (H/3) + 5

Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get:

12 = H/3 + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:

7 = H/3

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 3, we get:

21 = H

Therefore, Rahim is currently 21 years old.

So the answer is (E).

Question:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use complementary counting to solve this problem. The probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is equal to the probability that it has at least one common factor with 1,000. This means we need to find the probability that a number chosen from S does not have any common factors with 1,000.
We know that there are 1000 possible choices for the number being picked, and we want to count how many of these have no common factors with 1,000. We can do this by listing out all the factors of 1,000 and then subtracting the ones that also divide into our number.
The factors of 1,000 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000. Out of these, only 1 and itself divide into 1,000 without a remainder, so the number of numbers in S that have no common factors with 1,000 is 999 - 1 = 998.
Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is:
P(rational) = P(1) + P(2) + ... + P(998)
= 998 / 1000
= 0.998
So the answer is (E).

(E). 2/7.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that the sum of any five consecutive even numbers is divisible by 10. Let's use this fact to our advantage.
If we subtract 2 from each of the given numbers, we get a set of five consecutive odd numbers. For example, if the first number in the sequence is 47, then the next four numbers are 45, 43, 41, and 39.
Let's assume that the first number in the sequence is x. Then the sum of the five consecutive odd numbers is:
x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8)
= 5x + 20
We want this sum to be divisible by 10, so we need 5x to be a multiple of 10. The only choice that satisfies this condition is (E) 44.
Therefore, the answer is (E).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let A be Ajay's present age.
Rahul = A - 6
Denis = A - 2 + 5 = A + 3
(A - 6)/18 = A + 3
18*(A - 6) = 18*(A + 3)
108 - 108 = 18*(A + 3)
0 = 18*(A + 3)
0 = A + 3
A = -3

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let's denote the number as x. We know that 2/3x - 10 = 40 + 1/3x. This can be rearranged to give us 2/3x - 10 = 40 + x/3. Subtracting x/3 from both sides gives us 2/3x - x/3 - 10 = 40. Combining like terms, we get 1/3x - 10 = 40. Adding 10 to both sides gives us 1/3x = 50. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us x = 150.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the product of 25/12 and 5, we need to multiply 25 by 1/12 and then multiply that result by 5.
First, let's simplify the fraction 25/12:
25/12 = (25 * 1)/(12 * 1) = 25/12
Now we can multiply 25/12 by 5:
25/12 * 5 = (25 * 5)/(12 * 1) = 125/12
Next, we can convert this fraction to a decimal:
125/12 = 10.4167

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can express this problem algebraically as:

x = 36 + a, where x is the number we are looking for and a is some constant.

And also,

x < 86

So, we can substitute these two equations into each other to get:

36 + a < 86

Simplifying this inequality gives us:

a < 50

Therefore, the possible values of a are:

a = 49, 48, ..., 37

Since we want the number to be greater than 36 but less than 86, the only possible value of a that satisfies both conditions is:

a = 49

Substituting this value into the first equation gives us:

x = 36 + 49 = 85

Therefore, the answer is (E).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use algebraic equations to solve this problem. Let's say Ajay's current age is x. Then, Sachin's current age would be 2x + 10.
According to the problem, Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. So, we can write the equation:

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ties that can be taken out such that there are at least two ties of the same color.

We know that there are a total of 8 red ties, 13 violet ties, 10 blue ties, 5 pink ties, and 4 green ties in the rack. 

To ensure that there are at least two ties of the same color, we need to select at least two ties from each color category. For example, we could take out two red ties, two violet ties, two blue ties, two pink ties, and one green tie.

Therefore, the minimum number of ties that we need to take out from the rack to ensure that there are at least two ties of the same color is:

2 red ties + 2 violet ties + 2 blue ties + 2 pink ties + 1 green tie = 10 ties

So the answer is (E) 6.

Question:For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use algebraic equations to solve this problem. Let x be the number of copper coins and y be the number of brass coins.
From the problem, we know that:
- For each copper coin, the diver gets 20 cents
- For each brass coin, the diver gets 25 cents
- The total amount of money the diver received after one dive was $3.40
Using these facts, we can set up the following two equations:

x + y = 3.40 / 0.20
x + y = 17

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
y = 3.40 - 0.20x

Substituting this expression for y in the second equation, we get:
x + (3.40 - 0.20x) = 17

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
x + 3.20 - 0.20x = 17
0.80x = 13.80
x = 17.25

Since the number of coins cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us x = 17.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 17. Answer choice (D).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of ingredients in the mixture. The ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5, which means that for every 2 units of rice, there are 3 units of wheat, and 5 units of corn.

If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, then we can calculate the total weight of the mixture using the given ratio:

3 pounds of rice / 2 + 3 pounds of wheat / 3 + 5 pounds of corn / 5 = 1 pound of mixture per unit

Since there are 2 units of rice in each pound of mixture, there must be 2 * 1 = 2 pounds of rice in the bag.

Therefore, the weight of corn in the bag must be:

3 pounds of mixture - 2 pounds of rice = 1 pound of mixture

Since there are 5 units of corn in each pound of mixture, there must be:

1 pound of mixture / 5 = 0.2 pounds of corn in the bag

However, none of the answer choices match this calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of the above.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which means for every 7 sweets, 3 are red and 4 are green. 

If the bag contains 120 green sweets, we can find out how many red sweets there are by dividing the total number of sweets by the ratio:

120 green sweets ÷ (4/7) = 120 green sweets × (7/4) = 210 red sweets

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The frog will jump 3m up, fall back 2m down, then jump another 3m up, fall back 2m down again, and so on.
On the first day, the frog will be at a height of 3m + (-2m) = 1m above the bottom of the well.
On the second day, the frog will be at a height of 1m + (-2m) = -1m below the bottom of the well.
On the third day, the frog will be at a height of (-1m) + (-2m) = -3m below the bottom of the well.
On the fourth day, the frog will be at a height of (-3m) + (-2m) = -5m below the bottom of the well.
And so on.
Therefore, the frog will need to jump 30m / (-5m/day) = 6 days to reach the surface of the well.
However, since the frog only jumps 3m each day, it will actually take 6 days + 1 day = 7 days for the frog to come out of the well.
Therefore, the answer is (E) 29 days.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let the distance between X and Y be d km.
When Allen reaches Y, he turns around and travels back to X in a time of t hours. So, Allen's total travel time is t + d/54 hours.
Bob also travels from Y to X in a time of t hours. After reaching X, he turns around and travels back to Y in a time of t/78 hours. So, Bob's total travel time is 2t/78 hours.
By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. This means that Bob's total distance traveled is d + 48 km, while Allen's total distance traveled is d - 48 km.
Using the above equation, we can write:
d + 48 = 2t/78 * 54 + d - 48
Simplifying this equation, we get:
d = 2t/78 * 54 - 48
Since Allen and Bob start simultaneously, their travel times are equal, so we can write:
t = 2t/78 * 54 - 48 / 2
Solving this equation, we get:
t = 180 km
Substituting this value of t into the equation for d, we get:
d = 2*180/78 * 54 - 48
d = 144 km

Therefore, the answer is (A).
Therefore, the answer is

(A). 144 km.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula distance = speed x time. In the forward journey, the jeep traveled at a speed of 60 km/hr for 6 hours, so the distance traveled was 60 km/hr x 6 hours = 360 km.
In the return journey, the jeep traveled at a speed of 60 km/hr + 12 km/hr = 72 km/hr for 4 hours, so the distance traveled was 72 km/hr x 4 hours = 288 km.
Therefore, the total distance traveled by the jeep was 360 km + 288 km = 648 km.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many men were working on the project each day. Since 8 men worked for 6 days, we can divide that number by the number of days to get the number of men working per day:
8 men / 6 days = 1.33 men/day
Now, we want to know how many men are required to complete the same work in half a day. To do this, we can divide the total amount of work by the time it takes to complete one day's worth of work:
Total work / 1 day = 1.33 men/day * 6 days = 8 men
So, if 8 men can complete the work in 6 days, then we can divide that number by 2 to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in half a day:
8 men / 2 = 4 men
Therefore, the answer is (C) 95 men.

Question:Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula for angular velocity to solve this problem. Angular velocity is given by the ratio of the change in angle to the time taken. For ball A, the change in angle is 2π radians (since it makes two full rotations), and the time taken is 26 minutes. So its angular velocity is:
Angular velocity of ball A = (2π radians) / (26 minutes) = π/13 radians per minute
Similarly, for ball B, the change in angle is 5π radians (since it makes five full rotations), and the time taken is 35 minutes. So its angular velocity is:
Angular velocity of ball B = (5π radians) / (35 minutes) = π/7 radians per minute
Since both balls are rotating in the same direction, we need to find the time it takes for them to make up for their difference in angular velocity. This means that we need to find the time it takes for ball A to catch up with ball B.
The difference in angular velocity between the two balls is:
Angular velocity difference = Angular velocity of ball B - Angular velocity of ball A = π/7 radians per minute - π/13 radians per minute = π/9 radians per minute
To find the time it takes for ball A to catch up with ball B, we need to divide the angular velocity difference by the smaller angular velocity of ball A:
Time to catch up = Angular velocity difference / Angular velocity of ball A = π/9 radians per minute / π/13 radians per minute = 13/9 minutes
So ball A will catch up with ball B after 13/9 minutes. However, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means that ball A will catch up with ball B after 13/9 * 60 = 80 minutes.
Therefore, the answer is (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes.
Therefore, the answer is

(E) 5 hour and 31 minutes.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the total distance traveled, we can use the formula:
Total distance = Speed × Time

For the first part of the journey, the distance traveled was 5 km/h × 6 hours = 30 km.
For the second part of the journey, the distance traveled was 4 km/h × 12 hours = 48 km.

Therefore, the total distance traveled was 30 km + 48 km = 78 km.

The average speed is calculated as follows:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 78 km / (6 hours + 12 hours)
Average speed = 78 km / 18 hours
Average speed = 4.33 km/h

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the distance traveled by ant A until meeting ant B, we can use the formula:
distance = speed x time
Ant A will take longer to reach ant B because it is moving slower. Let's assume that it takes ant A t hours to meet ant B.
So, the distance traveled by ant A is 9t cm. Similarly, the distance traveled by ant B is 6t cm.
Since the farms are 75 cm apart, we can set up the equation:
9t + 6t = 75
Simplifying this equation, we get:
15t = 75
t = 5
Substituting this value of t into the equations for the distances traveled by ant A and ant B, we get:
distance traveled by ant A = 9(5) = 45 cm
distance traveled by ant B = 6(5) = 30 cm
Therefore, the answer is (A).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can represent the times when the bells ring as follows:

- Bell 1: t = 36s
- Bell 2: t = 40s
- Bell 3: t = 48s

The first time all three bells ring together is when their times are equal. We can set up an equation to find this time:

t_1 = t_2 + t_3

Substituting in the values we know, we get:

36s = 40s + 48s

Simplifying, we get:

t_1 = 84s

So the first time all three bells ring together is after 84 seconds.

However, since each bell rings every 36, 40, and 48 seconds, respectively, we need to add these times together to find the total time between each ringing of all three bells:

total time = 36s + 40s + 48s = 124s

Therefore, the next time all three bells ring together will be after 124 seconds.

Comparing this with the answer choices, we see that option (B) After 12 minutes is closest to 124 seconds. However, since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we need to convert 12 minutes to seconds:

12 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 720 seconds

Since 720 > 124, we can say that the next time all three bells ring together will be after 720 seconds, which is equivalent to 12 minutes and 40 seconds.

Therefore, the answer is (B).
Therefore, the answer is

(B). After 12 minutes.

The total distance traveled by the plane is equal to the length of one side of the square multiplied by the number of sides. Since all sides of the square are the same length, we can use any side as our reference point.
Let's say the length of one side of the square is x km. Then the total distance traveled by the plane is:
4x km
The total time taken for the plane to fly around the square is also equal to the total distance divided by the speed it traveled on each side:
time = distance / speed
time = 4x / (200 + 400 + 600 + 800)
time = 4x / 2000
time = x/500
Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is:
average speed = total distance / total time
average speed = 4x / (4x / 500)
average speed = 500 km/hr
So the answer is (E).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(E). 452.

Question:Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use algebraic equations to solve this problem. Let J be the number of toys made by Jacob, then we know that:

J + A = 35 (since they both made 35 toys in total)

where A is the number of toys made by Alex.

We also know that Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so he made:

A = 7J

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

7J + J = 35

Simplifying, we get:

8J = 35

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

J = 4.375

Since we cannot have a fraction of a toy, we round down to 4.

Therefore, Jacob made 16 toys during the month. The answer is (B).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(B). 16.

Question:A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use trigonometry to solve this problem. Let's call the distance between the car and the base of the tower x. We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, so we can say that tan(45° - 60°) = x / d, where d is the distance between the car and the base of the tower.
Solving for d, we get:
d = x / tan(15°)
Now, let's assume that the car reaches the base of the tower after t minutes. At this point, the angle of elevation will be 90°, since the car is directly above the base of the tower. Using similar triangles, we can say that:
tan(90° - 45°) = x / t
Simplifying this equation, we get:
x / t = tan(45°)
t = x / tan(45°)
Substituting d = x / tan(15°), we get:
t = x / tan(15°) * tan(45°)
t = x / tan(15°) * 1
t = x / tan(15°)
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after x / tan(15°) minutes. Since we don't have the value of x, we cannot determine exactly how long it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower. However, we can eliminate some of the answer choices based on the given information.
Option (A): If the car reaches the base of the tower after 5 (√3 + 1) minutes, then x / tan(15°) = 5 (√3 + 1). Solving for x, we get:
x = 5 tan(15°) * (√3 + 1)
x ≈ 5.78
Since x is an approximate value, we cannot conclude that option (A) is the correct answer.
Option (B): If the car reaches the base of the tower after 6 (√3 + √2) minutes, then x / tan(15°) = 6 (√3 + √2). Solving for x, we get:
x = 6 tan(15°) * (√3 + √2)
x ≈ 6.92
Since x is an approximate value, we cannot conclude that option (B) is the correct answer.
Option (C): If the car reaches the base of the tower after 7 (√3 – 1) minutes, then x / tan(15°) = 7 (√3 – 1). Solving for x, we get:
x = 7 tan(15°) * (√3 – 1)
x ≈ 6.48
Since x is an approximate value, we cannot conclude that option (C) is the correct answer.
Option (D): If the car reaches the base of the tower after 8 (√3 – 2) minutes, then x / tan(15°) = 8 (√3 – 2). Solving for x, we get:
x = 8 tan(15°) * (√3 – 2)
x ≈ 7.28
Since x is an approximate value, we cannot conclude that option (D) is the correct answer.
Therefore, the only remaining option is (E) None of these. This means that the car may or may not reach the base of the tower within the given time frame, depending on the value of x.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(E) None of these.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how long it takes Mr. Sam to travel each way by train and then subtract the time he loses by going both ways by train.
Let's call the time it takes Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city "x" hours, and the time it takes him to travel back by train "y" hours.
From the given information, we know that:
x + y = 17 (time spent traveling by train one way)
x - y = 4 (time lost by going both ways by train)
Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
2x = 21
x = 10.5
So, it takes Mr. Sam 10.5 hours to travel to the city by train.
Now, let's calculate the time it takes him to travel back by train:
y = 17 - x = 17 - 10.5 = 6.5
And finally, let's calculate the total time it takes Mr. Sam to travel by car both ways:
Total time = 2 * (x + y) = 2 * (10.5 + 6.5) = 23
Therefore, the answer is (A) 22 hours.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We are given that the space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds and it takes 5 seconds to pass a point. We need to find the length of the space shuttle.
First, we can calculate the average speed of the space shuttle by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took:
Average speed = distance / time = 700m / 40s = 17.5m/s
Next, we can use the formula for displacement:
Displacement = Average speed * time
Substituting the values we know, we get:
Displacement = 17.5m/s * 5s = 87.5m
Finally, we can add the height at which the space shuttle was traveling to the displacement to find the total length of the space shuttle:
Total length = height + displacement = 700m + 87.5m = 787.5m
Therefore, the answer is (E) 150 m.
Therefore, the answer is

(E) 150 m.

Question:Train A leaves a station every 16 minutes and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again? Answer Choices: (A) 272 minutes (B) 304 minutes (C) 190 minutes (D) 70 minutes (E) 35 minutes
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula for the time it takes for two trains to meet at some point on their respective schedules:

time = (distance between stations) / (speed of faster train - speed of slower train)

Let's assume that Train A is going at a constant speed of x miles per hour and Train B is going at a constant speed of y miles per hour.

Since Train A leaves the station every 16 minutes and Train B leaves the station every 17 minutes, we can calculate the distance between them as follows:

distance = (x * 16) + (y * 17)

Now we need to find the speed difference between the two trains. Since Train A is leaving more frequently than Train B, we can say that Train A is going faster than Train B. Therefore, the speed difference is:

speed difference = x - y

Finally, we can substitute these values into our formula to find the time it takes for the two trains to meet again:

time = (distance between stations) / (speed difference)

Substituting in our values, we get:

time = ((x * 16) + (y * 17)) / (x - y)

We don't know the values of x and y yet, but we can make some observations based on the given choices:

- Choice (A): 272 minutes seems like a very long time for the trains to meet again. It would take approximately 18 hours and 40 minutes, which is much longer than the total time they spend on the tracks.
- Choice (B): 304 minutes also seems like a long time for the trains to meet again. It would take approximately 5 hours and 24 minutes, which is still much longer than the total time they spend on the tracks.
- Choice (C): 190 minutes is approximately 3 hours and 10 minutes, which is about half the time it would take for the trains to meet again if they were going at equal speeds.
- Choice (D): 70 minutes is approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes, which is much shorter than the time it would take for the trains to meet again if they were going at equal speeds.
- Choice (E): 35 minutes is much too short for the trains to meet again. It would only take a few minutes for one of the trains to catch up with the other.

Therefore, the correct answer must be either (C) 190 minutes or (D) 70 minutes. We can eliminate choice (E) because it is much too short. Now let's consider the other choices:

Choice (A): If Train A is going at a constant speed of x miles per hour and Train B is going at a constant speed of y miles per hour, then Train A will leave the station every 16 minutes and travel a distance of (x * 16) miles in that time. Similarly, Train B will leave the station every 17 minutes and travel a distance of (y * 17) miles in that time. However, we don't know the actual values of x and y yet, so we cannot determine whether Train A or Train B is going faster. Therefore, we cannot use this choice to determine the time it takes for the trains to meet again.

Choice (B): If Train A is going at a constant speed of x miles per hour and Train B is going at a constant speed of y miles per hour, then Train A will leave the station every 16 minutes and travel a distance of (x * 16) miles in that time. Similarly, Train B will leave the station every 17 minutes and travel a distance of (y * 17) miles in that time. However, we don't know the actual values of x and y yet, so we cannot determine whether Train A or Train B is going faster. Therefore, we cannot use this choice to determine the time it takes for the trains to meet again.

Choice (C): If Train A is going at a constant speed of x miles per hour and Train B is going at a constant speed of y miles per hour, then Train A will leave the station every 16 minutes and travel a distance of (x * 16) miles in that time. Similarly, Train B will leave the station every 17 minutes and travel a distance of (y * 17) miles in that time. However, we don't know the actual values of x and y yet, so we cannot determine whether Train A or Train B is going faster. Therefore, we cannot use this choice to determine the time it takes for the trains to meet again.

Choice (D): If Train A is going at a constant speed of x miles per hour and Train B is going at a constant speed of y miles per hour, then Train A will leave the station every 16 minutes and travel a distance of (x * 16) miles in that time. Similarly, Train B will leave the station every 17 minutes and travel a distance of (y * 17) miles in that time. However, we don't know the actual values of x and y yet, so we cannot determine whether Train A or Train B is going faster. Therefore, we cannot use this choice to determine the time it takes for the trains to meet again.

Choice (E): If Train A is going at a constant speed of x miles per hour and Train B is going at a constant speed of y miles per hour, then Train A will leave the station every 16 minutes and travel a distance of (x * 16) miles in that time.

However, we don't know the actual values of x and y yet, so we cannot determine whether Train A or Train B is going faster. Therefore, we cannot use this choice to determine the time it takes for the trains to meet again.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula d = r * theta where d is the distance traveled, r is the radius of the fan blade, and theta is the angle swept out by the fan blade in one revolution.
First, we need to find the radius of the fan blade. We know that the fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, so the radius of the fan blade is half of that distance, or 5 centimeters.
Next, we need to convert the number of revolutions per minute to radians per second. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so there are also 60 * 2 pi radians in a minute. Therefore, 300 revolutions per minute is equal to 300 * (2 pi / 60) radians per second, or 10 pi radians per second.
Finally, we can plug in our values into the formula d = r * theta and solve for d:
d = 5 cm * 10 pi rad/s
d = 50 pi cm

Therefore, the answer is (E) 7500pi.
Therefore, the answer is

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can calculate the total amount earned during the first 7 days by multiplying the average wage of $87 per day by the number of days worked, which is 7.
Total earnings from the first 7 days = $87/day x 7 days = $609
Similarly, we can calculate the total amount earned during the last 7 days by multiplying the average wage of $92 per day by the number of days worked, which is also 7.
Total earnings from the last 7 days = $92/day x 7 days = $644
The total amount earned during the entire fortnight is then the sum of the total earnings from the first 7 days and the total earnings from the last 7 days.
Total earnings = Total earnings from the first 7 days + Total earnings from the last 7 days = $609 + $644 = $1253
Since there are 15 consecutive working days in the fortnight, the worker was paid for 8 days out of the 15 days.
Therefore, the wage on the 8th day can be calculated as follows:
Wage on the 8th day = Total earnings / Number of days worked = $1253 / 15 days = $83.67
However, since the wage cannot be a fraction, we can round it up to the nearest whole number.
Wage on the 8th day = $84

Therefore, the answer is (A).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula:

number of items = rate * time

where "rate" is the number of items produced per unit of time, and "time" is the amount of time elapsed.

For Machine A:
rate = 1 / 6
time = 0

So far, Machine A has produced 0 yo-yos in 0 minutes.

For Machine B:
rate = 1 / 9
time = 0

So far, Machine B has produced 0 yo-yos in 0 minutes.

To find the total time it takes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos, we need to add up the times it takes each machine to produce one yo-yo:

total time = time for Machine A + time for Machine B

Let's call this total time "t". We know that t = 10 / (rate for Machine A + rate for Machine B).

Substituting in the rates from above:

t = 10 / (1/6 + 1/9)

t = 10 / (5/18)

t = 36 minutes

We can calculate the probability of the man catching the first train on either the harbor or main line by multiplying the probability of catching the first train on the main line with the probability of catching the first train on the harbor line.
Probability of catching the first train on the main line = 1/10
Probability of catching the first train on the harbor line = 1/10
Probability of catching the first train = Probability of catching the first train on the main line * Probability of catching the first train on the harbor line
= 1/10 * 1/10
= 1/100
Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1/100, which corresponds to option (E).

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula:

Total time = (number of tasks * time per task) / total workers

where "total time" is the total number of days required to complete all tasks, "number of tasks" is the number of tasks that need to be completed, "time per task" is the time required to complete one task, and "total workers" is the total number of workers available.

In this case, we have:

Number of tasks = 3
Time per task Mr Brown = 6 days
Time per task Mr Black = 8 days
Time per task Mr Blue = 12 days

Total workers = 3 (Mr Brown, Mr Black, Mr Blue)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Total time = (3 * 6) / 3 = 18 days

However, since Mr Brown went on vacation after 8 days, we need to subtract the time he worked from the total time:

Total time = 18 - 8 = 10 days

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much area the cow can graze in one day by multiplying its grazing rate by the length of the rope. Then we can divide the total area of the field by the area that the cow can graze in one day to find out how many days it will take her to graze the entire field.
Area that the cow can graze in one day = 10 sq ft
Length of the rope = 14 feet
Total area of the field = 3600 sq ft
Area that the cow can graze in one day / Length of the rope = 10 sq ft / 14 feet = 0.7142857142857143 sq ft/day
Days to graze the entire field = Total area of the field / Area that the cow can graze in one day = 3600 sq ft / 0.7142857142857143 sq ft/day = 51 days

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find when the two trains will meet, we need to first determine their relative positions. Train A is traveling at a speed of 40 kmph and covers a distance of 360 km in 6 hours (since it takes 6 hours to travel from Mumbai Central to Lucknow). Therefore, train A's average speed is 60 kmph.
Train B is traveling at a speed of 72 kmph and covers a distance of 360 km in 5 hours (since it takes 5 hours to travel from Mumbai Central to Lucknow). Therefore, train B's average speed is 72 kmph.
Since both trains are traveling towards each other, their relative position can be represented as:

Distance traveled by Train A = Distance traveled by Train B

Therefore, we have:

40 km/h * 6 h = 72 km/h * t

where t is the time taken by Train B to cover the remaining distance.

Solving this equation, we get:

t = 2 hours

Therefore, the two trains will meet at 2 pm on the next day. The answer is (D).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to find out how much the astronaut weighs on Venus and then compare it to their weight on Earth.
First, let's find out how much the astronaut weighs on Venus. Since the astronaut's weight is inversely proportional to the planet's gravity, we can use the formula:
Weight on Venus = Weight on Earth / Gravity on Venus
We know that the weight of the astronaut on Earth is 211 pounds and the gravity on Venus is 8.87 m/s^2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
Weight on Venus = 211 / 8.87 = 23.64 pounds
Now that we know the weight of the astronaut on Venus, we can calculate what percentage of their weight on Earth it is:
Percentage = (Weight on Venus / Weight on Earth) * 100%
Plugging in our values, we get:
Percentage = (23.64 / 211) * 100% = 11.15%
Therefore, the answer is (E) 90%.

Question:A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour, so if he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, we can say that:

Profit per bag = 25% * Selling price
Profit per bag = 0.25 * 100
Profit per bag = 25

Since the grocer made $3,000 in profit, we can say that:

Number of bags sold = Profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = 3000 / 25
Number of bags sold = 120

Therefore, the correct answer is (A).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(A). 12

Question:The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To increase the price back to 100%, we need to add 100% - 30% = 70% to the original price.
So, the new price would be 100% / 70% = 1.4286 times the original price.
Therefore, the percentage increase required to bring the price back to 100% would be 142.86% - 100% = 42.86%.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Question:Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the given information to write down an equation that represents the total revenue as a function of the revenue from novels and biographies. Let R be the total revenue and let N be the revenue from novels. Then we have:

R = N + (1 - 0.34)(N)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

R = 1.66N

Now we want to find out how much revenue comes from the sale of biographies. We know that 1/3 of the remaining revenue comes from the sale of biographies, so we have:

0.33R = (1 - 0.34)(N)

Solving for N, we get:

N = 0.33R / (1 - 0.34) = 1.5R

Therefore, the revenue from the sale of novels is about 1.5 times the revenue from the sale of biographies.

So the answer is (B).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let W be the number of white sharpeners and B be the number of brown sharpeners.
From the problem, we know that:

W + B = 18 (total number of sharpeners)
W = B + 1 (cost difference between white and brown sharpeners)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

(B + 1) + B = 18
2B + 1 = 18
2B = 17
B = 8.5

Since B must be a whole number, there are actually 8 brown sharpeners.

Now we can use the second equation to find the number of white sharpeners:

W = B + 1
W = 8 + 1
W = 9

Therefore, Jack bought 9 brown sharpeners and 9 white sharpeners.

The answer is (B).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
We know that the selling price is Rs.360 and the profit is 20%. So we can substitute these values into the formula:
20% of 360 = 360 - Cost Price
0.2 x 360 = 360 - Cost Price
72 = 360 - Cost Price
Cost Price = 360 - 72

We are given that the monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We want to find out what should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500.
Let's call the monthly sales x. Then, we can write an equation for S as follows:
S = 500 + 0.05x
We know that S = $1500 when x = some value. So, we can substitute this value into the equation above and solve for x:
1500 = 500 + 0.05x
1000 = 0.05x

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to find out how much commission the salesperson earns for each sale and then multiply that by the number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000.
The commission rate is given as 10%, which means that the salesperson earns 10% of the total amount sold as commission. To calculate the commission earned for a single sale of $250, we can use the following formula:
Commission earned = Sale price * Commission rate
Plugging in the values, we get:
Commission earned = $250 * 10% = $25
So, for every sale of $250, the salesperson earns $25 in commission.
Now, we need to determine how many sales are required to reach a salary of at least $1000. The salary is given as $1000, so we can set up an equation:
Sales price * Number of sales >= $1000
Substituting the values we know, we get:
$250 * Number of sales >= $1000
Dividing both sides by $250, we get:
Number of sales >= 4
Therefore, the salesperson needs to sell at least 4 units of product to earn a salary of at least $1000. However, since the options only provide whole numbers, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
So, the answer is (D) 40.

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that 10% of the pens will be rejected, which means out of the total number of pens produced, there will be 7200 * 10 / 100 = 720 pens that will be rejected.

The remaining pens will be delivered to the wholesaler, which means there will be 7200 - 720 = 6480 pens delivered.

The profit estimate for the entire production is 25%, which means the profit per pen is 10 * 25 / 100 = 2.5.

Since the profit per pen is equal to the difference between the selling price and the manufacturing cost, we can calculate the manufacturing cost as follows:

Manufacturing cost = Selling price - Profit per pen

Manufacturing cost = 10 - 2.5

Manufacturing cost = 7.5

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the actual selling price of the article, we need to calculate the discounted price and then add the discount back to it.
The discounted price is given as:
Discounted price = Original price * Discount rate
So, the discounted price of the article would be:
Discounted price = 4578 * 0.20 = Rs.915.60
Now, we can add the discount back to the discounted price to get the actual selling price:
Actual selling price = Discounted price + Discount
Actual selling price = 915.60 + 915.60 = Rs.1831.20
Therefore, the answer is (E) s.4870.

Question:If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the given information to set up three equations:

- 75% = x + y
- 40% = x + z
- 20% = w

where x represents the number of employees who take only a winter vacation, y represents the number of employees who take only a summer vacation, z represents the number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation, and w represents the number of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

Solving for x in the first equation gives us:
x = 75% - y - z
Substituting this into the second equation gives us:
40% = 75% - y - z + z
Multiplying both sides by 100% gives us:
400% = 75% - y - z + z * 100%

Subtracting 400% from both sides gives us:
-300% = -y - z
Dividing both sides by -300% gives us:
y + z = 100%

Since we know that x = 75% - y - z and z = 100%, we can substitute these values into the third equation to get:
x + y + z = 75% - y - z + z
x + y + z = 75% - y + 100%
x + y + z = 175% - y
Subtracting z from both sides gives us:
x + y = 85%

Finally, we can substitute this value of x + y into the expression for y in the second equation to get:
40% = 75% - (x + y) - z
40% = 75% - 85% - z
z = 15%

Therefore, the correct answer is (B). 15% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
Therefore, the answer is

(B) 15%.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to find out how much the shopkeeper made from selling the items at a discount and then calculate the percentage increase required to sell them at their original price.
Let's assume that the shopkeeper sold x items at a discount of 20%. The total amount of money he made from these sales would be:
x * 80% = 0.8x
Now, let's say that the shopkeeper needs to sell these same items at their original price. If he sells each item for its original price, he will make:
x * 100% = x
The difference between the two amounts is:
0.8x - x = 0.2x
Since the shopkeeper needs to make up for the loss of 20%, he needs to increase the price of each item by 20% to make up for the lost profit. Therefore, the percentage increase required to sell the items at their original price is:
20% / 100% = 0.2
So the correct answer is (E) 18%.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to add an equal amount of sand to the clay in the mixture.
Let's say we want to remove x kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. Then, the new weight of the mixture would be:
10 - x + x = 10
x = 0

Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula for the arithmetic mean of a set of numbers, which is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of numbers. In this case, the sum of the weights of the 10 vehicles is 122 tons and there are 10 vehicles, so the average weight is 12.2 tons.
To find the weight of the heavy duty truck, we need to add its weight to the sum of the weights of the other 9 vehicles. If the average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after the heavy duty truck was added, then the total weight of the group of vehicles before the addition of the heavy duty truck was 122 - 2.6 = 119.4 tons.
Since there were 10 vehicles in the group before the addition of the heavy duty truck, the weight of each vehicle in the group before the addition of the heavy duty truck was 119.4 / 10 = 11.94 tons. Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck must be greater than or equal to 11.94 tons.
Looking at the answer choices, only option (A) has a weight greater than or equal to 11.94 tons, so that must be the correct answer.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture of alloys X and Y. We can do this by multiplying the mass of each alloy by its corresponding ratio.
For alloy X:
Zinc = 6 * 40 grams = 240 grams Copper = 9 * 40 grams = 360 grams Total mass = 240 + 360 = 600 grams For alloy Y:
Zinc = 7 * 60 grams = 420 grams Copper = 11 * 60 grams = 660 grams Total mass = 420 + 660 = 1080 grams To find the total mass of zinc and copper in the mixture of alloys X and Y, we add the masses of zinc and copper from each alloy:
Total mass = 240 grams + 360 grams + 420 grams + 660 grams = 1680 grams Now we can find the ratio of zinc and copper in the mixture of alloys X and Y by dividing the mass of each metal by the total mass:
Zinc ratio = 240 grams / 1680 grams = 0.1428 Zinc percentage = 0.1428 * 100% = 14.28% Copper ratio = 360 grams / 1680 grams = 0.2143 Copper percentage = 0.2143 * 100% = 21.43%
So the ratio of zinc and copper in the mixture of alloys X and Y is approximately 14.28% zinc to 21.43% copper.
Therefore, the answer is (E).

We know that this number represents the percentage of deer in the population with tags in 2002, so we can set up an equation: $\frac{480}{500} = p$ where $p$ is the proportion of deer in the population with tags in 2002. Solving for $p$, we get $p=0.96$. Since there were 300 deer tagged in 2001, we can multiply this number by the proportion of deer with tags in 2002 to find the total number of deer with tags in the population: $300 \cdot 0.96 = 288$. Since the total deer population is the sum of all deer with tags in the population and those without tags, we can set up another equation: $300 + 288 = N$ where $N$ is the total deer population. Solving for $N$, we get $N=600$. Therefore, the answer is (D).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(D). 600.

Question:Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 60 (C) 28 (D) 26 (E) 18
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use algebraic equations to solve this problem. Let's say that John had x amount of money. Then we know that:

- Mark gets half of John's money, which means he gets x/2.
- John gets one-third of Mark's money, which means he gets x/3.

From these two equations, we can form a system of linear equations:

x/2 + x/3 = 75

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x(5/6) = 75

Multiplying both sides by 6/5, we get:

x = 90

Therefore, John had Rs.90 in his account.

Question:In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the given information to set up an equation. Let V be the number of vanilla flavored chocolates, and S be the number of squashed chocolates. Then we have:

V + S = 100 (since there are 100 total chocolates)

S = 90V (since 90% of the remaining chocolates are squashed)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

V + 90V = 100

101V = 100

V = 1

So there is only one vanilla flavored chocolate in the store.

Now we need to find out how many squashed chocolates there are. Using the second equation again, we get:

S = 90(1 - V) = 90(1 - 1) = 0

This means that all the squashed chocolates are also vanilla flavored.

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 100%. The answer is (E).
Therefore, the answer is

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the ratio of trousers and shirts, we need to divide the total amount spent on trousers by the total amount spent on shirts.
Total amount spent on trousers = 810
Total amount spent on shirts = 810 - 70 * 30 = 810 - 2100 = -1290 (This is a negative number because the man spent more on shirts than he had budgeted for.)

Question:A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To calculate the maximum simple interest rate that the merchant can afford to borrow money at, we need to use the following formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal x Rate x Time) / 100

where Principal is the amount borrowed, Rate is the simple interest rate, and Time is the time period over which the loan is repaid.

In this case, the merchant has received an invoice for $20,000 with terms 4/30, n/100. This means that the merchant has 4 months to pay off the invoice, and if they fail to do so, they will be charged a late fee of 10% per month until the invoice is paid in full.

We can use the terms of the invoice to calculate the time period over which the loan is repaid:

Time = 4 months + 1 month * (n - 4)

Substituting this into the formula above, we get:

Simple Interest = ($20,000 x Rate x (4 months + 1 month * (n - 4))) / 100

Since the merchant wants to take advantage of the discount offered on the invoice, they want to pay it off as soon as possible. Therefore, we can assume that the merchant will pay off the invoice within the first 4 months.

Substituting this into the formula above, we get:

Simple Interest = ($20,000 x Rate x 4 months) / 100

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Simple Interest = $8,000

Now we need to find the maximum simple interest rate that the merchant can afford to borrow money at. We know that the merchant cannot afford to pay more than $8,000 in simple interest over the course of 4 months, so we can set up the following equation:

$8,000 <= Simple Interest

Rearranging this equation, we get:

Rate <= $8,000 / ($20,000 x 4 months)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Rate <= 10%

Therefore, the maximum simple interest rate that the merchant can afford to borrow money at is 10%. The correct answer is (E).
Therefore, the answer is

(E) None of these.

Question:Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to use the definition of median income. The median income is the middle value when all incomes in a group are arranged in order from lowest to highest.
Since the median income is $3000, it means that half of the family members earn more than $3000 and half earn less than $3000.
Let's assume that there are n members in the family. Then, the sum of their incomes would be $9000. We can write an equation:
n * income_per_person = $9000
where income_per_person is the average income of the family members.
Since the median income is $3000, we know that the sum of the incomes of the top half of the family members is at least $3000. Let's call the sum of these incomes X. Then, we have:
X + Y >= $3000
where Y is the sum of the incomes of the bottom half of the family members.
Since the sum of all incomes is $9000, we can substitute this into the first equation:
n * income_per_person = $9000
income_per_person = $9000 / n
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
X + Y >= $3000
X + (Y - $3000) >= $3000
X >= $3000 - Y
X >= $3000 - ($9000 / n)
X >= $3000 - $3000 / n
X >= $3000 / n
Therefore, we have:
n * $3000 / n >= $3000
This simplifies to:
$3000 >= $3000
which is true for any value of n.
However, since the median income cannot be greater than the total income, we must have:
n * $3000 <= $9000
Solving for n, we get:
n <= $9000 / $3000
n <= 3
Therefore, there must be at most 3 members in the family. However, since the median income is only $3000, it is unlikely that there are 3 members in the family. It is more likely that there are 2 or fewer members in the family. Therefore, the answer choice (A) 2 is the most likely correct answer.
Therefore, the answer is

(A) 2.

Question:Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We are given that the population of Boomtown increased by 10% each year for the past two years. This means that the population at the end of the first year was 100% + 10% = 110% of what it was at the beginning of the year. Similarly, the population at the end of the second year was 110% * 110% = 121% of what it was at the beginning of the year.
Therefore, the population of Boomtown at the beginning of the second year was 100% / 121% = 82.35%. Since we want to find the percent population increase over the last year, we need to subtract this value from the population at the beginning of the first year.
So, the percent population increase over the last year would be:
(110% - 82.35%) / 82.35% = 27.65%
Therefore, the answer is (A).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula:

    Marks obtained = Maximum marks * (Marks obtained / Maximum marks)

Substituting the given values, we get:

    504 = M * (504 / M)
    
Simplifying this equation, we get:

    M^2 - 504M + 25200 = 0
    
Using the quadratic formula, we find that:

    M = (504 ± sqrt(504^2 - 4*25200)) / 2
    
Simplifying this expression, we get:

    M = (504 ± sqrt(108960 - 100800)) / 2
    
M = (504 ± sqrt(-12960)) / 2
    
Since the square root of a negative number is undefined, there are no real solutions for M.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 960.

Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^nt where A is the final amount, P is the initial amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times per year the interest is compounded, and t is the time in years.

In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 0.08 (annual interest rate), n = 2 (compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 (one year). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^2*1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$54,080 = P*(1.04)^2

Dividing both sides by $(1.04)^2$, we get:

P = $54,080 / (1.04)^2

Using a calculator, we find that:

P = $50,000

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).

Question:You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to identify what each item costs in terms of cents. One soda costs 75 cents and two energy bars cost 120 cents. 

Next, we can use these values to set up a system of equations to solve for the price of each item. We have:

x + y = 150 (where x is the price of one soda and y is the price of two energy bars)
2x + 3y = 300 (where x is the price of two sodas and y is the price of three energy bars)

To solve this system, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate y:

2x + 2y = 300

Then, we can subtract the second equation from the first:

x = 150 - 300/2
x = 75

Now that we know the price of one soda is 75 cents, we can substitute that value into either of the original equations to find the price of two energy bars:

y = 150 - 75
y = 75

Therefore, the price of one soda is 75 cents and the price of two energy bars is also 75 cents.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
The price of one soda is 75 cents and the price of two energy bars is also 75 cents.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We are given that $x = m\% \cdot 4y$. To find what percentage of $x$ $m$ is, we need to divide $m$ by $x$. Dividing both sides by $4y$, we get:

$$\frac{m}{x} = \frac{m}{(m\% \cdot 4y)} = \frac{1}{4m\%}$$

Since $m > 0$ and $y > 0$, we know that $m\% > 0$ and $4y > 0$. Therefore, $\frac{1}{4m\%}$ is a positive number, and we can write it as:

$$\frac{1}{4m\%} = \frac{2500}{m}$$

Therefore, the answer is (E).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the formula for simple interest:

Simple Interest = (Principal x Rate x Time) / 100

And for compound interest:

Compound Interest = Principal x [(1 + Rate)^Time - 1] / Rate

We know that the difference between simple interest and compound interest for a given principal, rate, and time is equal to the amount of money invested in simple interest. So we can write:

CI - SI = Principal x [Rate x Time] / 100

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

72 - SI = 5000 x [(72/100) x 2] / 100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

SI = 36

Now we need to find the rate of interest. We can rearrange the above equation to solve for it:

SI = Principal x Rate x Time / 100
36 = 5000 x Rate x 2 / 100
36 = 100 x Rate
Rate = 36 / 100 = 3%

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that if one root of a quadratic equation is 1.5, then the other root must be equal to the negative reciprocal of the first root, which is -1.5.
So we can substitute -1.5 for x in the original equation:
x^2 + mx + 22 = 0
(-1.5)^2 + (-1.5)m + 22 = 0

Simplifying this equation gives us:
2.25 - 1.5m + 22 = 0
-1.5m = -20.75
m = 14

Therefore, the answer is (E) Cannot be determined. While it is possible that one of the roots could be slightly less than 1.5 or slightly greater than 1.5, we cannot determine the exact value of m based on the given information.

Question:The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that the area of a trapezium is given by A = h * (b1 + b2), where h is the height and b1 and b2 are the parallel sides.
Let's call the height of the canal "h". We also know that the width of the canal at the top is "b1" = 10 m and the width of the canal at the bottom is "b2" = 6 m.
Substituting these values into the formula for the area of a trapezium, we get:
A = h * (10 + 6)
Simplifying this expression, we get:
A = h * 16
We know that the area of the canal is 640 square meters, so we can set up the equation:
640 = h * 16
Solving for "h", we get:
h = 40

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 40 meters.

The answer is (C).
Therefore, the answer is

Question:A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can calculate the total number of faces that are painted by first calculating the total number of faces in the large cube and then subtracting the number of faces that are painted on each face of the large cube.

The total number of faces in a hollow cube of size 5cm is:

6 faces (top/bottom), 6 faces (front/back), 6 faces (left/right)

Since the thickness of the cube is 1cm, we need to add one more face for each side:

6 faces + 2 faces = 8 faces

Therefore, the total number of faces in the large cube is 8 faces.

Now, let's calculate the number of faces that are painted on each face of the large cube:

There are 8 faces, so if we paint each face, we will have painted a total of 8 faces * 1 face/painted face = 8 faces.

However, since the large cube has an inner surface as well, we need to subtract the number of faces that are painted on the inner surface from this total:

8 faces - 6 faces (inner surface) = 2 faces

Therefore, only 2 faces of the larger cube are painted.

Finally, let's calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted:

There are 5 smaller cubes, each with 6 faces, so there are a total of 5 cubes * 6 faces/cube = 30 faces.

Since only 2 faces of the larger cube are painted, the remaining 30 faces are all unpainted.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 498.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(E) 498.

Question:When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let’s say that the length of the rectangle is x cm, and the width is y cm.
According to the problem, when the rectangle is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 48 cm. This means that:

2x + 2y = 48

When the rectangle is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is 66 cm. This means that:

2x + 2y = 66

Since these two equations are the same, we can set them equal to each other:

2x + 2y = 48 = 2(2x + 2y)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 2y = 48

Subtracting 2y from both sides, we get:

2x = 48 - 2y

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 24 - y

Now we know that x = 24 - y, so we can substitute this expression for x in either of the original equations to solve for y.

For example, if we use the first equation:

2x + 2y = 48

Substituting x = 24 - y, we get:

2(24 - y) + 2y = 48

Simplifying this equation, we get:

48 - 2y + 2y = 48

So the equation holds true for any value of y.

Using the second equation:

2x + 2y = 66

Substituting x = 24 - y, we get:

2(24 - y) + 2y = 66

Simplifying this equation, we get:

48 - 2y + 2y = 66

So the equation also holds true for any value of y.

Therefore, the rectangle has a length of 24 cm and a width of y cm, where y can be any positive integer. The area of the rectangle is:

A = length x width
A = 24 cm x y cm
A = 24y cm^2

We don't have enough information to determine the exact value of y, but we do know that the area of the rectangle is A = 24y cm^2. Therefore, the answer is option (E).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(E) 1200.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that U is the midpoint of line segment ST, so we can use the fact that the midpoint of a line segment divides it into two equal parts. Therefore, the length of RU must be half the length of ST.
To find the length of ST, we can add up the lengths of RS and RT: ST = RS + RT = 5 + 17 = 22
Since U is the midpoint of ST, RU = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11
Therefore, the answer is (E).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let the breadth of the rectangle be x.
The length of the rectangle is 4x + 1.
The area of the rectangle is x(4x + 1).
Since the area is 150 sq m, we can write:
x(4x + 1) = 150
4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = [(-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))]/(2a)
where a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150.
Substituting these values, we get:
x = [-1 ± sqrt((1)^2 - 4*4*(-150))]/(2*4)
x = [-1 ± sqrt(601)]/(8)
Since the length cannot be negative, we take the positive value of x:
x = [-1 + sqrt(601)]/(8)
x ≈ 7.29 m
Therefore, the breadth of the rectangle is approximately 7.29 m.
The perimeter of the rectangle is:
P = 2(l + b)
= 2(4x + 1 + 7.29)
= 2(11.29)
= 22.58 m
Therefore, the answer is (E).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(E). 64 m.

Question:A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can represent the problem as a system of equations:
x + y + z = 37 (length of painted sides)
y + z = 9 (unpainted side)

From the second equation, we know that y + z = 9. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

x + 9 + z = 37

Simplifying, we get:

x + z = 28

Now we need to find the value of x. We can do this by using one of the given answer choices as an initial guess. Let's choose A) 46 for x.

If x = 46, then:

z = 28 - x = 28 - 46 = -18

This doesn't make sense because the length of the unpainted side cannot be negative. Therefore, our initial guess was incorrect. 

Let's try another answer choice: C) 126.

If x = 126, then:

z = 28 - x = 28 - 126 = -98

Again, this doesn't make sense because the length of the unpainted side cannot be negative. Therefore, our initial guess was also incorrect.

Let's try another answer choice: E) None.

If x = None, then the only possible solution is z = 0. However, this means that all three sides are painted, which contradicts the fact that there is an unpainted side. Therefore, our initial guess was also incorrect.

Since none of the given answer choices work, we need to use a different approach. One way to solve this problem is to use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = length x width

The length of the painted side is 37 feet, so we can substitute this into the formula:

Area = 37 x width

We don't know the width of the rectangle yet, but we can use the fact that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet to relate it to the other dimensions. Since the length of the unpainted side is equal to the difference between the sum of the lengths of the painted sides and the length of the entire rectangle, we can write:

width = 37 - (x + y)

Substituting this into the formula for the area, we get:

Area = 37 x (37 - (x + y))

Simplifying, we get:

Area = 37^2 - (x + y)^2

We want to minimize the area of the rectangle, so we need to minimize the expression inside the parentheses. This can be done by setting the derivative of the expression with respect to x and y equal to zero:

d/dx(37^2 - (x + y)^2) = 0
d/dy(37^2 - (x + y)^2) = 0

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 18
y = 29

Substituting these values into the expression for the area, we get:

Area = 37^2 - (18 + 29)^2 = 46

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 46 square feet. The correct answer is (A).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(A) 46.

Question:The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that the volume of a sphere is given by 4/3 * pi * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
The volume of a cube is given by s^3, where s is the side length of the cube.
To find the ratio of the volumes of the cube and the sphere, we need to compare their respective volumes.
Let's assume that the side length of the cube is s and the radius of the sphere is r.
Then, the volume of the cube is s^3 and the volume of the sphere is 4/3 * pi * r^3.
Dividing both sides of this equation by s^3, we get:
4/3 * pi * r^3 / s^3 = 4/3 * pi * r^3 / (s^3 * s^3)
Simplifying this expression, we get:
r^3 / s^3 = 1 / (4/3 * pi)
r^3 / s^3 = 3 / (4 * pi)
r^3 = 3 / (4 * pi) * s^3
r = sqrt[3/(4*pi)*s^3]
Now, let's assume that the sphere fits completely inside the cube.
In other words, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.
So, r = s.
Substituting this value in the equation above, we get:
sqrt[3/(4*pi)*s^3] = s
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
s = sqrt[(3/(4*pi))*s^3]
Squaring both sides, we get:
s^2 = (3/(4*pi))*s^3
Multiplying both sides by 4*pi, we get:
4*pi*s^2 = 3*s^3
Dividing both sides by s^2, we get:
4*pi = 3
This is a contradiction since 4*pi cannot be equal to 3.
Therefore, there is no sphere that can fit completely inside the cube.
However, if we relax the condition that the sphere must fit completely inside the cube, then we can find a sphere whose volume is approximately equal to that of the cube.
For example, if we choose a sphere with a radius of 0.5 meters, then its volume is approximately equal to that of a cube with a side length of 1 meter.
So, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is approximately 1:2.
Therefore, the answer is (B).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(B). 7:2.
