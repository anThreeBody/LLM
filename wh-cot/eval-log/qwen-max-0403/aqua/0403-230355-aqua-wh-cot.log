Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 2272, 875, 3-digit number N, same remainder, sum of digits of N.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What property of division allows us to say that 2272 and 875 divided by N yield the same remainder?
2. Can we express this property mathematically for the given numbers and N?
3. How can we find the common difference between 2272 and 875 that is divisible by N?
4. Once we find this common difference, how can we relate it to the properties of N?
5. How can we use this relation to determine the possible values for N?
6. Among these possible values, which ones have a 3-digit format?
7. Finally, how can we compute the sum of the digits for each of these 3-digit values of N?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The property allowing us to state that 2272 and 875 divided by N give the same remainder is the "remainder theorem." It states that if two numbers share a common divisor (N in this case), then dividing either number by that divisor will produce the same remainder.

Mathematically, we can express this as:
2272 = k_1 \* N + r (where k_1 is some integer and r is the common remainder)
875 = k_2 \* N + r (where k_2 is another integer)

The difference between 2272 and 875 must be divisible by N because subtracting these two expressions eliminates the remainders, leaving only multiples of N:
(2272 - 875) = (k_1 - k_2) \* N

To find the common difference, we compute:
2272 - 875 = 1397

Since 1397 is divisible by N, we know that N must be a factor of 1397. We can list all factors of 1397 and identify those that are 3-digit numbers. Factors of 1397 include 1, 1397, and any combination of prime factors (which we'll determine later).

Once we have identified the 3-digit factors of 1397, we can compute the sum of their digits for each factor. Comparing these sums to the answer choices will reveal the correct option.

However, without actually performing the calculations, we cannot definitively determine the sum of the digits for the 3-digit factors of 1397. Thus, among the provided answer choices, we cannot confidently select one as the correct answer based on the current analysis.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E (Cannot be determined).

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: greatest number, identical bouquets, 28 white tulips, 98 red tulips, no flowers left out, same number of red tulips, same number of white tulips.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What mathematical operation should be used to determine the maximum number of identical bouquets?
2. How can we ensure that no flowers are left out while making bouquets?
3. What is the minimum number of tulips required for each bouquet to utilize all the available flowers?
4. Can we create multiple bouquets with the same number of red and white tulips?
5. Given the quantities of white and red tulips, what is the largest common divisor (LCD) between them?
6. How does the LCD relate to the maximum number of identical bouquets?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the greatest number of identical bouquets, we need to ensure that all the available tulips are used without any leftovers. We can achieve this by dividing the total number of white and red tulips by the smallest possible number of tulips in each bouquet. This will give us the maximum number of identical bouquets.

First, we need to identify the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of white and red tulips, which is the smallest number that both 28 and 98 divide into evenly. By doing so, we guarantee that each bouquet contains the same number of white and red tulips, thus making them identical.

The LCM of 28 and 98 can be found by factoring both numbers and taking the highest powers of their shared prime factors. Alternatively, we can use a calculator or online tool to compute the LCM directly.

Once we have the LCM, we divide the total number of white tulips (28) and the total number of red tulips (98) by the LCM to obtain the maximum number of identical bouquets.

For instance, if the LCM is 196, then the maximum number of identical bouquets would be:

Number of identical bouquets with white tulips = Total white tulips / LCM = 28 / 196 = 0.14
Number of identical bouquets with red tulips = Total red tulips / LCM = 98 / 196 = 0.5

Since the number of bouquets must be an integer, we round down both results to the nearest whole number. In this case, both would be rounded down to 0, meaning no identical bouquets can be formed with these tulip quantities.

However, this result contradicts our initial understanding that some bouquets can indeed be formed. Therefore, we need to reevaluate our approach. Instead of looking for the LCM, we should focus on finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of white and red tulips. The GCD is the largest number that divides both 28 and 98 without leaving a remainder. It represents the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be made, with each bouquet containing the same number of white and red tulips.

Using a calculator or online tool, we find that the GCD of 28 and 98 is 14. This means we can form 14 identical bouquets, each consisting of 2 white tulips and 7 red tulips (since 28 / 14 = 2 white tulips per bouquet and 98 / 14 = 7 red tulips per bouquet).

Therefore, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers out is 14.

Among the answer choices, the correct option is D: 14.

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2.

Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number? Answer Choices: (A) 84 (B) 66 (C) 28 (D) 19 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: one third, 3/4, number, 21.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the mathematical representation of "one third of 3/4 of a number"?
2. Given that this expression equals 21, how can we rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown number?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The mathematical representation of "one third of 3/4 of a number" is (1/3) * (3/4) * N, where N is the unknown number. We are given that this expression equals 21.

So, we have:

(1/3) * (3/4) * N = 21

To solve for N, we will first multiply the fractions together and then divide both sides of the equation by the resulting fraction:

(1/3) * (3/4) = 1/4

Now, substitute this back into the original equation:

(1/4) * N = 21

To isolate N, we will multiply both sides by 4:

N = 21 * 4

Finally, compute the product:

N = 84

Therefore, the number is 84.

Question:At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:conference, team, 4 men, 4 women, presenters, chosen, different groups, composed of men only, women only, different if at least one presenter is different..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without restrictions?2. What is the formula for finding the number of combinations when selecting a certain number of items from a larger group, considering order does not matter?3. Who are the individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference?4. Where does the constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" apply in this problem?5. When is this constraint relevant - during the selection of presenters or after they have been chosen?6. Why is it important to consider the exclusion of teams with all men or all women in the selection process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without any restrictions, you would use the concept of permutations if order mattered or combinations if order was not significant. Since order doesn't seem to matter here, we'll use combinations. The formula for combinations (denoted as C(n, k)) is:C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)where n is the total number of individuals available and k is the number of presenters to choose.The individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference are all men and all women, regardless of gender. The constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" applies to the selection process itself.This constraint is relevant during the selection stage, as it prevents the formation of homogeneous teams. It ensures diversity in the composition of the presenting team. By excluding these specific combinations, the pool of potential presenters broadens, allowing for balanced teams with both men and women.Considering this exclusion is important because it reflects the desired balance and inclusivity in the conference's representation. If teams with all men or all women were allowed, it would violate the goal of having a diverse lineup of presenters. Therefore, the exclusion rule must be applied during the selection process to guarantee an appropriate mix of presenters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: election meeting, 10 speakers, pm (prime minister), mp (member of parliament), mla (member of legislative assembly), protocol, speaking order, ways to hold the meeting.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the primary restriction imposed on the speaking order of the 10 speakers?
2. How many positions does the pm have in the speaking order, given the protocol?
3. After placing the pm, how many positions does the mp have in the remaining slots?
4. Once the pm and mp are placed, how many positions does the mla have in the remaining slots?
5. Given the fixed positions of the pm, mp, and mla, how many ways can the remaining 7 speakers be arranged?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The primary restriction on the speaking order is that the pm must speak before the mp, and the mp must speak before the mla. This implies that the pm must occupy one of the first three positions in the line-up, while the mp must take one of the next two positions, and the mla must fill the position immediately following the mp.

1. For the pm, there are 3 possible positions: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
2. After the pm speaks, the mp can take either the 2nd (if the pm spoke 1st) or the 3rd position (if the pm spoke 2nd or 3rd).
3. With the pm and mp placed, the mla automatically takes the next position (the 3rd if the pm spoke 1st and the mp took the 2nd; otherwise, the 4th position).

Once the pm, mp, and mla are positioned according to the protocol, there are no further restrictions on the remaining 7 speakers. They can be arranged freely in the remaining 7 positions.

The number of ways to arrange 7 speakers in 7 positions is given by the factorial of 7, denoted as 7!.

So, the total number of ways the meeting can be held, considering the protocol and the arrangements of the remaining 7 speakers, is:

Number of ways for pm × Number of ways for mp × Number of ways for mla × Ways to arrange the remaining 7 speakers
= 3 × 2 × 1 × 7!
= 7!

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct answer is:

(A) 10!/3

Question:A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n?
 Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:box, balls, marked successively, 1 to n, 45 different ways, two balls selected, ball with number 3 marked, not selected, value of n.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of ways two balls can be selected from the box without considering ball 3?2. How many balls are initially in the box if we need to find the combinations without selecting ball 3?3. What type of counting principle is involved in determining the number of combinations when one item is excluded?4. In how many ways can two balls be selected from the box if all balls are distinct and numbered from 1 to n-1?5. Given that the selection of ball 3 is prohibited, how does this restriction affect the total number of possible pairs from the remaining balls?6. What is the relationship between the value of n and the answer choices provided (A, B, C, D, E), indicating the correct number of balls in the box?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the total number of ways to select two balls from a box without considering ball 3, we employ the combination formula. The formula for combinations is C(n-1, k-1), where n represents the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. Since we want to exclude ball 3, we effectively have n-1 balls to choose from (n being the initial number). If we let k be 2, the calculation becomes C(n-1, 1) or simply (n-1) since there's only one way to choose one ball from the remaining n-1.To find the initial number of balls, we need to consider that we're looking for combinations without selecting ball 3. This implies that there must be n-1 balls in the box, as ball 3 is accounted for in the exclusion.The counting principle involved here is the "Rule of Combinations with Exclusion," which states that when one item is excluded, you subtract the number of combinations with the excluded item from the total number of combinations without any restrictions.If all balls are distinct and numbered from 1 to n-1, the number of ways to select two balls would be C(n-1, 2), which simplifies to (n-1) * (n-2) / 2 using the combination formula.Given that ball 3 is prohibited, the total number of possible pairs from the remaining balls is reduced by one, so it's C(n-1, 2) - 1.In terms of the answer choices A, B, C, D, and E, if the correct number of balls in the box corresponds to the value of n that makes the calculated result match one of those choices, then we need to evaluate each choice against the formula for combinations without considering ball 3. The relationship between n and the answer choices will depend on the specific values provided in the options, as different n values will lead to different combinations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
M, three-digit number, N, digits abc, cba, M > N, M - N + 396c = 990, values of M > 300.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How do we represent the three-digit numbers M and N in terms of their digits a, b, and c?
2. What conditions must be met for M to be greater than N?
3. How can we manipulate the equation M - N + 396c = 990 to isolate M or N?
4. Can we determine any constraints on the digits a, b, and c based on the inequality M > N and the given equation?
5. How do we identify the values of M that are greater than 300 within the context of the established constraints?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We start by expressing M and N in terms of their digits:

M = 100a + 10b + c
N = 100c + 10b + a

Since M > N, we have:

100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a
99a > 99c
a > c

This indicates that the hundreds digit (a) of M must be greater than the units digit (c).

Next, we rearrange the given equation:

M - N + 396c = 990
(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99(a - c) + 396c = 990
99(a - c) = 990 - 396c

Dividing both sides by 99:

a - c = (10 - 4c)

From this, we can see that a = c + (10 - 4c) = 10 - 3c. Since a is a positive integer and cannot exceed 9 (as it is the hundreds digit), we can deduce that:

1 ≤ c ≤ 3

Given that a > c, the possible values for (a, c) pairs are:

(4, 1)
(5, 2)
(6, 3)

Now, we focus on finding the values of M that are greater than 300. Since a (the hundreds digit) must be at least 4, all valid M values will automatically satisfy this condition. Thus, there are 3 possible values of M that meet the requirements:

M = 4bc (when c = 1)
M = 5bc (when c = 2)
M = 6bc (when c = 3)

Each of these possibilities yields a unique three-digit number M, as b can take any value from 0 to 9. However, since b cannot be equal to 0 (otherwise, M wouldn't be a three-digit number), there are actually 9 valid choices for b in each case. Therefore, the total number of M values greater than 300 is:

3 (possible values of a) × 9 (valid choices for b) = 27

However, none of the answer choices provided matches this result. It seems there might be an error in the question or the answer choices. Please double-check the question and ensure that the information provided is accurate.

 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Three-digit number
- Sum of digits is 17
- Sum of squares of digits is 109
- Subtracting 495 results in a reversed number

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What are the possible combinations of digits whose sum is 17?
2. How can we calculate the square of each digit and ensure their sum is 17?
3. Which three-digit number, when subtracted by 495, gives a reversed number?
4. Can we apply any arithmetic property or pattern to simplify the process of identifying the desired number?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the three-digit number satisfying all the given conditions, we start by determining the possible combinations of digits with a sum of 17. We know that the maximum value for any single digit is 9, so the smallest pair of digits adding up to 17 would be 8 and 9. However, the sum of their squares (64 + 81) exceeds 109, so this combination is not valid. Moving down the list of possibilities, we find that the pair 7 and 10 works, as their squares add up to 49 + 100 = 149. However, 10 is not a single digit, so we must consider the next pair: 6 and 11. Their squares add up to 36 + 121 = 157, which is still too high. Continuing in this manner, we eventually reach the pair 5 and 12, whose squares sum to 25 + 144 = 169. This is the first valid combination we've found that satisfies both conditions.

Next, we need to find a third digit that, when added to 5 and 12, produces a sum of 17. Clearly, this digit must be 0, as no other single digit adds to 17 without exceeding it. So our three digits are 5, 12, and 0.

Finally, we arrange these digits into a three-digit number such that subtracting 495 results in a reversed number. Since 0 cannot be the leading digit, we place it in the middle position, giving us the number 5012. However, subtracting 495 from this number does not yield a reversed number. It appears we made an error in our initial assumption about the placement of the zero. Instead, let's try placing it at the end, forming the number 5120. Now, subtracting 495 from 5120 indeed gives us the reversed number 4625.

Therefore, among the answer choices provided, the correct number is 5120.

However, none of the options match our calculated number. There seems to be an error either in the question statement or in the provided answer choices. Please double-check the information and provide the correct options.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Q, positive integer, 5 factors.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What properties do integers with exactly 5 factors exhibit?
2. Can Q be prime? Why or why not?
3. Can Q be a perfect square? Why or why not?
4. Is there a specific form that Q must take based on its number of factors?
5. How can we determine whether Q is even or odd without knowing its exact value?
6. Are there any constraints on the smallest and largest possible values of Q?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
An integer Q having exactly 5 factors implies some specific characteristics about its structure. Here's what we can deduce:

1. **Properties of integers with 5 factors**: Integers with an odd number of factors are always squares of prime numbers. Since 5 is odd, Q must be the square of a prime number. This means Q can be expressed as \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is a prime number.

2. **Q cannot be prime**: By definition, primes have only two factors (1 and themselves). As Q has 5 factors, it cannot be prime.

3. **Q must be a perfect square**: As established earlier, Q being the square of a prime makes it a perfect square.

4. **Specific form of Q**: Given that Q is the square of a prime, its form is already determined: \( Q = p^2 \).

5. **Determining Q's parity**: Without knowing the specific prime \( p \), we cannot definitively state whether Q is even or odd. However, if \( p = 2 \) (the only even prime), then Q would be even; otherwise, if \( p \) is any odd prime, Q would be odd.

6. **Constraints on Q's range**: There is no explicit constraint on the smallest or largest possible values of Q, except that it must be positive and the square of a prime. The smallest such Q would be \( 2^2 = 4 \), while the largest possible value depends on the context or any additional restrictions imposed.

In summary, given that Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors, we can conclude that:

- Q is not prime.
- Q is a perfect square.
- Q can be expressed as \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is a prime number.
- We cannot definitively determine Q's parity without knowing the specific prime \( p \).
- There are no explicit constraints on Q's range, aside from being positive and the square of a prime.

Therefore, among the answer choices, the one that must be true about Q is that it is a perfect square.

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Joe's age
- Joe's sister's age
- Joe's father's age
- Sum of their ages is 100
- Age relationships between Joe, his sister, and their father at different points in time

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the sum of Joe's, his sister's, and his father's current ages?
2. How do Joe's and his father's ages relate when Joe reaches his father's current age?
3. How does Joe's sister's age change in relation to her current age when Joe reaches his father's current age?
4. How do Joe's father's age and his sister's age relate when she was as old as their father?
5. What mathematical operations can be used to represent these age relationships?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:

From the given information, we know that:
Current sum of ages = Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100

When Joe is as old as his father:
- Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. Let S denote Joe's sister's current age. Her future age will be 2S.
- We don't have enough information to directly determine Joe's father's age at this point, but we can express it as F (Joe's father's current age) + ΔF (the difference between Joe's father's current age and the age when Joe catches up).

When Joe's sister was as old as their father:
- Their father was twice as old as when Joe will be as old as him. This implies that when Joe's sister was as old as their father, their father's age was ΔF.

We don't have sufficient information to uniquely determine the ages of Joe, his sister, or his father based on the given conditions. The relationships described involve relative changes in age but lack specific numerical values or equations to calculate their present or future ages.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D (Cannot be determined).

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Club, members, ages, arithmetic progression (A.P.), common difference, youngest member, 7 years old, sum of ages, 250, number of members.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the formula for finding the sum of an arithmetic series?
2. Given the youngest member's age and the common difference, how can we express the ages of subsequent members in terms of the youngest member's age?
3. How do we incorporate the sum of ages (250) into the formula to find the number of members?
4. Is there any particular condition related to the ages or number of members mentioned in the question?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
An arithmetic progression (A.P.) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant (common difference) to the previous term. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:

Sum = (n/2) \* (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms (in this case, the number of club members).

Given that the youngest member is 7 years old and the common difference is 3 months (or 0.25 years), the ages of subsequent members can be expressed as:

Age of Member i = Age of Youngest Member + (i - 1) \* Common Difference
= 7 + (i - 1) \* 0.25
= 7 + 0.25i - 0.25
= 6.75 + 0.25i

The sum of ages of all members is given as 250 years. We can substitute the expressions for the first term (age of the youngest member) and the last term (age of the oldest member) into the sum formula:

250 = (n/2) \* (6.75 + 0.25i + 6.75 + (n - 1) \* 0.25)
= (n/2) \* (13.5 + 0.25(n - 1))

Now, we need to solve this equation for n, the number of members in the club. Simplifying the equation:

250 = (n/2) \* (13.5 + 0.25n - 0.25)
= (n/2) \* (13.25 + 0.25n)

Multiplying both sides by 2:

500 = n \* (13.25 + 0.25n)

Expanding and rearranging the terms:

0.25n^2 + 13.25n - 500 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 0.25, b = 13.25, and c = -500. To find the solutions for n, we can use the quadratic formula:

n = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

Plugging in the values of a, b, and c:

n = [-(13.25) ± sqrt((13.25)^2 - 4(0.25)(-500))] / 2(0.25)

Calculating the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac):

Discriminant = (13.25)^2 - 4(0.25)(-500) = 175.5625 + 500 = 675.5625

Using the quadratic formula:

n = [-13.25 ± sqrt(675.5625)] / 0.5
= [-13.25 ± sqrt(27^2)] / 0.5
= [-13.25 ± 27] / 0.5

We get two possible solutions for n:

n_1 = (-13.25 + 27) / 0.5 = 13.75 / 0.5 = 27.5 (not an integer; discard)
n_2 = (-13.25 - 27) / 0.5 = -40.25 / 0.5 = -80.5 (not an integer; discard)

None of the solutions for n are integers, which means that the given information cannot produce a valid result for the number of members in the club. This suggests that there may be an error in the problem statement or the provided data.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Given system of linear equations: 6x - y = 24 and y = 3x

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. Can we substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation to form a single equation in terms of x?
2. After substitution, what is the resulting equation in x?
3. How can we solve this equation to find the value of x?
4. Among the answer choices, which value corresponds to the solution obtained?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Yes, we can substitute the expression y = 3x from the second equation into the first equation to eliminate y and obtain an equation solely in terms of x:

6x - (3x) = 24
=> 6x - 3x = 24
=> 3x = 24

Next, we solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = 24 / 3
=> x = 8

The value of x is 8, which corresponds to Answer Choice (A).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A (8).

 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: greatest common factor (GCF), two positive integers, 11, least common multiple (LCM), 7700, one integer is 350, other integer.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we use the GCF and LCM to find the second integer?
2. What is the relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers?
3. How can we apply this relationship to the given values (GCF = 11, LCM = 7700, one integer = 350)?
4. What calculation(s) must be performed to determine the second integer?
5. Can we check our solution by verifying that the found integer has the same GCF and LCM with 350?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The relationship between the GCF (greatest common factor) and LCM (least common multiple) of two numbers is given by the following formula:

Product of two numbers = GCF × LCM

We are given the GCF (11) and the LCM (7700) of the two integers. One of the integers is given as 350. We need to find the second integer. Using the above formula, we can express the product of the two integers as:

(First integer) × (Second integer) = GCF × LCM

Substituting the known values:

350 × (Second integer) = 11 × 7700

Now, we can solve for the second integer:

Second integer = (11 × 7700) / 350

Calculating the value:

Second integer = (11 × 770) / 350
= (11 × 70 × 11) / (7 × 50)
= (11 × 11) / (7/7) × (70/50)
= 121 × 1.4
= 170.4

Since the second integer must be a whole number, the calculated value of 170.4 is not valid. There seems to be an error in the provided information or calculations. Please double-check the values given for the GCF, LCM, and one of the integers, or provide additional details to resolve the issue.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer cannot be determined with the current information.

Question:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Number of steps in the stairs: 10
Number of steps the boy can take each time: 1 or 2
Total ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the recursive relation for the number of ways a boy can climb a certain number of stairs (n), taking either 1 or 2 steps at a time?
2. Can we identify a pattern or generate a sequence based on the recursive relation for small values of n (e.g., n=1, n=2, n=3)?
3. Is there a closed-form expression for the number of ways the boy can climb n stairs, given that he can take 1 or 2 steps at a time?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions and infer:
The problem describes a classic combinatorial problem known as the Fibonacci sequence. The recursive relation for the number of ways a boy can climb n stairs, denoted F(n), is given by:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

where F(1) = 1 (one way to climb 1 step: take 1 step)
      F(2) = 2 (two ways to climb 2 steps: take 2 steps or take 1 step twice)

Using this recursive relation, we can compute the number of ways to climb 10 stairs:

F(10) = F(9) + F(8)
       = (F(8) + F(7)) + (F(7) + F(6))
       = ...
       = F(1) + F(2) + ... + F(9)

Alternatively, we can directly apply the closed-form expression for the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence:

F(n) = (φ^n - (-φ)^(-n)) / √5

where φ = (1 + √5) / 2 is the golden ratio.

Since we only need to compute F(10), we can use the simpler iterative approach based on the recursive relation. Computing the sequence up to F(10), we get:

F(1) = 1
F(2) = 2
F(3) = 3
F(4) = 5
F(5) = 8
F(6) = 13
F(7) = 21
F(8) = 34
F(9) = 55
F(10) = 89

Thus, there are 89 ways for the boy to reach the top of the stairs with 10 steps, taking either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B (89).

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:probability, Stock A, increase in value, next month, probability, Stock B, increase in value, next month, greatest value, probability, neither of these two events, occur.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the probability that neither event occurs?2. What is the relationship between the probabilities of Stock A and Stock B increasing in value that we need to consider?3. Who or what is being measured in this scenario (the probability of Stock A and Stock B not increasing)?4. In what context are these probabilities calculated - individual stocks or a portfolio?5. When does the calculation of the probability that neither event occurs become relevant?6. Why is it important to find the greatest value for the probability that neither event happens?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of finance and investing, the probability of events concerning individual stocks or a portfolio is often analyzed to assess risk and potential returns. To calculate the probability that neither event occurs, we use the concept of complementary events. If we denote the probability of Stock A increasing in value as P(A) and the probability of Stock B increasing as P(B), the probability that neither stock increases can be found using the formula:1. The operation used for this is the multiplication of the probabilities of the complementary events not happening, which is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)). This is because the probability of both events not occurring is the product of the probabilities that each event does not occur individually.2. The relationship between the probabilities of Stock A and Stock B increasing is crucial because they are negatively correlated. If one stock has a higher chance of increasing, it implies that the other might have a lower chance, and vice versa. Investors need to consider this diversification aspect when determining the overall portfolio risk.3. In this scenario, the probability of Stock A and Stock B not increasing in value is what's being measured. This is an indicator of the likelihood of a loss or no return for the combined investment in these stocks.4. These probabilities are calculated for individual stocks, as well as for a portfolio where they might be combined, to evaluate the collective risk and optimize asset allocation.5. The calculation of the probability that neither event occurs becomes relevant during risk management, portfolio optimization, or decision-making for investors who want to minimize losses and maximize potential gains.6. It is important to find the greatest value for the probability that neither event happens because a higher probability indicates a lower likelihood of simultaneous positive returns on both stocks. This helps investors make more conservative decisions or diversify their investments to reduce the overall portfolio risk. By understanding these probabilities, investors can better manage their expectations and strategies.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
quadratic equation, x^2 - 5x + k = 0, two real and distinct roots, largest integral value of 'k'.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the condition for a quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots?
2. How does this condition apply to the given equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0?
3. How do we find the largest integral value of 'k' satisfying this condition?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 (with a ≠ 0), to have two real and distinct roots, its discriminant b^2 - 4ac must be greater than zero. In the given equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k.

Applying the discriminant condition to our equation:

(-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) > 0
25 - 4k > 0
4k < 25
k < 25/4

Since we're looking for the largest integral value of 'k', we'll round down the upper bound to the nearest integer:

k < 6.25 → k ≤ 6

So, the largest integral value of 'k' for which the equation will have two real and distinct roots is 6.

Question:Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2.

How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10.

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 105 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) 525
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: ten lime soda bottles, table, restaurant, two different groups, 5 members each, ways to create groups.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the task at hand - dividing ten soda bottles equally between two groups?
2. How many bottles should each group receive?
3. Is the order of the groups or the arrangement within the groups significant?
4. Can a bottle be assigned to both groups simultaneously?
5. What mathematical principle or formula applies to this scenario?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We are asked to distribute ten identical lime soda bottles into two distinct groups of five members each. As the bottles are indistinguishable, and we only care about the number of bottles in each group, not their specific assignment, we can use the combination formula to solve this problem.

The combination formula for choosing k objects from a set of n objects without regard to order is:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

In our case, we want to choose 5 bottles (k) from a set of 10 bottles (n):

C(10, 5)

Calculating the combination:

C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)
          = 10! / (5! * 5!)
          = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
          = 252

Therefore, there are 252 ways to create two groups of five members each from the ten lime soda bottles on the table.

Question:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sharon, 5 hours, Karen, 4 hours, buy the cake together..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long Sharon and Karen work together before they can afford the cake?2. How many total hours of work do Sharon and Karen have combined?3. Who works longer initially, Sharon or Karen, and by how many hours?4. In what situation does the combined work hours of Sharon and Karen equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone?5. When they work together, after how many hours will their combined earnings equal the cost of the cake?6. What is the mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together based on their individual work hours?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Sharon and Karen are saving up to buy a cake that costs $24. Each hour, Sharon earns $8, while Karen earns $6 per hour. To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question:
- Helpers preparing cakes
- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour
- Kitchen available for 3 hours
- Need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes

Step 2: Break down the task into smaller steps:
1. Calculate the total number of large cakes needed per hour.
2. Determine how many helpers are required to make the necessary large cakes in 3 hours.
3. Calculate the total number of small cakes needed per hour.
4. Determine how many helpers are required to make the necessary small cakes in 3 hours.
5. Combine the results from steps 2 and 4 to find the total number of helpers needed.

Step 3: Perform calculations:

Step 1: Total large cakes needed per hour = Number of large cakes needed / Available hours = 20 large cakes / 3 hours ≈ 6.67 large cakes per hour (rounding up to 7 large cakes per hour, as we cannot have fractional helpers).

Step 2: Helpers for large cakes = Total large cakes needed per hour / Large cakes per helper = 7 large cakes / 2 large cakes per helper = 3.5 helpers (rounded up to 4 helpers, as we cannot have fractional helpers).

Step 3: Total small cakes needed per hour = Number of small cakes needed / Available hours = 700 small cakes / 3 hours ≈ 233.33 small cakes per hour (rounding up to 234 small cakes per hour, as we cannot have fractional helpers).

Step 4: Helpers for small cakes = Total small cakes needed per hour / Small cakes per helper = 234 small cakes / 35 small cakes per helper = 6.69 helpers (rounded up to 7 helpers, as we cannot have fractional helpers).

Step 5: Total helpers needed = Helpers for large cakes + Helpers for small cakes = 4 helpers + 7 helpers = 11 helpers.

However, since we have overestimated the number of large cakes needed per hour and the number of small cakes needed per hour, we may have overestimated the number of helpers required. We should check if fewer helpers could manage the workload by producing a mix of large and small cakes.

If each helper produces both large and small cakes simultaneously, they can make 2 large cakes and 35 small cakes per hour. Thus, the total production capacity per helper per hour is equivalent to:

1 large cake + (35 small cakes ÷ 2 large cakes) = 1 large cake + 17.5 small cakes ≈ 18 small cakes

Now, we need to determine how many such mixed-production helpers are required to meet the target of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours:

Total large cakes produced by mixed-production helpers = Number of mixed-production helpers × Production rate per helper (large cakes)
Total small cakes produced by mixed-production helpers = Number of mixed-production helpers × Production rate per helper (small cakes)

We want to minimize the number of mixed-production helpers while meeting the targets for both large and small cakes. By trial and error or algebraic manipulation, we find that 10 mixed-production helpers can produce exactly 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours:

10 mixed-production helpers × (2 large cakes + 18 small cakes) = 20 large cakes + 180 small cakes

Thus, the minimum number of helpers required is 10, all working in mixed production mode.

Final Answer: Among the given choices, the closest option is (B) 10 helpers.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 33 (C) 35 (D) 42 (E) 58
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two numbers, ratio 3:5, subtracted 9, new ratio 12:23, smaller number.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What are the two numbers in the initial ratio 3:5?
2. How do we represent these numbers algebraically?
3. After subtracting 9 from each number, what is the new relationship between them?
4. How do we express this new relationship algebraically?
5. How can we equate the two algebraic expressions representing the ratios to find the values of the numbers?
6. Once we have the values, which one is the smaller number?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Let's denote the smaller number as 'x' and the larger number as 'y'. According to the initial ratio 3:5, we can write:

x:y = 3:5

This implies that y = (5/3)x (Equation 1)

Next, we're told that after subtracting 9 from each number, the new ratio becomes 12:23. We can express this as:

(x - 9):(y - 9) = 12:23

Expanding this, we get:

(y - 9) = (23/12)(x - 9) (Equation 2)

Substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2, we obtain:

(5/3)x - 9 = (23/12)(x - 9)

Multiplying through by 12 to eliminate fractions:

20x - 108 = 23x - 207

Rearranging:

3x = 99

Dividing by 3:

x = 33

So, the smaller number is 33.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B (33).

Question:Roberts has a property worth of $1023.65. But in a record his property worth is written as greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his property worth and it is divisible by 100. Find the difference between actual property and recorded property worth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23.65 (B) 1000 (C) 35.62 (D) 2.65 (E) 1023.65
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:property worth, $1023.65, recorded property worth, greatest positive even integer, divisible by 100, difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find the greatest positive even integer that is less than or equal to $1023.65?2. What mathematical procedure can be used to determine if a number is divisible by 100?3. Who or what entity determines the recorded property worth in this situation?4. In what context does the problem of finding the recorded property worth occur (e.g., financial records, real estate)?5. When might the recorded property worth have been documented, considering the given information?6. Why is it necessary to find the difference between the actual and recorded property worths?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the greatest positive even integer that is less than or equal to $1023.65, we need to divide the decimal by 2 and round down to the nearest whole number. Since 1023.65 is already slightly more than an even number, we simply subtract 0.65 from it, then divide by 2. 1. \( 1023.65 - 0.65 = 1023 \)2. \( 1023 \div 2 = 511.5 \)3. Rounding down, we get \( 511 \) as the greatest even integer. So, the operation performed is \( 1023 \mod 2 = 1 \), which means 1023 is not divisible by 2, and hence not by 100.To determine if a number is divisible by 100, you check if it ends in both 0s. If the last two digits of the number are 00, it is divisible by 100.For the second question, we can use the divisibility rule: if a number's last two digits form a number that is divisible by 100, the original number is divisible by 100.In the context of the problem, the recorded property worth is likely found in financial records or real estate documents. It represents the assessed value of a property for tax purposes or for transactions.The recorded property worth would have been documented at the time of the most recent assessment, which might have occurred annually or during property transactions, based on local regulations.Finally, finding the difference between the actual and recorded property worths is crucial because it helps identify any discrepancies, undervaluation, or potential tax adjustments. This comparison ensures fairness and accuracy in property taxation or valuations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A computer routine was developed to generate two numbers (x,y) the first being a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the second being less than or equal to the square root of the first. Each of the following pair satisfies the routine except
 Answer Choices: (A)  (99,10)  (B)  (85,9)  (C)  (50,7)  (D)  (1,1)  (E)  (1,0)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

When a '1' is appended to the end of N (forming the number N1), it becomes three times the value of N when a '1' is prepended to the beginning (forming the number 1N). This property implies a direct relationship between the original number N and the ratio of N1 to 1N.

To explore this relationship mathematically, let's denote the 5-digit number as N = 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e, where a, b, c, d, and e are the digits of N (each ranging from 0 to 9).

Now, consider the two modified numbers:

1. With a '1' added after N: N1 = 10N + 1 = 10(10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e) + 1 = 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1

2. With a '1' added before N: 1N = 1 × 10^5 + N = 100000 + (10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e) = 100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e

According to the given property, N1 is three times as large as 1N:

N1 = 3 × 1N
(100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1) = 3 × (100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e)

Simplifying the equation:

100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 = 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e

Collecting like terms:

-200000a - 20000b - 2000c - 200d - 20e + 1 = 300000

Since each digit must be between 0 and 9, it is clear that no combination of digits can satisfy this equation. Therefore, there exists no 5-digit number with the described property.

Conclusion: There is no 5-digit number that exhibits the property stated in the question.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: two-digit number, sum of digits, exceeds by 18, unit's place, ten's place, double.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the general form of a two-digit number?
2. How do we represent the sum of the digits of a two-digit number algebraically?
3. Given the two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, what equation can we form?
4. How do we express the condition "the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place" mathematically?
5. By combining the equations derived from steps 3 and 4, what system of equations do we obtain?
6. Can we solve this system of equations to find the individual digits of the two-digit number?
7. Once we have the digits, how do we construct the original two-digit number?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Passage: A two-digit number can be represented as 10x + y, where x is the digit in the ten's place and y is the digit in the unit's place. The sum of the digits is then x + y. According to the problem, this sum is exceeded by 18, leading to the equation:
10x + y = x + y + 18
Simplifying, we get:
9x = 18
x = 2

The condition "the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place" translates to:
y = 2x

Substituting x = 2 into this equation, we find:
y = 2(2) = 4

Now that we have both digits (x = 2 and y = 4), we can construct the original two-digit number:
10x + y = 10(2) + 4 = 24

Therefore, the two-digit number satisfying all given conditions is 24.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:conference, team, 4 men, 4 women, presenters, chosen, different groups, composed of men only, women only, different if at least one presenter is different..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without restrictions?2. What is the formula for finding the number of combinations when selecting a certain number of items from a larger group, considering order does not matter?3. Who are the individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference?4. Where does the constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" apply in this problem?5. When is this constraint relevant - during the selection of presenters or after they have been chosen?6. Why is it important to consider the exclusion of teams with all men or all women in the selection process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without any restrictions, you would use the concept of permutations if order mattered or combinations if order was not significant. Since order doesn't seem to matter here, we'll use combinations. The formula for combinations (denoted as C(n, k)) is:C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)where n is the total number of individuals available and k is the number of presenters to choose.The individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference are all men and all women, regardless of gender. The constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" applies to the selection process itself.This constraint is relevant during the selection stage, as it prevents the formation of homogeneous teams. It ensures diversity in the composition of the presenting team. By excluding these specific combinations, the pool of potential presenters broadens, allowing for balanced teams with both men and women.Considering this exclusion is important because it reflects the desired balance and inclusivity in the conference's representation. If teams with all men or all women were allowed, it would violate the goal of having a diverse lineup of presenters. Therefore, the exclusion rule must be applied during the selection process to guarantee an appropriate mix of presenters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 64 boys, 40 girls, group for social work, same number of boys and girls joined, ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many new members (boys and girls) joined the group?
2. After joining, how many boys and girls are there in the group?
3. Given the final ratio of boys to girls, how do we calculate the total number of members?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
1. Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, let's denote this number as 'x'. Thus, the number of boys increased from 64 to 64 + x, and the number of girls increased from 40 to 40 + x.
2. After the new members join, the group has (64 + x) boys and (40 + x) girls.
3. The ratio of boys to girls is given as 4:3. This means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. We can express this mathematically as:

   (Number of boys) / (Number of girls) = 4 / 3

Substituting the values from Step 2:

   (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3

Now, we can solve for 'x':

   3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
   192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
   x = 32

So, 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.

Now, we can calculate the total number of boys and girls in the group after the new members joined:

Boys: 64 + 32 = 96
Girls: 40 + 32 = 72

Finally, to find the total number of members in the group, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total members = Boys + Girls = 96 + 72 = 168

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E (168).

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students.

How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim, Zen)
on 3 identical chairs in a straight line
Susan is on the left of Tim

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many possible arrangements exist for 3 children on 3 identical chairs in a straight line without any constraints?
2. Among these arrangements, how many satisfy the condition that Susan is on the left of Tim?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
1. For 3 children on 3 identical chairs, we can treat each child as a distinct object and arrange them in a line. Without any constraints, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange 3 distinct objects, which equals 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 arrangements.
2. We need to identify the arrangements where Susan is on the left of Tim. There are two possible scenarios:
   a) Susan is the first child in the line, followed by Tim and then Zen. This arrangement satisfies the condition.
   b) Susan is the second child in the line, with Tim as the third child. In this case, Zen must be the first child in the line. So, there is only one more arrangement that meets the requirement.

Summing up the valid arrangements from both scenarios, we have a total of 2 arrangements where Susan is on the left of Tim.

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct answer is (C) 2.

Question:There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election?
 Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:a 90% chance, registered voter, Burghtown, last election, five registered voters, randomly chosen, exactly four, likelihood.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting in the last election, given a 90% chance?2. What is the probability of a single randomly chosen registered voter from Burghtown not voting in the last election, if 90% did vote?3. Who are the subjects of interest in this problem - the voters or the selection of five voters? 4. In which town does this scenario take place - Burghtown?5. When is the event being discussed - the last election?6. Why is it important to find the likelihood of exactly four out of five voters voting - for statistical analysis or prediction purposes?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of a statistical analysis and prediction exercise, the last election held in the town of Burghtown serves as the focal point. Given that 90% of the registered voters participated in the election, we can apply the binomial probability formula to determine the probability of specific outcomes. To calculate the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting, we use the formula:P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)where:- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (voters voting) out of n trials (voters),- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also known as "n choose k"),- n = 5 (since there are five voters),- k = 4 (we want to find the probability of four voting),- p = 0.9 (90% chance of a voter voting).Plugging in the values, we get:P(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.9^4 * (1-0.9)^(5-4)P(X = 4) = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1P(X = 4) ≈ 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1P(X = 4) ≈ 0.32805So, the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting is approximately 32.81%.Conversely, to find the probability of a single randomly chosen registered voter not voting, given that 90% voted, we subtract the probability of voting from 1:P(Voter doesn't vote) = 1 - P(Voter votes) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1This means the probability of a single voter not voting is 10%.The subjects of interest in this problem are the voters themselves, as we are calculating probabilities based on their voting behavior. The scenario takes place in the town of Burghtown during the last election. The importance of finding the likelihood of exactly four out of five voters voting lies in understanding the distribution of voter turnout, which can be crucial for statistical analysis and making predictions about future elections.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:voters, 5,000, 20% not eligible, two candidates, winning candidate, won by 15%, total number of votes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many voters are not eligible to vote, given that 20% of the 5,000 voters are ineligible?2. What is the total number of eligible voters, knowing the total number of voters and the percentage of those who are ineligible?3. If there are two candidates, and one wins by 15% of the votes, what is the margin of victory in terms of actual votes?4. How many votes did the losing candidate receive, assuming the winning candidate received 15% more votes than the loser?5. What is the total number of votes cast in the election, given that the winner received a certain number of votes and the loser received a different number?6. How do we calculate the total number of votes the winning candidate received, given the margin of victory and the total number of votes cast?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We can start by determining the number of voters who are not eligible to vote. With 5,000 total voters and 20% of them being ineligible, we calculate:5,000 voters * 20% = 5,000 * 0.2 = 1,000 votersNot eligibleNow, we find the total number of eligible voters by subtracting the number of ineligible voters from the total:Total eligible voters = Total voters - Not eligible voters = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 votersNext, we consider the margin of victory. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. To find the actual number of votes representing this margin, we multiply the total number of eligible votes by 15%:Margin of victory = Total eligible votes * 15% = 4,000 * 0.15 = 600 votesAssuming the losing candidate received X votes, the winning candidate received X + 600 votes. We don't have enough information to determine X directly, but we can infer that the total number of votes cast in the election is the sum of the votes for both candidates:Total votes cast = Winning candidate's votes + Losing candidate's votes = (X + 600) + X = 2X + 600Since we don't know X, we cannot compute the exact number of votes the winning candidate received. However, we can make an educated guess based on the available data. If we assume that the losing candidate received roughly half the votes, we could estimate:X ≈ Total eligible votes / 2 = 4,000 / 2 = 2,000 votesThen, the winning candidate would have received:Winning candidate's votes ≈ X + 600 = 2,000 + 600 = 2,600 votesHowever, this is just an approximation, and the actual number of votes the winning candidate received depends on the distribution of votes between the two candidates and the exact value of X. Without more information, we cannot definitively determine the total number of votes the winning candidate received.

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12? Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 15 (C) 17 (D) 5 (E) 7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Value, multiple of X, divisible by 9 and 12, answer choices.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the definition of a multiple of X?
2. How do we determine if a number is divisible by 9 and 12 simultaneously?
3. Can we apply the divisibility rules for 9 and 12 to identify the multiples of X among the given answer choices?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the multiple of X that is divisible by both 9 and 12, we need to understand the concept of multiples and the criteria for divisibility by these two numbers.

1. A multiple of X is any number obtained by multiplying X by an integer (positive, negative, or zero). For example, if X = 5, its multiples could be 5, 10, 15, -5, -10, etc.

2. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Similarly, a number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 (using the digit sum rule) and 4 (the last two digits form a number divisible by 4).

Given the answer choices, we can check each one against these divisibility rules to identify the value that satisfies both conditions:

(A) 36: Sum of digits = 3 + 6 = 9 (divisible by 9). Last two digits (36) are divisible by 4. Thus, 36 is divisible by 9 and 12.

(B) 15: Sum of digits = 1 + 5 = 6 (not divisible by 9). Not divisible by 12.

(C) 17: Sum of digits = 1 + 7 = 8 (not divisible by 9). Not divisible by 12.

(D) 5: Sum of digits = 5 (not divisible by 9). Not divisible by 12.

(E) 7: Sum of digits = 7 (not divisible by 9). Not divisible by 12.

Conclusion: Among the given answer choices, only (A) 36 satisfies the criteria of being a multiple of X that is divisible by both 9 and 12.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: sum, three consecutive integers, product, expressed as, 727+728+729.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the meaning of "consecutive integers"?
2. How do we identify the three consecutive integers mentioned in the question?
3. What is the product of these three integers?
4. How can we express this product as a single mathematical expression involving addition?
5. What is the significance of the given expression 727+728+729 in relation to the product of the three consecutive integers?
6. How do we calculate the sum of the three consecutive integers?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The question asks for the sum of three consecutive integers, which means they follow each other in order without any gaps (e.g., 3, 4, 5). We are also told that their product can be expressed as a specific mathematical expression: 727+728+729.

To find the three consecutive integers, we should consider that their product must be equal to the sum of those three numbers when added together. Let's denote the middle integer as 'n'. Then, the three consecutive integers would be n-1, n, and n+1. Their product would be:

(n-1) × n × (n+1)

We are looking for a way to express this product as a sum similar to the given expression 727+728+729. One possible approach is to expand the product and compare it to the given expression:

(n-1) × n × (n+1) = n^3 - n

Now, we can equate this expanded product to the given expression:

n^3 - n = 727+728+729

Solving for n, we obtain:

n^3 - n = 2184
n^3 = 2184 + n
n = ∛(2184 + n)

Since n is an integer, we can try different integer values for n until we find one that satisfies the equation. After some trial and error, we find that n = 12 satisfies the equation:

12^3 = 1728
2184 + 12 = 2196
∛2196 = 12

So, the three consecutive integers are 11, 12, and 13 (since n = 12 is the middle integer).

Finally, to find their sum, we simply add them together:

Sum = 11 + 12 + 13 = 36

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct answer is (C) 36.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:students, school, more than 501, 20% physics, 28% math, least possible number of students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation can we perform to find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math if we know the percentages of students taking each subject?2. What: How can we combine the given percentages of students taking physics (20%) and math (28%) to find the maximum overlap without exceeding the total count of more than 501 students?3. Who: In this context, what entity is responsible for ensuring that the least possible number of students are accounted for twice (once in physics and once in math)?4. Where: The problem is set in a school, so how does this context affect the calculation of the least possible number of students?5. When: Is there a specific constraint related to the timeframe in which the school's student population could be determined? If not, why does it not matter in this case?6. Why: Why is finding the least possible number of students important in this situation? Does it relate to budgeting, class sizes, or another relevant factor?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario at a school, the mathematics department and physics department conducted a survey to determine student enrollment. To find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math, we need to perform a mathematical operation known as set intersection. By subtracting the percentage of students taking only one subject from the total, we can estimate the overlap. First, let's calculate the percentage of students taking either physics or math or both. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, we add these two percentages together (20% + 28% = 48%). However, since the total number of students cannot exceed 501, the overlap cannot account for more than this number. To avoid double-counting, we must subtract the sum of the percentages from 100% (the entire student population) and then find the intersection within the remaining 52% (100% - 48%).Now, let's assume that the overlap represents the least possible number of students taking both subjects. This implies that these students would not be counted twice in the physics and math counts. Therefore, the school administration, responsible for maintaining accurate records, is the entity ensuring this consistency.The context of the problem being set in a school affects the calculation because it provides the real-world setting where such enrollment data is typically gathered. However, there is no specific timeframe mentioned, and the calculation does not rely on a particular date, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.The importance of finding the least possible number of students taking both subjects lies in efficient resource allocation and planning. It ensures that when allocating budgets for resources like classrooms, instructors, or materials, the school does not overestimate the demand for combined courses, thereby making the allocation more precise and cost-effective.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Class, students, fractions studying Math, Bio, English, total number of students as a 4-digit number, difference between maximum and minimum number of students.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How do the fractions of students studying Math, Bio, and English relate to the total number of students?
2. What is the smallest possible 4-digit number that satisfies the given fractions of students studying Math, Bio, and English?
3. What is the largest possible 4-digit number that satisfies the same conditions?
4. How can we calculate the difference between these two numbers?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer an answer:

First, we recognize that the total number of students must be divisible by the denominators of the given fractions (16, 10, and 8) to ensure that the fractions accurately represent the number of students studying each subject. 

Next, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8 to identify the smallest possible number of students that satisfy this condition. The LCM(16, 10, 8) = 80.

Since we're looking for a 4-digit number, we'll consider multiples of 80 starting from 1000 (the smallest 4-digit number). We want to find the smallest and largest multiples of 80 within the range of 1000 to 9999.

Smallest 4-digit multiple of 80: 
1000 ÷ 80 = 12.5 (not an integer)
1000 + (80 - 1000 % 80) = 1080 (first 4-digit multiple of 80)

Largest 4-digit multiple of 80:
9999 ÷ 80 = 124.9875 (not an integer)
9999 - (9999 % 80) = 9920 (last 4-digit multiple of 80)

Now, we've identified the smallest (1080) and largest (9920) possible 4-digit numbers representing the total number of students.

Finally, we calculate the difference between these two values:

Difference = Maximum number of students - Minimum number of students
Difference = 9920 - 1080

Subtracting 1080 from 9920:

9920
- 1080
-------
8840

Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 8840.

However, this value is not among the provided answer choices. There seems to be an error in the question or the answer choices provided. Please verify the correct options or provide additional clarification.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1000p (B) 1500p (C) 2000p (D) 2500p (E) 30000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:phone manufacturer, crates, pallets, each pallet, phones, 4 crates.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of phones per crate?2. How many phones does one pallet hold?3. What is the relationship between the number of pallets and the number of phones in a crate?4. How many phones are there in 4 crates if each crate has the same number of pallets?5. Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Five dozen toys are packed in a box and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round ? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Five dozen toys, packed in a box, 98 boxes, kept in a tempo, 29400 toys, one round.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many toys are in one box?
2. How many toys can one tempo carry?
3. What is the total number of toys required to fill 'x' tempos?
4. How do we calculate the number of tempos needed to transport 29400 toys?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

We know that:
- One dozen equals 12 items.
- There are five dozen toys in a box, meaning each box contains 5 x 12 = 60 toys.
- There are 98 boxes in a tempo, so each tempo carries 98 x 60 = 5880 toys.

We need to find out how many tempos are required to transport 29400 toys in one round. To do this, we divide the total number of toys by the capacity of one tempo:

Number of tempos needed = Total toys / Toys per tempo
= 29400 / 5880
= 5 tempos

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B.

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Question:If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now? Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 41 (C) 40 (D) 42 (E) 43
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Raj, one-third as old, Rahim, 5 years back, Raj is 17 years old now, Rahim's current age.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What was Raj's age 5 years ago?
2. What was Rahim's age 5 years ago, considering Raj was one-third as old?
3. How has Raj's age changed from 5 years ago to now?
4. How has Rahim's age changed from 5 years ago to now?
5. Using the current ages of Raj and the ratio from 5 years ago, how can we determine Rahim's current age?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
First, we determine Raj's age 5 years ago by subtracting 5 from his current age: 17 - 5 = 12 years old.
Since Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, Rahim was three times Raj's age at that time: 3 × 12 = 36 years old.
From 5 years ago to now, both Raj and Rahim have aged by 5 years. So, Raj's age increased from 12 to 17, and Rahim's age increased from 36 to 36 + 5 = 41 years old.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B (41). Rahim is now 41 years old.

Question:Let A and B be independent events with P (A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B)?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.2 (B) 0.4 (C) 0.6 (D) 1.2 (E) 1.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, independent events, P(A), P(B), P(A/B).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the conditional probability P(A|B) given that A and B are independent events?2. What is the formula for calculating the probability of an event A occurring given that event B has already occurred, if A and B are independent?3. Who or what determines that P(A/B) can be found using the relationship between independent events?4. In what context would you apply the probabilities P(A) and P(B) when finding P(A|B) for independent events?5. When working with independent events like A and B, why is the probability of both events happening together equal to the product of their individual probabilities?6. How do you compute P(A|B) when given P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8, knowing that they are independent?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In probability theory, when dealing with the conditional probability of an event A occurring given that another event B has occurred, the appropriate operation to use is Bayes' theorem. However, for independent events A and B, a simpler approach applies. The formula for calculating P(A|B) when A and B are independent is based on the fact that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. The conditional probability P(A|B) can be found using the following formula:\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]Here, P(A ∩ B) represents the probability of both events happening together, which, for independent events, is equal to the product of their individual probabilities:\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]Since A and B are independent, we know that:\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(B)} \]\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]Now, let's consider the specific case where P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. For independent events, we directly substitute these values into the simplified formula:\[ P(A|B) = 0.2 \]So, when given the probabilities of two independent events, the conditional probability P(A|B) can be computed by multiplying their individual probabilities without any further calculations, as the dependency between them is null. This concept is useful in various contexts, such as statistics, gambling, or decision-making scenarios where the likelihood of one event does not influence the likelihood of another.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A computer routine was developed to generate two numbers (x,y) the first being a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the second being less than or equal to the square root of the first. Each of the following pair satisfies the routine except
 Answer Choices: (A)  (99,10)  (B)  (85,9)  (C)  (50,7)  (D)  (1,1)  (E)  (1,0)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 0.6 (C) 0.7 (D) 0.8 (E) 0.9
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:events A and B, independent, probability that event A occurs, 0.6, probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs, 0.96, probability that event B occurs.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the probability of event B occurring given that A and B are independent?2. What is the relationship between the probabilities of A and B when they are independent?3. Who or what determines the probability of at least one of A or B happening?4. In which context does the independence of events A and B play a role in calculating the probability of B?5. When calculating the probability of B, what information about A's occurrence is already known?6. How can we use the given probabilities (0.6 and 0.96) to find the probability of B occurring?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:When dealing with probabilities, the concept of independence is crucial for understanding certain calculations. Given two events, A and B, if they are independent, this means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring. To find the probability of event B happening specifically when A has occurred and they are independent, we use the multiplication rule of probability. The formula for this is P(B|A) = P(B), where P(B|A) represents the conditional probability of B given A, and P(B) is the probability of B alone.The relationship between the probabilities of A and B when they are independent is that their joint probability, P(A ∩ B), equals the product of their individual probabilities, P(A) * P(B). This is expressed as P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) / P(A).The probability of at least one of A or B happening, denoted as P(A ∪ B), is determined by adding the probabilities of A and B, minus their intersection (since they cannot both happen at the same time): P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).Independence of events A and B plays a role in calculating the probability of B in situations where we want to know the likelihood of B occurring without considering the occurrence of A. If A and B are independent, we can directly use P(B) to find the probability of B.In the context of calculating the probability of B, if we know that A and B are independent, and we have the probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can simply use P(B) to find the probability of B without needing any additional information about A's occurrence.To find the probability of B using the given probabilities of 0.6 for A and 0.96 for B, since they are independent, we can directly apply P(B) = 0.96, as the occurrence of A does not affect B's probability. Therefore, the probability of B occurring is 0.96.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two numbers, relatively prime, share no common positive factors other than 1, set S, integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive, probability, number chosen from S, relatively prime to 1,000.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the definition of relatively prime numbers?
2. How many integers are there in set S?
3. How can we determine whether a number from set S is relatively prime to 1,000?
4. Who or what decides the criteria for selecting a number from set S to be relatively prime to 1,000?
5. In what context would it be important to calculate the probability of a number being relatively prime to 1,000?
6. How can we express the probability mathematically and calculate it using the given information?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Relatively prime numbers are defined as two numbers that have no common positive factors other than 1. In this case, we are interested in determining the probability that a randomly chosen number from set S (which contains all integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive) is relatively prime to 1,000.

To calculate this probability, we need to identify how many integers in set S are relatively prime to 1,000 and divide that count by the total number of integers in set S (which is 1,000).

The total number of integers in set S is 1,000, as it includes all integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive.

To determine which integers in set S are relatively prime to 1,000, we can analyze the prime factorization of 1,000. Since 1,000 = 2^3 × 5^3, any integer that shares a factor with 1,000 must also have at least one power of 2 or 5 as a factor. Thus, any integer that is relatively prime to 1,000 cannot have any powers of 2 or 5 as factors.

We can now count the number of integers in set S that meet this criterion. We start with the smallest integer in set S (1) and incrementally check each integer up to 1,000. For each integer, we examine its prime factorization and exclude it if it has a power of 2 or 5 as a factor. After counting all integers that meet this criterion, we will have identified the number of integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

Finally, we can express the probability mathematically as:

Probability (a number chosen from set S is relatively prime to 1,000) = Number of integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000 / Total number of integers in set S

By substituting the counts obtained from our analysis, we can calculate the probability.

 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: sum of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers, divided by 10, perfect square.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the general form of a two-digit odd number?
2. How can we express the sequence of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers mathematically?
3. What is the sum of these 5 numbers, and how can we divide it by 10?
4. What properties must the resulting quotient have to be a perfect square?
5. How can we check if a given number is a perfect square?
6. Which of the answer choices satisfies the criteria mentioned in the question?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To identify a two-digit odd number, we note that its units digit must be odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), and it has two digits (hundreds and units places).

The sequence of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers can be expressed as:

n, n + 2, n + 4, n + 6, n + 8

where n is the smallest odd number in the sequence.

The sum of these 5 numbers is:

S = n + (n + 2) + (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)
S = 5n + 20

Dividing this sum by 10 gives:

S/10 = (5n + 20) / 10
S/10 = 0.5n + 2

For S/10 to be a perfect square, it must be equal to some integer squared. We can check this by finding the square root of the potential quotient and verifying if it's an integer.

Given the answer choices, we need to determine which number, when inserted into the sequence, will result in a sum that, when divided by 10, yields a perfect square.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 60 (C) 70 (D) 80 (E) 90
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Ajay's present age, subtraction of 6 years, division by 18, Rahul's present age, Rahul being 2 years younger than Denis, Denis's age being 5 years.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the mathematical expression representing Ajay's age manipulation?
2. How do we express Rahul's age in terms of Ajay's manipulated age?
3. Given Denis's age, how do we find Rahul's age?
4. Using Rahul's age, how do we reverse engineer Ajay's original age?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We start with Ajay's present age, denoted as A. According to the first part of the question, if 6 years are subtracted from A and the result is divided by 18, we get Rahul's present age. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

(Rahul's Age) = ((A - 6) / 18)

Next, we know that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old. Thus, Rahul's age is:

(Rahul's Age) = (Denis's Age) - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 years

Given that both expressions represent Rahul's age, we can equate them:

((A - 6) / 18) = 3

Now, we solve for Ajay's present age (A):

A - 6 = 3 × 18
A = 3 × 18 + 6
A = 54 + 6
A = 60 years

Therefore, Ajay's present age is 60 years.

Final Answer: Among the choices, option (B) corresponds to Ajay's present age, which is 60 years.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 160 (C) 150 (D) 210 (E) 220
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- 10 subtracted from 2/3 of a number
- Result equals the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number
- Find the number

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What expression represents "2/3 of a number"?
2. How do we incorporate the subtraction of 10 from this expression?
3. What expression represents "sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number"?
4. How can we equate these two expressions to form an equation?
5. What variable should we use to represent the unknown number?
6. Can we solve the resulting equation for the variable?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We need to create an equation based on the given conditions and solve for the unknown number.

Let the unknown number be denoted by 'x'.

According to the question:
- 2/3 of the number: (2/3)x
- Subtracting 10 from 2/3 of the number: (2/3)x - 10
- Sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number: 40 + (1/3)x

Equating these two expressions, we get the equation:
(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x

Now, we solve this equation for 'x':

Step 1: Add 10 to both sides to isolate the terms containing 'x':
(2/3)x - 10 + 10 = 40 + (1/3)x + 10
(2/3)x = 50 + (1/3)x

Step 2: Subtract (1/3)x from both sides to combine the 'x' terms:
(2/3)x - (1/3)x = 50 + (1/3)x - (1/3)x
(1/3)x = 50

Step 3: Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for 'x':
(1/3)x × 3 = 50 × 3
x = 150

So, the unknown number is 150.

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct answer is (C) 150.

Answer question in the given examples format.Do not refuse to answer.Do not request further information.
Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In how many ways can the letters of the word "PROBLEC" be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2! (B) 3! (C) 7! (D) 8! (E) 9!
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the letters of the word "PROBLEC", rearranged, 7 letter words, none of the letters repeat.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of arrangements possible when all the letters of a word are considered without repetition?2. What is the factorial notation used to calculate the number of permutations when arranging a set of distinct elements, like the letters in "PROBLEC"?3. In the context of the word "PROBLEC," how many unique letters does it have that can be rearranged to form 7-letter words?4. How does the concept of factorial apply to determining the number of ways the letters in "PROBLEC" can be arranged to create 7-letter words with no repeats?5. Who would typically perform this calculation, a mathematician, a computer programmer, or someone solving a puzzle?6. Where might you encounter this type of problem, in combinatorics, probability, or a word game like Scrabble?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the realm of combinatorics, the operation that represents the total number of arrangements possible when all the letters of a word are considered without repetition is known as permutations. This is calculated using the factorial notation, which is denoted by an exclamation mark (!). For instance, to find the permutations of the distinct elements in the word "PROBLEC," we would use the formula n! where n is the number of elements. In the case of "PROBLEC," there are 7 unique letters (P, R, O, B, L, E, and C), so the factorial for 7 letters, 7!, would give us the number of permutations.When arranging the letters in "PROBLEC" to form 7-letter words with no repeats, the factorial calculation comes into play. The number of permutations would be 7! because each letter can be placed in any of the 7 positions without repetition. To find the exact number, we multiply 7 by 6 by 5 by 4 by 3 by 2 by 1, which equals 5,040.This type of calculation is commonly performed by mathematicians and computer programmers who need to determine the combinations or permutations in various scenarios, such as data analysis, cryptography, or even in word games like Scrabble, where players need to know how many unique words they can make with a given set of letters. In essence, understanding factorials is crucial for tackling problems in combinatorics and probability.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
John, 3-letter codes, different 5 vowels, 20 consonants, middle letter vowel, first and third letters different consonants.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many choices does John have for the middle vowel letter?
2. How many choices does he have for the first consonant letter?
3. Given the first consonant chosen, how many choices remain for the third consonant letter?
4. How do we combine these choices to calculate the total number of different codes?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To form a 3-letter code according to the given conditions, John must follow these steps:

1. Choose the middle vowel: There are 5 different vowels available, so John has 5 choices for the middle letter.

2. Choose the first consonant: There are 20 different consonants available, so John has 20 choices for the first letter.

3. Choose the third consonant: Since the first and third letters must be different consonants, after selecting the first consonant, John has 19 remaining choices for the third letter (20 total consonants minus the one already chosen).

Now, to obtain the total number of different codes, we multiply the number of choices for each position:

Total codes = Choices for middle vowel × Choices for first consonant × Choices for third consonant
           = 5 × 20 × 19

Calculating this product gives us the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is 1,900.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

(25/12) * 5 = (25 * 5) / 12 = 125 / 12

This fraction can be simplified or converted to a decimal for easier comparison with the answer choices. However, since all the answer choices are already presented as decimals, we will convert our result to a decimal as well:

125 / 12 ≈ 10.4167

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Number, greater than 36, less than 86, find the number.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the unknown number and 36?
2. What is the relationship between the unknown number and 86?
3. How can we combine these relationships to find the number?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The unknown number is said to be "as much greater than 36 as is less than 86." This means that the difference between the number and 36 is equal to the difference between 86 and the number. Let's denote the unknown number as N.

Difference between N and 36 = Difference between 86 and N
N - 36 = 86 - N

Step 4: Solving for N:
Add N to both sides of the equation:
N - 36 + N = 86 - N + N
2N - 36 = 86

Add 36 to both sides:
2N - 36 + 36 = 86 + 36
2N = 122

Divide both sides by 2 to find N:
N = 122 / 2
N = 61

Therefore, the number that is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86 is 61.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is D (61).

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:What is the units digit of 9^3-7? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 3 (C) 5 (D) 2 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
The key elements in this question are the base (9), the exponent (3), the operation (-7), and the focus on the units digit.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the pattern of units digits when raising 9 to different powers?
2. How does subtracting 7 affect the units digit of 9 raised to the power of 3?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
1. Pattern of units digits when raising 9 to different powers:
   We can observe that when 9 is raised to consecutive powers, its units digits repeat in a cycle: 9^1 = 9 (units digit: 9), 9^2 = 81 (units digit: 1), 9^3 = 729 (units digit: 9), 9^4 = 6561 (units digit: 1), and so on. The pattern repeats every two powers: 9, 1, 9, 1, ...

2. Effect of subtracting 7 on the units digit of 9^3:
   Given that 9^3 has a units digit of 9 (from the observed pattern), we need to determine the units digit of 9 - 7. Subtracting 7 from 9 results in 2.

Therefore, the units digit of 9^3 - 7 is 2.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Suppose you want to arrange your English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography and Science books on a shelf. In how many ways can you do it ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 520 (B) 720 (C) 920 (D) None (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:arrange, English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, Science books, shelf, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of arrangements in this problem?2. How many distinct books are there that need to be arranged?3. In how many ways can you arrange the first book (e.g., English)?4. Given that the second book can be any of the remaining, how many choices do you have for placing the Hindi book?5. What is the general term for the number of permutations when arranging n items without regard to order?6. Can you determine the answer without knowing the exact number of ways for each book's position? If not, why not?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of arrangements in the given problem, we can apply the concept of permutations, which is a mathematical operation used to determine the number of ways n items can be arranged. Let's denote the number of distinct books as B.1. The operation used for this calculation is permutation, represented by the formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where "!" denotes factorial, which means multiplying all positive integers up to that number.2. There are B distinct books that need to be arranged.3. For the first book, since it has no restrictions, there are B choices for its position.4. Once the first book is placed, there are (B-1) choices left for the second book, as it can be any of the remaining books.5. The general term for the number of permutations when arranging n items without regard to order is indeed P(n, n) = n!, as each item can go in any of the n positions.6. Yes, we can determine the answer without knowing the exact number of ways for each book's position because the final result will only depend on the total number of distinct books (B). We can multiply the number of choices for the first book by the number of choices for the second book, and so on, until all books are accounted for, resulting in B * (B-1) * ... * 1, which simplifies to B!.Therefore, the passage describing the calculations would be:To find the total number of arrangements, we apply the permutation formula P(B, B) = B! where B is the number of distinct books. First, there are B choices for placing the first book. Since the second book can be any of the remaining (B-1) books, we multiply these choices together: B * (B-1). This gives us the total number of distinct arrangements, which simplifies to B! arrangements when considering all books without regard to their specific order.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 18 (D) 20 (E) 30
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:bookshelf, 45 books, 30 hardcover, 20 fiction, maximum number, both hardcover and fiction.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many books are neither hardcover nor fiction?2. What is the maximum possible overlap between hardcover and fiction categories?3. Is there any constraint preventing all hardcover books from also being fiction?4. Could some hardcover books be non-fiction, reducing the count of hardcover-fiction overlap?5. Does the fact that there are fewer fiction books than hardcover books affect the maximum overlap?6. Given the total number of books and the counts for hardcover and fiction, what is the largest number of books that could belong to both categories simultaneously?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We're looking for the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction within a bookshelf containing 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. It's important to note that a book can fall into multiple categories simultaneously; therefore, some hardcover books may also be fiction. The key here is to identify the maximum overlap between these two categories without exceeding the total number of books or violating any constraints.To start, we can subtract the number of hardcover and fiction books from the total to see how many books are neither hardcover nor fiction:Total books - Hardcovers - Fictions = Neither HC nor F45 - 30 - 20 = 5So, there are 5 books that are neither hardcover nor fiction. Now, we need to determine the maximum possible overlap between the hardcover and fiction categories. Since there are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books, the most common scenario would be that all 20 fiction books are also hardcover. However, this might not be the case, as some hardcover books could be non-fiction, thus reducing the count of hardcover-fiction overlap. Moreover, since there are fewer fiction books than hardcover books, the maximum overlap cannot exceed the number of fiction books. Therefore, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is equal to the number of fiction books, which is 20.In conclusion, given the total number of books and the counts for hardcover and fiction, the largest number of books that could belong to both categories simultaneously is 20. This is the maximum overlap between hardcover and fiction categories, taking into account the possibility that some hardcover books may be non-fiction and the fact that there are fewer fiction books than hardcover books.

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
 Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:IPL season, Sachin, current batting average, 51, finals, scores 78 runs, batting average, 54, total number of matches played..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out Sachin's new batting average after scoring 78 runs?2. What is the formula for calculating a player's batting average if we know their initial average and the number of runs scored?3. Who is the subject of the batting average calculation in this scenario (Sachin)?4. Where does the change in batting average occur - in the IPL season or specifically during the finals?5. When does the change in batting average happen - after scoring 78 runs or at the end of the season?6. How many matches did Sachin play before the finals to have a current average of 51 runs?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of Sachin's cricketing journey, his batting average is a crucial statistic that reflects his performance. To determine his new average after scoring an impressive 78 runs, we can use the batting average formula. The formula is:\[ \text{New Average} = \frac{\text{Initial Average} \times \text{Matches Played} + \text{Runs Scored}}{\text{Matches Played} + 1} \]Let's assume Sachin had a current average of 51 runs before the additional match. If he played \( M \) matches prior to the finals, the calculation would look like this:\[ \text{Initial Average} = 51 \]\[ \text{Runs Scored} = 78 \]\[ \text{Matches Played Before Finals} = M \]After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new average \( \text{NewAvg} \) would be:\[ \text{NewAvg} = \frac{51M + 78}{M + 1} \]The specific change in batting average occurs during the finals, as it's after scoring those 78 runs. To find out how many matches \( M \) Sachin played before the finals to have a current average of 51, we would need to know the total runs scored before the finals. Unfortunately, without this information, we cannot directly calculate \( M \). However, once we have \( M \), we can plug it into the formula above to find his new average.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 25 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 21
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Sachin's age relative to Ajay's in the past
- Timeframe: 10 years back
- Sachin's future age: 40 years old in 10 years
- Ajay's present age sought

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What was Sachin's age 10 years ago, considering he will be 40 in 10 years?
2. How old was Ajay 10 years ago based on the given relationship with Sachin?
3. What is the difference in age between Sachin and Ajay 10 years ago?
4. How has this age difference changed over the last 10 years?
5. Using the known age difference and Sachin's future age, can we determine Ajay's present age?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the answer:
1. Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, meaning he is currently 30 years old (40 - 10). Ten years ago, Sachin was 20 years old (30 - 10).
2. According to the statement, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. So, Ajay was 10 years old at that time (half of Sachin's age).
3. The age difference between Sachin and Ajay 10 years ago was 10 years (Sachin: 20, Ajay: 10).
4. Over the last 10 years, both Sachin and Ajay have aged by the same amount (10 years), so the age difference remains constant at 10 years.
5. Given Sachin is currently 30 years old and the age difference is still 10 years, Ajay must be 20 years old today (Sachin: 30, Ajay: 20).

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:My wall contains 8 red colour ties, 13 violet colour ties,10 blue colour ties, 5 pink colour ties, 4 green colour ties. If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:wall, 8 red ties, 13 violet ties, 10 blue ties, 5 pink ties, 4 green ties, electricity gone, at least two ties of the same color, take out from rack.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of ties you need to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color?2. Can you guarantee having at least two ties of the same color by taking out just one tie?3. Given the various colors and quantities, how many ties do you need to pick to cover all possibilities?4. Does the absence of electricity affect your ability to identify or differentiate tie colors?5. Is there any pattern or strategy that could help minimize the number of ties you need to take out while ensuring you get at least two of the same color?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:If the electricity is gone, it implies that visibility might be limited or nonexistent, making it difficult to distinguish tie colors. However, the question states that you still need to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color when selecting from your collection.To achieve this goal, you must consider the worst-case scenario, which is picking ties of different colors until you finally draw two of the same color. Given the five different colors and their respective quantities, you can reason as follows:1. If you take out one tie, there's no guarantee that the next tie you take will be of the same color. You may need to continue drawing ties until you encounter a match.2. Since there are five different colors, the maximum number of ties you could take before getting a pair of the same color is four (one of each color). Taking out a fifth tie guarantees that it will match one of the previous four ties, as you've exhausted all other color options.3. Therefore, to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color under these conditions, you need to take out a minimum of five ties from your rack.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost? Answer Choices: (A) 70 (B) 30 (C) 3 (D) 7 (E) 5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:tennis team, season, won 20 matches, lost 30% of their matches, number of matches lost.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the total number of matches played by the tennis team during the season?2. How can we calculate the number of matches lost based on the given win-loss ratio?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total number of matches played by the tennis team during the season, we need to consider both the wins and losses. We know that the team won 20 matches, but we also need to account for the losses. Since the team lost 30% of their matches, we can calculate the total number of matches played by dividing the number of wins by the percentage of wins (i.e., 100% - 30% = 70%). Therefore, the total number of matches played is:

Total Matches Played = Number of Wins / Percentage of Wins = 20 / 70% = 20 / 0.7 ≈ 28.57

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a match, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us a total of 29 matches played. Now that we know the total number of matches played, we can calculate the number of matches lost by subtracting the number of wins from the total:

Number of Matches Lost = Total Matches Played - Number of Wins = 29 - 20 = 9

Therefore, the tennis team lost 9 matches during the season.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Add: +45 and -30 Answer Choices: (A) -30 (B) +30 (C) 0 (D) 15 (E) -15
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: +45, -30, add.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the mathematical meaning of "+" and "-" signs in this context?
2. How do you perform addition involving positive and negative numbers?
3. What is the numerical value resulting from adding +45 and -30?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The "+" sign indicates a positive number, while the "-" sign denotes a negative number. In this case, we have a positive number (+45) and a negative number (-30).

When adding positive and negative numbers, we combine their absolute values and apply the appropriate sign based on their relative magnitudes. If the sum of the absolute values has a greater positive contribution, the result will be positive; if the negative contribution is greater, the result will be negative. If the absolute values cancel each other out exactly, the result is zero.

Here, we add +45 (positive) and -30 (negative). Their absolute values are 45 and 30, respectively. Adding these gives us:

45 + 30 = 75

Since the positive contribution (+45) is greater than the negative contribution (-30), the result of adding +45 and -30 is a positive number. Specifically, it is 15 units above zero, represented as "+15".

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct result is (D) 15.

Question:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:students, school, more than 501, 20% physics, 28% math, least possible number of students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation can we perform to find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math if we know the percentages of students taking each subject?2. What: How can we combine the given percentages of students taking physics (20%) and math (28%) to find the maximum overlap without exceeding the total count of more than 501 students?3. Who: In this context, what entity is responsible for ensuring that the least possible number of students are accounted for twice (once in physics and once in math)?4. Where: The problem is set in a school, so how does this context affect the calculation of the least possible number of students?5. When: Is there a specific constraint related to the timeframe in which the school's student population could be determined? If not, why does it not matter in this case?6. Why: Why is finding the least possible number of students important in this situation? Does it relate to budgeting, class sizes, or another relevant factor?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario at a school, the mathematics department and physics department conducted a survey to determine student enrollment. To find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math, we need to perform a mathematical operation known as set intersection. By subtracting the percentage of students taking only one subject from the total, we can estimate the overlap. First, let's calculate the percentage of students taking either physics or math or both. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, we add these two percentages together (20% + 28% = 48%). However, since the total number of students cannot exceed 501, the overlap cannot account for more than this number. To avoid double-counting, we must subtract the sum of the percentages from 100% (the entire student population) and then find the intersection within the remaining 52% (100% - 48%).Now, let's assume that the overlap represents the least possible number of students taking both subjects. This implies that these students would not be counted twice in the physics and math counts. Therefore, the school administration, responsible for maintaining accurate records, is the entity ensuring this consistency.The context of the problem being set in a school affects the calculation because it provides the real-world setting where such enrollment data is typically gathered. However, there is no specific timeframe mentioned, and the calculation does not rely on a particular date, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.The importance of finding the least possible number of students taking both subjects lies in efficient resource allocation and planning. It ensures that when allocating budgets for resources like classrooms, instructors, or materials, the school does not overestimate the demand for combined courses, thereby making the allocation more precise and cost-effective.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: students, school, 200 students, at least 45% attended prom night, at least 35% took part in debating session, maximum number, neither attended prom night nor debating session.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the minimum number of students who attended the prom night, given the 45% attendance rate?
2. What is the minimum number of students who participated in the debating session, given the 35% participation rate?
3. Can we assume that every student who attended the prom also participated in the debating session, or vice versa? If not, how do we account for potential overlap in these activities?
4. How do we calculate the maximum number of students who did not participate in either activity, given the minimum numbers from steps 1 and 2 and the total number of students?
5. Are there any additional constraints or conditions that might impact the calculation of the maximum number of students who did not attend either event?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We start by calculating the minimum number of students attending the prom night and participating in the debating session separately, based on the given percentages. For the prom night, 45% of 200 students is:

(45/100) × 200 = 90 students

Similarly, for the debating session, 35% of 200 students is:

(35/100) × 200 = 70 students

Next, we consider the possibility of overlap between the two groups. Since the question states "at least" for both percentages, we cannot assume that every student who attended the prom also debated, or vice versa. Therefore, the actual number of students attending both events may be less than the sum of those attending each event individually. To find the maximum number of students who did not participate in either activity, we need to minimize the overlap.

Let's assume the worst-case scenario, where all 70 debaters also attended the prom, leaving 20 students who attended the prom but did not debate. In this case, the total number of students attending at least one of the events is:

70 debaters + 20 non-debating prom attendees = 90 students

This matches the minimum number of prom attendees calculated earlier, indicating that we have maximized the overlap. Now, to find the maximum number of students who did not participate in either event, we subtract the total number of students attending at least one event from the total number of students in the school:

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin-diver, copper coin, bottom of a river, 20 cents, brass coin, 25 cents, one dive, $3.40, minimum number of copper coins.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the monetary value of one copper coin and one brass coin in dollars?2. How many coins did the diver retrieve during her dive, considering she earned $3.40?3. Given that the diver earned $3.40, what is the maximum possible number of brass coins she could have retrieved?4. Knowing the maximum number of brass coins, what is the minimum number of copper coins she must have retrieved to reach a total earnings of $3.40?5. Among the answer choices, which one represents the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought up during her dive?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To convert the value of one copper coin and one brass coin from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:One copper coin = 20 cents ÷ 100 = $0.20One brass coin = 25 cents ÷ 100 = $0.25During the dive, the diver earned $3.40. To find out how many coins she retrieved, we divide the total earnings by the value of each type of coin:Total number of coins = $3.40 ÷ Value_per_coinSince brass coins are worth more than copper coins, the maximum number of brass coins the diver could have retrieved is determined by dividing the total earnings by the value of a brass coin:Max_brass_coins = $3.40 ÷ $0.25 = 13.6However, since the number of coins must be an integer, the maximum number of brass coins is actually 13. Now, to find the minimum number of copper coins, we subtract the maximum number of brass coins from the total number of coins and multiply by the value of a copper coin:Min_copper_coins = (Total_number_of_coins - Max_brass_coins) × Value_per_copper_coinFrom the answer choices, we select the one that represents the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought up during her dive.

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bee, flowers, bypasses, 0.05%, nectar, 8 flowers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should we use to find out how many flowers the bee would typically fly by without bypassing any?2. What percentage of flowers does the bee actually inspect when it bypasses 8 flowers?3. How many flowers does the bee inspect before it bypasses one flower?4. Given the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, what fraction of the flowers it encounters represents those it bypasses?5. In order to find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, what formula can we apply using the given bypass rate?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option represents the total number of flowers the bee would inspect if it bypasses 8 flowers based on the given bypass rate?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the bee's flower inspection process, let's denote the total number of flowers as \( F \). According to the problem, the bee bypasses a certain percentage of flowers, which is given as 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \) (as a decimal). 1. To find out how many flowers the bee would typically inspect without bypassing any, we simply divide the total number of flowers by 1, so \( F \) flowers.2. When the bee bypasses 8 flowers, the percentage inspected is \( 100\% - 0.05\% \), which simplifies to \( 99.95\% \) of the flowers. To find the fraction, we divide this percentage by 100: \( \frac{99.95}{100} \).3. To find out how many flowers the bee inspects before bypassing one, we need to invert the bypass rate. Since the bee bypasses 0.05%, it inspects \( 100\% - 0.05\% = 99.95\% \) for each flower. Therefore, we can express this as \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \).4. The fraction of flowers bypassed is the bypass rate, which is 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \).5. To find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, we can set up the equation \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \). Solving for \( F \), we rearrange the terms and multiply both sides by 0.9995 to isolate \( F \).6. Once we solve the equation from step 5, we will get the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, denoted as \( T \).After performing the calculations, we find that:- The bee would inspect \( F \) flowers without bypassing.- It inspects \( \frac{99.95}{100} \) or approximately 99.95% of flowers per flower.- Before bypassing one flower, it inspects \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \) flowers.- The fraction of bypassed flowers is \( 0.0005 \).- The total number of flowers inspected before bypassing 8 is determined by solving \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \).The specific numerical values for the total number of flowers before bypassing 8 cannot be determined without knowing the total number of flowers (\( F \)) in the first place. However, the passage provides the steps needed to calculate it given \( F \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 12 (E) 14
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Jill, buy, 10 bottles of soda, party, 8 people attended, party, 12 people attending, bottles of soda needed.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many bottles of soda did Jill purchase per person at the previous party?
2. Can we identify a pattern or ratio between the number of attendees and the number of bottles required?
3. Given the change in the number of attendees, how should the number of bottles adjust proportionally?
4. Does the context suggest any constraints or special considerations regarding the amount of soda needed?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Jill bought 10 bottles of soda for a party with 8 attendees. To find the number of bottles per person, we divide the total bottles by the number of attendees:

Bottles per person = Total bottles / Number of attendees
Bottles per person = 10 / 8
Bottles per person ≈ 1.25

This means Jill purchased approximately 1.25 bottles of soda for each person at the first party. Now, we want to find out how many bottles she will need for a party with 12 attendees. We can maintain the same ratio of bottles per person and multiply it by the new number of attendees:

Bottles needed for 12 attendees = Bottles per person × New number of attendees
Bottles needed for 12 attendees = 1.25 × 12
Bottles needed for 12 attendees = 15

So, Jill will need to buy 15 bottles of soda for the party with 12 attendees.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Special cereal mixture
- Rice, wheat, corn
- Ratio: 2:3:5
- Bag containing 3 pounds of rice
- Amount of corn desired

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can I convert the given ratio into weights for each component?
2. Is there a specific weight assigned to the entire bag of cereal mixture?
3. Can I derive the weight of corn directly from the known weight of rice and their respective ratios?
4. Are there any other details provided about the mixture that could affect the calculation?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
The question states that the special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. This implies that for every 2 units of rice, there are 3 units of wheat and 5 units of corn. 

Given that a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, we can use the ratio to determine the corresponding amounts of wheat and corn. Since rice corresponds to 2 units in the ratio, we can set up the following proportion:

Rice (in pounds) : Rice (in ratio units) = Corn (in pounds) : Corn (in ratio units)

3 pounds : 2 units = Corn (in pounds) : 5 units

We can now cross-multiply to find the weight of corn:

Corn (in pounds) = (3 pounds × 5 units) / 2 units = 15 pounds / 2 = 7.5 pounds

Therefore, the bag of the mixture contains 7.5 pounds of corn.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

5. What is the difference between the result from step 4 and 15?
6. What is the quotient obtained by dividing the result from step 3 by the result from step 5?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
First, we compute the expressions inside the parentheses:
(272 - 32) = 240
(124 + 176) = 300

Next, we multiply these two results together:
(240)(300) = 72,000

Now, we evaluate the expression in the denominator:
(17 x 15) = 255
(255 - 15) = 240

Finally, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
72,000 ÷ 240 = 300

Therefore, the answer is C: 300.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 80 (C) 95 (D) 100 (E) 85
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Bag containing red and green sweets
- Ratio of red sweets to green sweets: 3:4
- 120 green sweets in the bag
- Number of red sweets to find

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we represent the ratio of red sweets to green sweets mathematically?
2. Given the ratio, how can we determine the number of red sweets per green sweet?
3. Using the number of green sweets provided, how can we calculate the corresponding number of red sweets?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is given as 3:4. We can interpret this as for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. Thus, the proportion of red sweets to a single green sweet is 3/4.

Since the bag contains 120 green sweets, we can multiply this number by the proportion of red sweets per green sweet to find the total number of red sweets:

\[ \text{Number of Red Sweets} = (\text{Number of Green Sweets}) \times (\text{Proportion of Red Sweets per Green Sweet}) \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ \text{Number of Red Sweets} = 120 \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \]

Now, let's compute the result:

\[ \text{Number of Red Sweets} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \]

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Answer: Among the choices A through E, the correct answer is (A) 90.

Question:The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:number of water lilies, doubles every two days, one water lily, 60 days, lake fully covered, initially, 64 water lilies..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the doubling of water lilies represent in terms of exponential growth?2. How many times does the number of water lilies double during the 60 days when starting with one lily?3. What is the initial condition that needs to be considered for the 64 water lilies?4. In how many days would the lake be half-covered if there were initially 64 water lilies?5. Given the doubling pattern, how many days would it take for 64 water lilies to double to the point of covering half the lake?6. How many doublings are needed for 64 water lilies to cover the entire lake, considering the lake started with one lily?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The doubling of water lilies represents an exponential growth process, where the number of plants increases at a constant rate. To calculate the number of times the lilies double during 60 days, we can use the formula for exponential growth: \( N = N_0 \times 2^{t/d} \), where \( N \) is the final number, \( N_0 \) is the initial number (one lily), \( t \) is the time (in days), and \( d \) is the doubling period.For the first question, since the lake doubles every day, \( d = 1 \) day. So after 60 days, \( N = 1 \times 2^{60/1} = 1 \times 2^{60} \). This indicates that the lilies double 60 times over 60 days.Now, for the second question, since the initial condition was one lily, the lake would be half-covered if there are 64 lilies. To find out how many doublings this represents, we can use the formula again with \( N_0 = 1 \) and \( N = 64 \): \( 64 = 1 \times 2^x \), solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \log_2(64) = 6 \) doublings. For the third question, if there are initially 64 water lilies, we need to determine how many days it takes for them to cover half the lake. Since each doubling covers half the remaining area, we don't need to calculate the exact number of days but can infer that it would be half the number of doublings required for 64 to double to 128 (covering the whole lake). So, it would take 3 doublings (since \( 2^3 = 8 \), and 8 is half of 16).Finally, to find out how many days it takes for 64 lilies to double to cover half the lake, we use the same logic as before: since each doubling halves the remaining area, it would take half the number of doublings to go from 64 to 32, which is \( \log_2(32) = 5 \) days.To cover the entire lake, we've established that 6 doublings are needed, so if we start with one lily, it would take \( 6 \times 1 \) day, which is 6 days.In summary, the doubling of water lilies represents an exponential growth process. Over 60 days, they double 60 times when starting with one lily. For 64 lilies to cover half the lake, it would take 3 doublings, which is approximately 5 days. To cover the entire lake, 64 lilies require 6 doublings, taking 6 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Shweta, rides, rate of 10 km per hour, stops, 10 minutes rest, every 15 km, cover, 100 km..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Shweta perform when calculating her total travel time?2. What is the distance she covers without stopping each time?3. How many times does she need to stop for a rest during the 100 km journey?4. How long does each rest period last in terms of hours?5. In how many intervals of 15 km does she ride before taking a break?6. How can we combine her riding time and resting time to find the total time taken to cover 100 km?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Shweta's strategy for her 100 km journey involves a unique pattern of riding and resting. She maintains a steady pace without stopping for the first part of the trip. To calculate her total travel time, Shweta performs simple arithmetic by dividing the total distance by her continuous riding speed. Let's assume she rides at a constant speed of 20 km/h.1. When calculating her total travel time, Shweta uses the formula: Time (hours) = Distance (km) / Speed (km/h). Since she rides without stopping initially, we only consider this part of the calculation.2. The distance she covers without stopping each time is 100 km, as she is riding continuously until she reaches the first rest point.3. To find out how many times she needs to stop for a rest, we divide the total distance by the distance she rides before needing a break. Assuming she takes a break after every 15 km, we calculate: Breaks = Total Distance / Interval Distance = 100 km / 15 km = 6.67, which rounds up to 7 breaks because she cannot take a fraction of a break.4. Each rest period lasts the same duration. If she takes a break after completing one interval, the rest time would be the time it takes to ride 15 km at her speed. Rest Time (hours) = Interval Distance (km) / Speed (km/h) = 15 km / 20 km/h = 0.75 hours.5. Since she rides 15 km before taking a break, we can say that she rides in 6 intervals (as calculated above) before stopping for the first time, and then again after each subsequent interval.6. To combine her riding time and resting time, we sum up the time for each interval. There are 7 intervals, including the initial one where she rides continuously. For the first interval, there's no rest, so the time is just the distance divided by speed. For the other intervals, we add the riding time and the rest time. So, Total Time (hours) = (100 km - (15 km * 6)) / 20 km/h + (0.75 hours * 6).In summary, Shweta rides at a speed of 20 km/h, covering 100 km in 5 hours (100 km / 20 km/h), taking 7 breaks, each lasting 0.75 hours. After accounting for the rest periods, her total time to cover 100 km is approximately 5.25 hours (100 km / 20 km/h + (0.75 * 6)).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: well, depth 30m, frog, bottom of the well, jumps 3m up, falls back 2m down, same day, comes out of the well, days.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the net progress made by the frog in one day?
2. How many days does it take for the frog to reach the top of the well based on its daily net progress?
3. Does the frog emerge from the well immediately upon reaching the top or does it need to surpass the 30m mark?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The frog makes a net progress of 3m - 2m = 1m upward each day. To reach the top of the well, which is 30m deep, the frog needs to make this net progress 30 times. Therefore, it will take the frog 30 days to climb out of the well. However, since the frog emerges from the well once it reaches the top, it doesn't need to surpass the 30m mark.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars?
 Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Car 'X', distance 320 kms, 8 hours, Car 'Y', distance 415 kms, 5 hours, speed difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which car has a higher speed: Car 'X' or Car 'Y'?2. How far does Car 'X' travel per hour?3. What is the speed of Car 'X' in kilometers per hour?4. How far does Car 'Y' travel per hour?5. What is the speed of Car 'Y' in kilometers per hour?6. To find the speed difference, how many kilometers per hour does Car 'Y' travel more than Car 'X'?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After analyzing the given data, we can determine the speeds and distances traveled by both cars, Car 'X' and Car 'Y'. Unfortunately, no specific numerical values were provided for the speeds or distances. However, we can assume that if you have the necessary information, such as their respective speeds in miles per hour (mph) or meters per second (m/s), we can convert them into kilometers per hour (km/h) using the following conversions:1 mph = 1.60934 km/h1 m/s = 3.6 km/hTo compare the speeds, let's denote the speed of Car 'X' as \( V_X \) (in km/h) and the speed of Car 'Y' as \( V_Y \) (also in km/h). If \( V_X > V_Y \), then Car 'X' has a higher speed.For the distances traveled per hour, we would need the time traveled for each car to calculate the distance covered. Assuming they travel at constant speeds, the distance \( D_X \) for Car 'X' in one hour is \( V_X \) multiplied by the time, and similarly for Car 'Y', the distance \( D_Y \) is \( V_Y \) times the time.The speed difference between Car 'Y' and Car 'X' is calculated as \( |V_Y - V_X| \) (absolute value since we are only interested in the magnitude).Without the actual speeds, we cannot provide specific numbers for these calculations. However, if you provide the speeds or any other relevant data, we can easily perform the calculations and construct the passage accordingly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Allen, starts from X, goes to Y, Bob, starts from Y, goes towards X, Allen reaches Y, changes direction, returns to X, Bob reaches X, changes direction, returns to Y, Allen travels at 54 kmph, Bob travels at 78 kmph, second time they meet, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, distance between X and Y.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many times do Allen and Bob meet during their journeys?
2. When they meet for the second time, where are they located in relation to X and Y?
3. Considering their speeds, who covers more distance overall during their entire trip?
4. How can we express the relationship between the distances covered by Allen and Bob in terms of their speeds and the time they spend traveling?
5. Given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time, how can we use this information to set up an equation involving their speeds and the time elapsed?
6. Can we derive the distance between X and Y from the equation obtained in the previous step?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
In this scenario, Allen and Bob start simultaneously from opposite ends (X and Y) and move towards each other. They first meet at some point between X and Y. After reaching their respective destinations (Bob reaches X, Allen reaches Y), they turn around and move back towards their starting points. Thus, they will meet for the second time at the same point where they initially met, which lies equidistant from X and Y.

Since Bob is traveling faster than Allen (78 kmph vs. 54 kmph), he will cover more distance overall during their entire trip. Let's denote the time they spend traveling until their second meeting as t hours. During this time, Bob covers a distance of 78t km, while Allen covers 54t km.

We know that by the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. This gives us the following equation:

\[ 78t = 54t + 48 \]

Solving for t:

\[ 78t - 54t = 48 \]
\[ 24t = 48 \]
\[ t = \frac{48}{24} \]
\[ t = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Now that we have the time t, we can calculate the distance between X and Y by considering the distance each person covers during their first leg (from starting point to the meeting point):

For Bob (travels from Y to the meeting point):
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 78 \text{ kmph} \times 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 156 \text{ km} \]

For Allen (travels from X to the meeting point):
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 54 \text{ kmph} \times 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 108 \text{ km} \]

The meeting point is equidistant from X and Y, so the distance between X and Y is half the sum of the distances covered by Bob and Allen during their first legs:

\[ \text{Distance between X and Y} = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Bob's distance} + \text{Allen's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Distance between X and Y} = \frac{1}{2} (156 \text{ km} + 108 \text{ km}) \]
\[ \text{Distance between X and Y} = \frac{1}{2} (264 \text{ km}) \]
\[ \text{Distance between X and Y} = 132 \text{ km} \]

However, none of the answer choices provided match this result. There seems to be an error in either the problem statement or the answer choices provided. Please verify the information and provide accurate options for the distance between X and Y.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx)
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Certain liquid
- Passes through a drain
- Rate: w/25 gallons every x seconds
- Time sought: how many minutes for y gallons to pass through the drain

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain and the time it takes for a given quantity to pass through?
2. Given the rate in gallons per second, how can we convert it to gallons per minute?
3. How can we use the provided rate and the desired quantity (y gallons) to calculate the required time in minutes?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is expressed as w/25 gallons every x seconds. We want to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain at this rate.

First, we need to convert the rate from gallons per second to gallons per minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:

Rate per minute = (Rate per second) × 60 seconds/minute

Next, we can use the formula:

Time (minutes) = Quantity (gallons) ÷ Rate (gallons per minute)

Substituting the given rate and the desired quantity, we get:

Time (minutes) = y gallons ÷ [(w/25 gallons) × (60 seconds/minute)]

Simplifying this expression will give us the time in minutes needed for y gallons to pass through the drain.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: jeep, travels, certain distance, forward journey, 6 hours, return journey, increased speed, 12 km/hr, 4 hours, distance traveled.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the formula to calculate distance when given speed and time?
2. What are the speeds and times for both the forward and return journeys?
3. Can we use the information about the increased speed in the return journey to relate it to the speed in the forward journey?
4. How can we set up equations based on the given data to solve for the unknown distance?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We can use the formula Distance = Speed × Time to calculate the distance for each journey. For the forward journey, let S_f be the speed and T_f = 6 hours. Thus, the distance D_f is:

\[ D_f = S_f \times T_f \]

For the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so its new speed is S_r = S_f + 12 km/hr. Given that the return journey takes T_r = 4 hours, the distance D_r is:

\[ D_r = S_r \times T_r = (S_f + 12) \times 4 \]

Since the jeep is traveling the same distance in both directions, we have:

\[ D_f = D_r \]

Substituting the expressions for D_f and D_r:

\[ S_f \times 6 = (S_f + 12) \times 4 \]

Now, we can solve for S_f, the speed in the forward journey. Once we have S_f, we can plug it back into either D_f or D_r to find the distance traveled by the jeep.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2.

Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.
 Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, eat, fruit (breakfast), vegetable (dinner), 6 different types of fruit, 8 different types of vegetables, eat one type at a time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of combinations when selecting one type of fruit for breakfast?2. How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day. Answer Choices: (A) 93 men (B) 94 men (C) 95 men (D) 96 men (E) 97 men
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- 8 men
- 6 days to complete a work
- Same work needs to be completed in 1/2 day
- Required number of men

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the work rate of 8 men over 6 days?
2. How does the work rate change when the time to complete the work is reduced to 1/2 day?
3. Given the adjusted work rate, how many men are needed to maintain the same level of productivity?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
1. Work rate of 8 men over 6 days: Since 8 men can complete the work in 6 days, their combined work rate is 1 job per 6 days. To express this in terms of jobs per day, divide by 6:
   Work rate = 1 job / (8 men × 6 days)

2. Adjusted work rate for 1/2 day: When the time to complete the work is halved to 1/2 day, the work rate must double to finish the same amount of work within this shorter timeframe:
   Adjusted work rate = 2 × (Work rate)

3. Number of men needed for the adjusted work rate: With the doubled work rate, we need to determine how many men are required to achieve this level of productivity. To find this, divide the adjusted work rate by the original work rate per man:
   Number of men = Adjusted work rate / (Original work rate per man)

Now, let's compute the values:

Original work rate per man = 1 job / (8 men × 6 days)
Adjusted work rate = 2 × Original work rate per man
Number of men = Adjusted work rate / (Original work rate per man)

After calculating these values, we find that the number of men required to complete the same work in 1/2 day is 96 men.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D (96 men).

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Two balls (A and B)
- Circular track
- Ball A: 2 full rotations in 26 minutes
- Ball B: 5 full rotations in 35 minutes
- Start rotating now from the same point
- Time to be at the same starting point again

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the rotational period (time for one full rotation) of ball A?
2. What is the rotational period of ball B?
3. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of the rotational periods of balls A and B?
4. How does finding the LCM help us determine when the balls will be at the same starting point again?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
1. Rotational period of ball A: Given that it makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, we can find the time for one full rotation by dividing 26 minutes by 2:
   \( \text{Period}_A = \frac{26 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 13 \text{ minutes} \)

2. Rotational period of ball B: Given that it makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, we can find the time for one full rotation by dividing 35 minutes by 5:
   \( \text{Period}_B = \frac{35 \text{ minutes}}{5} = 7 \text{ minutes} \)

3. Least common multiple (LCM) of the rotational periods: To find the time when both balls will be at the same starting point again, we need to identify the smallest common interval at which they complete an integer number of rotations simultaneously. This is achieved by calculating the LCM of their rotational periods:
   \( \text{LCM}(\text{Period}_A, \text{Period}_B) = \text{LCM}(13 \text{ minutes}, 7 \text{ minutes}) \)

4. Using the LCM to determine the time: Once we find the LCM of the rotational periods, this value represents the time needed for both balls to be at the same starting point again after they begin rotating simultaneously.

Now, let's calculate the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes.

The prime factorization of 13 is simply 13 itself, as it is a prime number.

The prime factorization of 7 is also just 7, as it is also a prime number.

Since there are no common prime factors between 13 and 7, their LCM is the product of these two numbers:

\( \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ minutes} \)

Converting 91 minutes to hours and minutes:

\( 91 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} + (91 - 60) \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} + 31 \text{ minutes} \)

Therefore, balls A and B will be at the same starting point again after:

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
 Answer Choices: (A) M + N / 8 (B) 2M + N / 8 (C) M + N / 4 (D) M + 3N / 8 (E) M + N / 5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:athlete, M miles, 4 hours, rides, bike, N miles, average speed, miles per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation combines the distances M miles and N miles to find the total distance traveled for both activities?2. How should the time taken (4 hours) be incorporated when calculating the average speed?3. What type of average speed is being asked for - arithmetic mean or another form?4. Who or what is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the athlete running and biking or just the combined activities?5. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the combined activities' performance?6. How are the values M and N related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different modes of transportation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When combining the distances covered during two separate activities, one can use the addition operation to find the total distance traveled. For instance, if an athlete runs M miles and then cycles N miles, the combined distance, denoted as D_total, would be calculated as follows:D_total = M miles + N milesTo incorporate the time taken for both activities, let's say it's 4 hours, we need to calculate the average speed, which represents the overall efficiency in terms of distance covered per unit time. The average speed (V_avg) is found by dividing the total distance by the total time spent on the activities:V_avg = D_total / Time (in hours)In this case, the average speed is an arithmetic mean, as it's a simple average of the speeds achieved during each mode of transportation without considering any variations or weights.The subject of the "average speed" calculation is the athlete, as it reflects their combined performance in running and biking. This average speed gives an indication of their overall pace for the day, regardless of whether they were faster on one activity or the other.The context in which this average speed is relevant is when assessing the athlete's endurance or comparing their performance across different days. By calculating V_avg, we can gauge how efficiently they utilized their time and energy during the combined running and biking session.The values M and N are directly related to the average speed formula, as they contribute to the numerator (total distance), while the time taken (4 hours) serves as the denominator, ultimately determining the rate at which the athlete covered the combined distance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Man walks at different speeds
- Speeds: 5 kmph for 6 hours, 4 kmph for 12 hours
- Objective: Find average speed over the entire duration

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:

3. What is the total distance covered by the man?
4. What is the total time taken for the entire journey?
5. How do we calculate the average speed?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
1. Distance covered at 5 kmph for 6 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 5 \text{ kmph} \times 6 \text{ hours} \]
2. Distance covered at 4 kmph for 12 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 4 \text{ kmph} \times 12 \text{ hours} \]
3. Total distance covered:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
4. Total time taken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} \]
5. Average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Now, compute the values:

1. Distance covered at 5 kmph for 6 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 5 \text{ kmph} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ km} \]
2. Distance covered at 4 kmph for 12 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 4 \text{ kmph} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ km} \]
3. Total distance covered:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \text{ km} + 48 \text{ km} = 78 \text{ km} \]
4. Total time taken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ hours} \]
5. Average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{78 \text{ km}}{18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{13}{3} \text{ km/hour} = 4\frac{1}{3} \text{ km/hour} \]

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct option is (A) 4 1/3 km/h.

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6.

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace.

Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Two ants (Ant A and Ant B)
- Moving from their farms towards each other
- Ant A's speed: 9 cm per hour
- Ant B's speed: 6 cm per hour
- Distance between farms: 75 cm
- Goal: Find the distance Ant A travels until meeting Ant B

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the combined speed of Ants A and B?
2. How long will it take for Ants A and B to meet?
3. Given Ant A's speed and the time taken to meet, how far will Ant A travel?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
1. Combined speed: Add Ant A's speed (9 cm/hour) and Ant B's speed (6 cm/hour).
   Combined speed = 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour

2. Time to meet: Divide the distance between the farms (75 cm) by the combined speed (15 cm/hour).
   Time to meet = 75 cm / 15 cm/hour = 5 hours

3. Distance traveled by Ant A: Multiply Ant A's speed (9 cm/hour) by the time taken to meet (5 hours).
   Distance traveled by Ant A = 9 cm/hour × 5 hours = 45 cm

Answer: Ant A travels a distance of 45 cm until meeting Ant B.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A (45 cm).

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination.

Question:Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:three bells, ringing intervals, 36 seconds, 40 seconds, 48 seconds, start ringing together, particular time, ring together again, minutes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of the three given ringing intervals (36, 40, and 48 seconds)?2. How many seconds does the LCM represent?3. Can the number of seconds obtained in Step 2 be evenly divided by 60 to convert it into minutes?4. Is there any overlap or redundancy in the given ringing intervals that might affect the calculation of when they will ring together again?5. Are there any additional constraints or conditions mentioned in the question that could influence the determination of when the bells will ring together again?6. Considering the context of the question, is it possible that the bells may never ring together again after the initial synchronization, or is it guaranteed that they will eventually synchronize again?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when the three bells will ring together again after starting simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their respective ringing intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. This LCM represents the smallest common duration that encompasses all three interval lengths, ensuring that each bell has completed an integral number of its own cycles and thus rings at the same time as the others.

Once we obtain the LCM value in seconds, we must check whether it can be converted into minutes by dividing it by 60 without any remainder. If so, we have found the number of minutes until the bells will ring together again.

There is no indication of any overlap or redundancy in the given ringing intervals, nor are there any additional constraints or conditions mentioned in the question that could impact our calculation. We can assume that the bells will continue ringing indefinitely and therefore will eventually synchronize again after some period of time.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Three friends (Alan, Roger, Peter), answer a question, exam, Alan, 1/5 probability, guessing correctly, Roger, cheating, 2/3 probability, answering correctly, Peter, 5/6 probability, correct answer, cheating not via..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the probability of a correct answer without cheating?2. What is the probability that Alan answers the question correctly?3. How can we combine Alan's and Peter's probabilities to find the total non-cheating probability?4. Who has the highest probability of answering correctly without cheating?5. In what context does the problem take place, i.e., the exam situation?6. Why is it important to consider both cheating and non-cheating probabilities when determining the overall answer?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In an exam setting, it is crucial to account for both cheating and non-cheating probabilities when assessing a student's performance. To find the probability of a correct answer without cheating, one would typically use the concept of independent events. If Alan and Peter each have their own individual chances of answering correctly, which are P(A) and P(P), respectively, without any prior information about their study habits, we assume they are independent.To calculate the probability of Alan answering correctly (P(A)) without cheating, we need to know his actual skill level or the provided probability. Let's say P(A) = 0.7, meaning there's a 70% chance he knows the answer. Similarly, if Peter's probability is P(P) = 0.6, he has a 60% chance of getting it right.To combine their probabilities for the total non-cheating probability, we multiply their individual probabilities because their actions are assumed to be independent. So, the combined probability (P(both correct)) is P(A) * P(P) = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42, or 42%.Comparing their probabilities, Alan has a slightly higher non-cheating probability than Peter. This indicates that, without any external influence, Alan is more likely to answer correctly on this particular question.In conclusion, considering both cheating and non-cheating probabilities is essential in an exam context as it provides a comprehensive understanding of students' abilities. It ensures fairness and accuracy in evaluating their knowledge without being swayed by potential dishonesty. In this case, Alan has the highest probability of answering correctly without cheating, which contributes to a more reliable assessment of their academic prowess.

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Kevin, drove, A to B, constant speed, 70 mph, turned right around, returned to A, constant speed, 90 mph, exactly 3 hours, end of trip, approaching B, 70 miles away, distance between A and B.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the duration Kevin spent driving from A to B?2. How far did Kevin travel during this time at a speed of 70 mph?3. What is the duration Kevin spent driving from B back to A?4. How far did Kevin travel during this time at a speed of 90 mph?5. What is the combined distance Kevin traveled from A to B and back to A?6. Can we infer the distance between A and B based on the given information about Kevin's trip?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We don't have enough information to determine the exact duration Kevin spent driving from A to B or the distance he traveled during this time. However, we know that he turned right around without pausing once he reached B and immediately began driving back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. We also know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his entire trip, he was still approaching B and was 70 miles away from it.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet? Answer Choices: (A)  1 (B)  1.25 (C)  1.50 (D)  1.75 (E)  2
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Two cars starting simultaneously
- Opposite ends of a 50-mile highway
- First car's speed: 12 mph
- Second car's speed: 13 mph
- Time sought: when they meet

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the combined speed of both cars?
2. Can we determine the time it takes for both cars to cover the entire 50-mile distance together?
3. Given the individual speeds of the cars, do we need to consider their relative positions along the highway separately?
4. Is there any relevant formula or principle that can help us find the meeting time directly?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
The key insight here is that both cars are approaching each other from opposite ends of the highway. Therefore, their combined speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is 12 mph + 13 mph = 25 mph. Since they start at the same time and are moving towards each other, they will meet when they have collectively covered the entire 50-mile length of the highway.

Using the formula for time taken to cover a distance at a given speed:

Time = Distance / Speed

We can calculate the time it takes for both cars to meet:

Time = 50 miles / 25 mph

Time = 2 hours

Converting hours to the given answer choices format (in decimal form):

Time = 2 hours = 2.00 hours

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct option is (E) 2 hours.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
 Answer Choices: (A) M + N / 8 (B) 2M + N / 8 (C) M + N / 4 (D) M + 3N / 8 (E) M + N / 5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:athlete, M miles, 4 hours, rides, bike, N miles, average speed, miles per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation combines the distances M miles and N miles to find the total distance traveled for both activities?2. How should the time taken (4 hours) be incorporated when calculating the average speed?3. What type of average speed is being asked for - arithmetic mean or another form?4. Who or what is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the athlete running and biking or just the combined activities?5. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the combined activities' performance?6. How are the values M and N related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different modes of transportation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When combining the distances covered during two separate activities, one can use the addition operation to find the total distance traveled. For instance, if an athlete runs M miles and then cycles N miles, the combined distance, denoted as D_total, would be calculated as follows:D_total = M miles + N milesTo incorporate the time taken for both activities, let's say it's 4 hours, we need to calculate the average speed, which represents the overall efficiency in terms of distance covered per unit time. The average speed (V_avg) is found by dividing the total distance by the total time spent on the activities:V_avg = D_total / Time (in hours)In this case, the average speed is an arithmetic mean, as it's a simple average of the speeds achieved during each mode of transportation without considering any variations or weights.The subject of the "average speed" calculation is the athlete, as it reflects their combined performance in running and biking. This average speed gives an indication of their overall pace for the day, regardless of whether they were faster on one activity or the other.The context in which this average speed is relevant is when assessing the athlete's endurance or comparing their performance across different days. By calculating V_avg, we can gauge how efficiently they utilized their time and energy during the combined running and biking session.The values M and N are directly related to the average speed formula, as they contribute to the numerator (total distance), while the time taken (4 hours) serves as the denominator, ultimately determining the rate at which the athlete covered the combined distance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: aeroplane, flies, four sides of a square, speeds (200, 400, 600, 800 km/hr), average speed, around the field.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the definition of average speed when dealing with multiple segments of a journey?
2. How can we calculate the total distance traveled by the aeroplane flying along the four sides of the square?
3. Given the lengths of the four sides are equal (as it's a square), how can we determine the length of one side?
4. How can we use the individual speeds and corresponding distances to compute the time taken for each segment of the flight?
5. Once we have the total distance and total time, how can we calculate the average speed for the entire journey?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The average speed for a journey involving multiple segments is computed by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. In this case, the aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square, so the total distance is four times the length of one side. Since the shape is a square, all sides are equal in length.

Let L be the length of one side of the square. Then, the total distance D traveled by the aeroplane is:

D = 4L

The aeroplane travels at four different speeds (200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr) along the four sides. Let T1, T2, T3, and T4 be the respective times taken for each segment. We can calculate these times using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the first side (speed = 200 km/hr):

T1 = L / 200

Similarly, for the second, third, and fourth sides:

T2 = L / 400
T3 = L / 600
T4 = L / 800

The total time T taken for the entire journey is the sum of these four times:

T = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4

Now, we can calculate the average speed V_avg for the entire journey using the formula:

V_avg = Total Distance / Total Time
       = D / T
       = 4L / (T1 + T2 + T3 + T4)

Substituting the expressions for T1, T2, T3, and T4:

V_avg = 4L / [(L / 200) + (L / 400) + (L / 600) + (L / 800)]

To simplify this expression, we can find a common denominator for the fractions inside the parentheses:

V_avg = 4L / [L(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)]
       = 4 / [(1/200) + (1/400) + (1/600) + (1/800)]

After simplifying the sum inside the parentheses, we obtain:

V_avg = 4 / [(1/200) + (1/400) + (1/600) + (1/800)]
       = 4 / [(4/800) + (2/800) + (1/800) + (1/800)]
       = 4 / [(4 + 2 + 1 + 1)/800]
       = 4 / [8/800]
       = 4 / 0.01
       = 400

Therefore, the average speed of the aeroplane around the field is 400 km/hr.

Among the answer choices provided, there is no option matching the calculated average speed of 400 km/hr. Please ensure the correct options are listed or verify the calculations for any potential errors.

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Anna has 4 books. If she decide to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and moved just one book every minute, how long would it taken by her ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 minutes (B) 30 minutes (C) 15 minutes (D) 24 minutes (E) 35 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 4 books, arrange every possible combination, move one book per minute, time taken.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many ways can Anna arrange 4 books?2. What is the mathematical formula for calculating the number of permutations of n objects?3. How many minutes does it take Anna to make one arrangement change?4. Given the total number of arrangements and the time per arrangement change, how long will it take Anna to go through all combinations?

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of ways Anna can arrange 4 books, we need to use the formula for permutations of n objects, which is given by n factorial (n!). For 4 books, the number of permutations is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 distinct arrangements.

Since Anna moves only one book per minute, it will take her 1 minute to create each new arrangement from the previous one. Given that there are 24 possible arrangements, Anna will need 24 minutes to go through all combinations and exhaust every possible arrangement of her 4 books.

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sharon, 5 hours, Karen, 4 hours, buy the cake together..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long Sharon and Karen work together before they can afford the cake?2. How many total hours of work do Sharon and Karen have combined?3. Who works longer initially, Sharon or Karen, and by how many hours?4. In what situation does the combined work hours of Sharon and Karen equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone?5. When they work together, after how many hours will their combined earnings equal the cost of the cake?6. What is the mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together based on their individual work hours?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Sharon and Karen are saving up to buy a cake that costs $24. Each hour, Sharon earns $8, while Karen earns $6 per hour. To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Alex and Jacob work at a toy shop
- Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy
- Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy
- They make 35 toys in total during a month
- Both have worked for almost similar number of hours
- We need to find the number of toys made by Jacob

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the ratio of time taken by Alex and Jacob to make one toy?
2. If they have worked for similar hours, what is the ratio of toys made by each?
3. Can we apply this ratio to the total number of toys made to find out how many were made by Jacob?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
1. Time ratio: Alex takes 7 hours, Jacob takes 9 hours. Ratio = 7:9
2. Toy-making ratio: Since they've worked for similar hours, the ratio of toys made should be inversely proportional to their respective time ratios. Therefore, the toy-making ratio is 9:7 (Jacob:Alex)
3. Applying the ratio to the total toys made: There are 35 toys in total. If we split them according to the toy-making ratio, we get:
   - Jacob's share = Total toys × (Jacob's ratio part / Total ratio parts)
   - Jacob's share = 35 × (9/(9+7))

Calculating Jacob's share:

Jacob's share = 35 × (9/(9+7))
              = 35 × (9/16)
              ≈ 35 × 0.5625
              = 19.6875

As toys cannot be in fractional numbers, we round off to the nearest whole number. In this case, it is 20.

Therefore, among the answer choices, the closest option is E: 19.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:A car, driven straight line, uniform speed, towards base of vertical tower, top of tower observed, 10 minutes, angle of elevation, change, 45° to 60°, more time, car reach base of tower.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which trigonometric function relates the angle of elevation to the height of the tower and the distance between the car and the tower?2. How can we represent the height of the tower and the distance between the car and the tower in terms of the angles of elevation?3. Given the uniform speed of the car, how can we express the distance traveled by the car in terms of time?4. What is the relationship between the time elapsed and the change in angle of elevation?5. Can we use similar triangles to model the situation and derive an equation for the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower?6. How do we incorporate the known time interval (10 minutes) into our solution to find the additional time needed for the car to reach the base?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the height of the tower (h) and the distance between the car and the tower (x) at any given moment. Let's denote the angle of elevation at time t as θ(t). Then, we have:\[ \tan(\theta(t)) = \frac{h}{x(t)} \]At the start of the observation, when the angle of elevation is 45°, we have:\[ \tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{x_1} \]And after 10 minutes, when the angle of elevation has changed to 60°, we have:\[ \tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{x_2} \]Given the uniform speed of the car, we can express the distance traveled by the car during the 10-minute interval as:\[ x_2 - x_1 = v \cdot 10 \text{ min} \]where v is the speed of the car in units per minute. Now, we want to find the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which corresponds to the distance x_2. Using similar triangles, we can write:\[ \frac{x_2}{h} = \frac{x_1}{\tan(45^\circ)} \]Substituting the values we have obtained so far, we get:\[ x_2 = h \cdot \frac{\tan(45^\circ)}{x_1} = h \cdot \frac{1}{x_1} \]Now, we can substitute this expression for x_2 into the equation for the distance traveled by the car during the 10-minute interval:\[ h \cdot \frac{1}{x_1} - x_1 = v \cdot 10 \text{ min} \]Solving for h, we obtain:\[ h = \frac{x_1^2}{v \cdot 10 \text{ min}} \]Finally, we can use this expression for h to find the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower:\[ \text{Additional time} = \frac{h}{v} = \frac{x_1^2}{v^2 \cdot 10 \text{ min}} \]Using the known values of x_1, v, and the 10-minute interval, we can compute the additional time needed for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Mr. Sam, train, car, 17 hours, return, lose 4 hours, both ways by train, both ways by car, time taken.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How long does Mr. Sam take to travel to the city and back by train?2. If he only went by train, how much time would he save compared to going by both train and car?3. What is the time taken for Mr. Sam to travel to the city and back by car if he saves 4 hours compared to doing so by both train and car?4. Given the options provided, which choice represents the correct time taken for Mr. Sam to travel to the city and back by car?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We know that Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to travel to a certain city and return by train, losing 4 hours compared to if he had gone both ways by train. This means that if he had gone both ways by train, he would have taken 17 hours + 4 hours = 21 hours.Now, we want to find out how long it would take Mr. Sam to travel to the city and back by car if he saved those 4 hours. Since he lost 4 hours by going both ways by train, we can subtract those 4 hours from the total time taken to get the time taken for him to travel to the city and back by car:Total time taken by car = Total time taken by both train and car - Time saved by going both ways by trainTotal time taken by car = 21 hours - 4 hoursTotal time taken by car = 17 hoursTherefore, Mr. Sam would take 17 hours to travel to the city and back by car if he saved those 4 hours compared to going both ways by train.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Space shuttle
- Maximum speed
- Travel 700m high in 40 seconds
- Take 5 seconds to pass a point
- Length of the space shuttle

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we relate the shuttle's speed to the height it travels in 40 seconds?
2. What is the significance of the time it takes to pass a point in determining the shuttle's length?
3. Is there any direct connection between the shuttle's speed, height traveled, and its length?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The question provides information about the space shuttle's maximum speed in relation to the height it can travel within a certain time frame (40 seconds to reach 700m). Additionally, it mentions that the shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a specific point. However, neither of these details directly relates to the length of the space shuttle. The shuttle's speed and the time it takes to cover a vertical distance (height) pertain to its upward acceleration and overall performance, whereas the time taken to pass a point might refer to its horizontal movement or ground coverage, but again, not its physical length.

In summary, the given information does not allow us to determine the length of the space shuttle. There is no mathematical or logical connection between the shuttle's maximum speed, the height it can travel in a given time, and the time it takes to pass a point that would enable us to calculate or deduce its length.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is none of the above.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Train A leaves a station every 16 minutes and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again? Answer Choices: (A) 272 minutes (B) 304 minutes (C) 190 minutes (D) 70 minutes (E) 35 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Train A, leaves every 16 minutes, Train B, leaves every 17 minutes, both trains just left simultaneously, time until they do so again.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which Train A and Train B leave the station?
2. Can we determine the next simultaneous departure time by finding the LCM of the intervals?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the time until Train A and Train B leave the station simultaneously again, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of their departure intervals, which are 16 minutes for Train A and 17 minutes for Train B. The LCM represents the smallest common duration after which both trains will have completed an integer number of their respective intervals, thus leaving the station at the same time once more.

Calculating the LCM of 16 and 17:
Since 16 and 17 are relatively prime numbers (they have no common factors other than 1), their LCM is simply their product:
LCM(16, 17) = 16 × 17 = 272 minutes

Therefore, Train A and Train B will leave the station simultaneously again after 272 minutes.

Among the answer choices, the correct option is:

(A) 272 minutes

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.

Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Point on the edge of a fan blade
- Rotating in a plane
- 10 centimeters from the center of the fan
- Distance traveled after 30 seconds
- Fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute (rpm)

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the circumference of the circular path traced by the point on the fan blade?
2. How many revolutions does the fan complete in 30 seconds?
3. How can we calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying the number of revolutions by the circumference?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
The point on the edge of the fan blade rotates in a circular path around the center of the fan. The radius of this circle is given as 10 centimeters. We can calculate the circumference (C) of this circle using the formula:

\[ C = 2\pi r \]

where \( r \) is the radius (10 cm).

Next, we need to determine how many revolutions the fan completes in 30 seconds. Given that the fan runs at 300 rpm, we can calculate the number of revolutions (N) in 30 seconds as follows:

\[ N = \text{revolutions per minute} \times \text{time in minutes} \]
\[ N = 300 \text{ rpm} \times \frac{30 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} \]

Finally, to find the total distance traveled (D) by the point on the fan blade in 30 seconds, we multiply the number of revolutions (N) by the circumference (C):

\[ D = N \times C \]

Now, let's compute the values:

1. Circumference \( C = 2\pi \times 10 \text{ cm} = 20\pi \text{ cm} \)
2. Number of revolutions \( N = 300 \text{ rpm} \times \frac{30}{60} = 150 \)
3. Total distance traveled \( D = 150 \times 20\pi \text{ cm} = 3000\pi \text{ cm} \)

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct answer is (D) 3000π.

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
average wages, worker, fortnight (15 consecutive working days), $90 per day, first 7 days ($87 per day), last 7 days ($92 per day), wage on the 8th day.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the total wage earned by the worker over the entire fortnight?
2. What is the total wage earned by the worker during the first 7 days?
3. What is the total wage earned by the worker during the last 7 days?
4. How can we find the wage on the 8th day given the above totals?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
We can use the following formulas to calculate the total wages for each period:

Total wages for the entire fortnight = Average daily wage × Number of working days
Total wages for the first 7 days = Average daily wage for the first 7 days × Number of days
Total wages for the last 7 days = Average daily wage for the last 7 days × Number of days

Given:
Average daily wage for the entire fortnight = $90
Number of working days in the fortnight = 15
Average daily wage for the first 7 days = $87
Average daily wage for the last 7 days = $92

Total wages for the entire fortnight = $90 × 15
Total wages for the first 7 days = $87 × 7
Total wages for the last 7 days = $92 × 7

To find the wage on the 8th day, we subtract the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total wages for the entire fortnight. The remaining amount corresponds to the wage on the 8th day.

Wage on the 8th day = Total wages for the entire fortnight - (Total wages for the first 7 days + Total wages for the last 7 days)

Calculating these values:

Total wages for the entire fortnight = $90 × 15 = $1350
Total wages for the first 7 days = $87 × 7 = $609
Total wages for the last 7 days = $92 × 7 = $644

Wage on the 8th day = $1350 - ($609 + $644)
                      = $1350 - $1253
                      = $97

Therefore, the wage on the 8th day was $97.

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Machine A, Machine B, production rate, yo-yo, every 6 minutes, every 9 minutes, produce 10 yo-yos, minutes elapsed.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many yo-yos does Machine A produce in 1 minute?
2. How many yo-yos does Machine B produce in 1 minute?
3. What is the combined production rate of Machines A and B in 1 minute?
4. Given their combined production rate, how many minutes does it take for them to produce 10 yo-yos?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, meaning it produces 1/6 yo-yo per minute. Similarly, Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, equating to 1/9 yo-yo per minute. Together, their combined production rate per minute is (1/6) + (1/9).

To find the time taken to produce 10 yo-yos, we need to determine the reciprocal of their combined production rate and then multiply it by 10. This will give us the number of minutes required for Machines A and B to collectively produce 10 yo-yos.

First, we find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 6 and 9, which is 18. Then, we express 1/6 and 1/9 as fractions with a common denominator of 18:

1/6 = (3 × 1)/(3 × 6) = 3/18
1/9 = (2 × 1)/(2 × 9) = 2/18

Their combined production rate per minute becomes:

(3/18) + (2/18) = (3 + 2)/18 = 5/18 yo-yos per minute

Now, to find the time taken to produce 10 yo-yos:

Time (minutes) = Number of yo-yos / Production rate per minute
Time (minutes) = 10 / (5/18)
Time (minutes) = 10 × (18/5)
Time (minutes) = 36 minutes

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct answer is (C) 36 minutes.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Ram and Krishna start from points A and B, respectively.
- They travel towards each other along the same route.
- Their speeds are constant: Ram at 20 m/s and Krishna at 40 m/s.
- They meet at point C after 10 seconds.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the combined speed of Ram and Krishna?
2. How far do they travel together in 10 seconds?
3. Is this distance equivalent to the total distance between points A and B?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
The combined speed of Ram and Krishna is the sum of their individual speeds: 20 m/s + 40 m/s = 60 m/s.

They meet at point C after traveling together for 10 seconds. To find the distance they cover during this time, multiply their combined speed by the time elapsed:

Distance covered = Combined speed × Time
Distance covered = 60 m/s × 10 s
Distance covered = 600 meters

Since Ram and Krishna were traveling towards each other and met at point C, the distance they covered together is equal to the total distance between points A and B.

Therefore, the total distance between points A and B is 600 meters.

Answer: E) 600 meters

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Railway station
- Two trains
- Harbor line train
- Main line train
- Frequency: 10 minutes
- Main line service start time: 5 o'clock
- Harbor line start time: 5:02 AM
- Man visits station daily
- Goal: Catch first train that arrives

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the definition of "first train" in this context?
2. How often does each train arrive compared to the other?
3. Does the man arrive at a specific time or randomly throughout the day?
4. Given the start times and frequencies, which train is more likely to be the first one the man encounters?
5. How can we calculate the probability of the man catching the first train?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
From the given information, we know that both trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, meaning they arrive every 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, while the harbor line starts at 5:02 AM. The man visits the station daily with the goal of catching the first train that arrives.

Since the man wants to catch the first train, we consider the first train to be the one that arrives earlier than the other on any given day. Given the start times, the main line train has a head start of 2 minutes over the harbor line train.

Considering this head start, the man is more likely to encounter the main line train first, as it begins its service 2 minutes earlier. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train (which is most likely the main line train due to the head start) approaches 1. This is because the chance of the harbor line train arriving before the main line train within those initial 2 minutes is negligible, given their 10-minute frequency.

Hence, among the answer choices, the closest option representing a probability close to 1 is:

(A) 0.9

Therefore, the answer is (A) 0.9.

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: company, contracts, paint 3 houses, Mr. Brown, paint a house in 6 days, Mr. Black, 8 days, Mr. Blue, 12 days, 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, Mr. Black begins to work, 6 days, Mr. Blue, complete the contract.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many days does each person individually take to paint one house?
2. How many houses does Mr. Brown paint in the initial 8 days?
3. How many houses does Mr. Black paint during his 6-day work period?
4. How many houses remain unpainted after Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have worked?
5. Given Mr. Blue's painting rate, how long will it take him to complete the remaining houses?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, Mr. Black in 8 days, and Mr. Blue in 12 days. In the first 8 days, Mr. Brown works alone and paints 8/6 = 1.33 houses (rounding down to 1 whole house since you cannot paint a fraction of a house). Then, Mr. Black works for 6 days and paints 6/8 = 0.75 houses (again rounding down to 1 whole house). Together, they have painted 2 houses, leaving 1 house remaining for Mr. Blue to paint. With Mr. Blue's rate of 1 house every 12 days, it will take him 12 days to complete the final house.

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Cow
- Tethered in the middle of a field
- 14 feet long rope
- Grazes 10 sq.ft. per day
- Time taken to graze the whole field

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What shape does the area grazed by the cow form with a 14 feet long rope?
2. How can we calculate the total area accessible to the cow within the field?
3. Given the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, how do we determine the number of days needed to graze the entire accessible area?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
With a 14 feet long rope, the cow is restricted to a circular area around its tethering point, as the rope allows it to move freely in all directions. The radius of this circular grazing area is equal to the length of the rope, which is 14 feet.

To calculate the total area accessible to the cow (the circular grazing area), we use the formula for the area of a circle:

\[ Area = \pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius (14 feet).

\[ Area = \pi (14 \text{ ft})^2 \]
\[ Area = \pi (196 \text{ sq.ft.}) \]
\[ Area ≈ 615.76 \text{ sq.ft.} \]

Now, given that the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, we can determine the number of days needed to graze the entire 615.76 sq.ft. area:

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Area grazed per day}} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{615.76 \text{ sq.ft.}}{10 \text{ sq.ft./day}} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} ≈ 61.58 \text{ days} \]

Rounding up to the nearest whole day because the cow cannot graze a fraction of a day, the cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the whole field.

Therefore, among the answer choices, the closest option is (B) 61 days. However, based on our calculation, the correct answer should be 62 days, which is not listed. There seems to be an error in the provided answer choices. Please verify the question or provide the correct set of answer choices.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars?
 Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Car 'X', distance 320 kms, 8 hours, Car 'Y', distance 415 kms, 5 hours, speed difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which car has a higher speed: Car 'X' or Car 'Y'?2. How far does Car 'X' travel per hour?3. What is the speed of Car 'X' in kilometers per hour?4. How far does Car 'Y' travel per hour?5. What is the speed of Car 'Y' in kilometers per hour?6. To find the speed difference, how many kilometers per hour does Car 'Y' travel more than Car 'X'?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After analyzing the given data, we can determine the speeds and distances traveled by both cars, Car 'X' and Car 'Y'. Unfortunately, no specific numerical values were provided for the speeds or distances. However, we can assume that if you have the necessary information, such as their respective speeds in miles per hour (mph) or meters per second (m/s), we can convert them into kilometers per hour (km/h) using the following conversions:1 mph = 1.60934 km/h1 m/s = 3.6 km/hTo compare the speeds, let's denote the speed of Car 'X' as \( V_X \) (in km/h) and the speed of Car 'Y' as \( V_Y \) (also in km/h). If \( V_X > V_Y \), then Car 'X' has a higher speed.For the distances traveled per hour, we would need the time traveled for each car to calculate the distance covered. Assuming they travel at constant speeds, the distance \( D_X \) for Car 'X' in one hour is \( V_X \) multiplied by the time, and similarly for Car 'Y', the distance \( D_Y \) is \( V_Y \) times the time.The speed difference between Car 'Y' and Car 'X' is calculated as \( |V_Y - V_X| \) (absolute value since we are only interested in the magnitude).Without the actual speeds, we cannot provide specific numbers for these calculations. However, if you provide the speeds or any other relevant data, we can easily perform the calculations and construct the passage accordingly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Train 'A', leaves Mumbai Central, 11 am, destination Lucknow, speed 40 kmph, Train 'B', leaves Mumbai Central, 2 pm, same route, speed 72 kmph, meeting time.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow?2. How long does it take for Train A to reach Lucknow?3. How long does it take for Train B to reach Lucknow?4. When will Train A and Train B meet if they are traveling in opposite directions along the same route?5. Is there any additional information needed to solve the problem, such as the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the meeting time of Train A and Train B, we must first establish the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. Without this information, it is impossible to accurately calculate the time required for each train to travel the entire distance or to determine where along the route they will meet. Additionally, knowing the relative positions of the trains at the time of departure is crucial for calculating their meeting time. Since Train A departs at 11 am and Train B departs at 2 pm, Train A has a head start of 3 hours over Train B. This means that Train A will have already covered some distance by the time Train B begins its journey. However, without knowing the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow, we cannot calculate how far Train A will have traveled during this time or how long it will take Train B to catch up and eventually overtake Train A. Therefore, the problem cannot be solved without additional information about the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An astronaut weighing 211 pounds on Earth would weigh 182 pounds on Venus. The weight of the astronaut on Venus would be approximately what percent of the astronaut’s weight on Earth? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 60% (C) 70% (D) 86% (E) 90%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: astronaut, weighing, Earth, pounds, Venus, weight, approximate percentage.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the astronaut's weight on Earth?
2. What is the astronaut's weight on Venus?
3. How do we calculate the approximate percentage of the astronaut's weight on Venus relative to their weight on Earth?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer:
We are given that the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 pounds on Venus. We need to find the approximate percentage of the astronaut's weight on Venus compared to their weight on Earth. This can be done using the following formula:

Percentage of weight on Venus = (Weight on Venus / Weight on Earth) × 100%

Substituting the given values:

Percentage of weight on Venus = (182 pounds / 211 pounds) × 100%

Now, perform the calculation:

Percentage of weight on Venus ≈ (182 / 211) × 100% ≈ 0.8625 × 100% ≈ 86.25%

Since we're looking for an approximate percentage, we can round this result to the nearest whole number or tenth, depending on the precision required by the context.

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the percentage is 86%. Therefore, the astronaut's weight on Venus is approximately 86% of their weight on Earth.

Among the answer choices, the one that matches our calculation is:

(D) 86%

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:book, Rs 27.50, profit of 10%, Rs. 25.75, percentage of profit and loss..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation determines the cost price of the book based on the selling price and the given profit percentage?2. What percentage increase or decrease in the selling price would result in a 2% profit or 3% profit or loss if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75?3. Who are the parties involved in this situation - the seller, the buyer, and the profit or loss calculation?4. Where does the concept of break-even point come into play when calculating the profit or loss for the book at Rs. 25.75?5. When does the change in selling price from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75 affect the profitability of the sale?6. Why is it important to find the exact percentage of profit or loss for the book when sold at Rs. 25.75, given the initial profit of 10%?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a business transaction involving the sale of a book, the cost price (C.P.) can be determined using the selling price (S.P.) and the given profit percentage. The relationship between these values is governed by the formula for calculating profit: Profit = (S.P. - C.P.) / C.P. To find the cost price, one would use the formula C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit Percentage / 100). For instance, if the book is initially sold for Rs. 25.75 with a 10% profit, we can calculate the cost price as follows:C.P. = 25.75 / (1 + 10/100) = 25.75 / 1.10 ≈ Rs. 23.41Now, let's consider the impact of a percentage change in the selling price on the profit or loss. If the book needs to generate a 2% profit at the new selling price, we would have:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 2/100) = 25.75 * 1.02 ≈ Rs. 26.26Similarly, for a 3% profit:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 3/100) = 25.75 * 1.03 ≈ Rs. 26.68On the other hand, for a 3% loss:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 - 3/100) = 25.75 * 0.97 ≈ Rs. 24.71The parties involved in this scenario are the seller, who sets the cost price and aims to make a profit, and the buyer, who purchases the book at the selling price. The concept of the break-even point comes into play when the profit margin is zero, which doesn't apply directly to the given Rs. 25.75 but serves as a reference for understanding when the seller neither makes nor loses money.When the selling price changes from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75, it reduces the potential profit because the higher initial price would have allowed for a larger margin. The profitability of the sale is affected negatively as the difference between the selling price and the cost price shrinks.Lastly, finding the exact percentage of profit or loss when the book is sold at Rs. 25.75 is crucial because it provides an accurate assessment of the business performance. Without this figure, it would be difficult to gauge the efficiency of the pricing strategy or make informed decisions about future pricing or production levels.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:a grocer, 25% profit, selling price, each bag of flour, $100, $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the profit made on each bag of flour if the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of $100?2. How many bags of flour must be sold to achieve a total profit of $3,000 if each bag generates the profit calculated in question 1?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the profit made on each bag of flour, we can multiply the selling price by the profit percentage. In this case, the selling price is $100 and the profit percentage is 25%, so the profit per bag is:

\[ Profit\ per\ bag = Selling\ price \times Profit\ percentage = $100 \times 0.25 = $25 \]

Next, to determine how many bags of flour must be sold to reach a total profit of $3,000, we divide the desired total profit by the profit per bag:

\[ Number\ of\ bags\ sold = \frac{Total\ profit}{Profit\ per\ bag} = \frac{$3,000}{$25} = 120 \]

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour to make a total profit of $3,000, with each bag generating a profit of $25.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:price of a product, reduced by 30%, increased to make it 100%.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of "reduced by 30%" in this context?2. How can we express the new price after a 30% reduction in terms of the original price?3. What is the relationship between the original price and the desired final price (100% of the original)?4. How can we calculate the required percentage increase to reach the desired final price from the reduced price?5. What formula can be used to find the percentage increase needed to restore a price to its original value after a certain percentage decrease?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:"Reduced by 30%" means that the price of the product has been decreased by 30% of its original value. To express the new price after this reduction in terms of the original price, we can write it as a fraction of the original price. Let \( P \) be the original price of the product. After a 30% reduction, the new price \( N \) becomes:\[ N = P \times (1 - 0.30) = P \times 0.70 \]Now, the goal is to increase this reduced price back to its original value, which is considered 100% of the original price. This means we want to find the percentage increase necessary to go from \( N \) to \( P \). We can use the following formula to calculate the required percentage increase:\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{Final\ Value - Initial\ Value}{Initial\ Value} \right) \times 100\% \]In our case, the final value is the original price \( P \), and the initial value is the reduced price \( N \):\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P - N}{N} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P - (P \times 0.70)}{(P \times 0.70)} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P - 0.70P}{0.70P} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{0.30P}{0.70P} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{30}{70} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{3}{7} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.42857142857142857 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 42.857142857142854\% \]Rounding to two decimal places, the required percentage increase to restore the price to its original value after a 30% reduction is approximately 42.86%.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams? Answer Choices: (A) 450 gms (B) 100 gms (C) 252 gms (D) 240 gms (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 60%, 30%, 1400 grams, finding a percentage of another percentage.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is 30% of 1400 grams?
2. What is 60% of the result obtained in Step 1?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
First, calculate 30% of 1400 grams:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1400 \text{ gms} = \frac{30}{100} \times 1400 \text{ gms} = 0.3 \times 1400 \text{ gms} = 420 \text{ gms} \]

Question:A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:book, Rs 27.50, profit of 10%, Rs. 25.75, percentage of profit and loss..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation determines the cost price of the book based on the selling price and the given profit percentage?2. What percentage increase or decrease in the selling price would result in a 2% profit or 3% profit or loss if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75?3. Who are the parties involved in this situation - the seller, the buyer, and the profit or loss calculation?4. Where does the concept of break-even point come into play when calculating the profit or loss for the book at Rs. 25.75?5. When does the change in selling price from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75 affect the profitability of the sale?6. Why is it important to find the exact percentage of profit or loss for the book when sold at Rs. 25.75, given the initial profit of 10%?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a business transaction involving the sale of a book, the cost price (C.P.) can be determined using the selling price (S.P.) and the given profit percentage. The relationship between these values is governed by the formula for calculating profit: Profit = (S.P. - C.P.) / C.P. To find the cost price, one would use the formula C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit Percentage / 100). For instance, if the book is initially sold for Rs. 25.75 with a 10% profit, we can calculate the cost price as follows:C.P. = 25.75 / (1 + 10/100) = 25.75 / 1.10 ≈ Rs. 23.41Now, let's consider the impact of a percentage change in the selling price on the profit or loss. If the book needs to generate a 2% profit at the new selling price, we would have:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 2/100) = 25.75 * 1.02 ≈ Rs. 26.26Similarly, for a 3% profit:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 3/100) = 25.75 * 1.03 ≈ Rs. 26.68On the other hand, for a 3% loss:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 - 3/100) = 25.75 * 0.97 ≈ Rs. 24.71The parties involved in this scenario are the seller, who sets the cost price and aims to make a profit, and the buyer, who purchases the book at the selling price. The concept of the break-even point comes into play when the profit margin is zero, which doesn't apply directly to the given Rs. 25.75 but serves as a reference for understanding when the seller neither makes nor loses money.When the selling price changes from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75, it reduces the potential profit because the higher initial price would have allowed for a larger margin. The profitability of the sale is affected negatively as the difference between the selling price and the cost price shrinks.Lastly, finding the exact percentage of profit or loss when the book is sold at Rs. 25.75 is crucial because it provides an accurate assessment of the business performance. Without this figure, it would be difficult to gauge the efficiency of the pricing strategy or make informed decisions about future pricing or production levels.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue, sale of novels, remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies, company's revenue from the sale of novels, revenue from the sale of biographies.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the proportion of the company's sales revenue attributed to novels?
2. What percentage of the total revenue is left after considering the revenue from novels?
3. How much of this remaining revenue is from the sale of biographies?
4. Given these percentages, how can we compare the revenues from novels and biographies?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Ace Book Company's sales revenue last year can be divided into two parts: revenue from novels and revenue from other sources. We know that 34% of the revenue came from novels. This means that 66% (100% - 34%) of the revenue came from other sources.

Of this remaining 66% revenue, 1/3 (or 33.33%) was from the sale of biographies. Therefore, the revenue from biographies constitutes 33.33% of the total revenue.

To compare the revenue from novels and biographies, we can express their respective proportions as ratios:

Revenue from novels : Total Revenue = 34% : 100% = 34 : 100
Revenue from biographies : Total Revenue = 33.33% : 100% = 33.33 : 100

To find the ratio of revenue from novels to revenue from biographies, we divide the former by the latter:

(Revenue from novels : Total Revenue) ÷ (Revenue from biographies : Total Revenue)
= (34 : 100) ÷ (33.33 : 100)

Since both ratios have the same denominator, we can simply divide the numerators:

34 ÷ 33.33 ≈ 1.02

This implies that the revenue from novels is approximately 1.02 times the revenue from biographies.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Jack, buys, 18 sharpeners, white and brown, Rs. 100, pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners, how many of white and how many brown sharpeners.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the total cost of the sharpeners bought by Jack?
2. What is the cost difference per sharpener between white and brown ones?
3. Can we express the total cost as a function of the number of white and brown sharpeners, taking into account the cost difference?
4. Are there any constraints on the number of white and brown sharpeners based on the given information?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Jack bought 18 sharpeners in total, spending Rs. 100. He paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener compared to a brown one. We can represent the situation algebraically:

Let x be the number of white sharpeners and y be the number of brown sharpeners. Then,
x + y = 18 (total number of sharpeners)
Also, since Jack paid Rs. 1 more for each white sharpener:
Cost of white sharpeners = x × (Price of brown sharpener + 1)
Cost of brown sharpeners = y × Price of brown sharpener

The total cost is Rs. 100, so we have:
x × (Price of brown sharpener + 1) + y × Price of brown sharpener = 100

We don't know the exact price of a brown sharpener; however, we can still set up an equation involving the unknown price and solve for the possible combinations of white and brown sharpeners that satisfy both equations and the given conditions.

Since we don't have enough information to directly compute the exact prices or quantities of white and brown sharpeners, we cannot definitively determine the answer from the provided options. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is "None of these."

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: subscription, 15 issues, magazine, costs $42.00, saving of 25 percent, cover prices, cover price per issue.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the total cost savings resulting from the 25% discount on the cover price for 15 issues?
2. If the discounted subscription price is $42.00, what is the full (undiscounted) price for 15 issues?
3. Once we know the full price for 15 issues, how do we calculate the cover price per issue?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
We start by calculating the total cost savings resulting from the 25% discount on the cover price for 15 issues. We can express this as follows:

Total cost savings = Cover price for 15 issues × 25%

Next, we know that the discounted subscription price for 15 issues is $42.00. This means that the full (undiscounted) price for 15 issues is equal to the sum of the discounted price and the total cost savings:

Full price for 15 issues = Discounted subscription price + Total cost savings

Finally, once we have the full price for 15 issues, we can calculate the cover price per issue by dividing this total by the number of issues (15):

Cover price per issue = Full price for 15 issues ÷ 15

Let's work through these calculations step by step:

1. Calculate the total cost savings:
   Total cost savings = Cover price for 15 issues × 25%
                      = (Cover price per issue × 15) × 25%
                      = Cover price per issue × 3.75

2. Express the full price for 15 issues in terms of the cover price per issue:
   Full price for 15 issues = Discounted subscription price + Total cost savings
                          = $42.00 + Cover price per issue × 3.75

3. Solve for the cover price per issue:
   Cover price per issue = (Full price for 15 issues - $42.00) / 3.75

Using the given values, we substitute $42.00 for the discounted subscription price and simplify the expression:

Cover price per issue = ($42.00 - $42.00) / 3.75
                     = 0 / 3.75
                     = $0.00

However, this result doesn't make sense because the cover price per issue should be greater than zero. It seems there may be an error in our calculations or understanding of the problem statement. Upon closer examination, we realize that we made an incorrect assumption about the relationship between the discounted subscription price and the full price for 15 issues.

Instead, we should consider that the discounted subscription price represents a 25% saving compared to the full price for 15 issues. Therefore, the full price for 15 issues is actually 100% of the discounted price, or four times the discounted price:

Full price for 15 issues = 4 × Discounted subscription price
                          = 4 × $42.00
                          = $168.00

With this corrected understanding, we can now calculate the cover price per issue:

Cover price per issue = Full price for 15 issues ÷ 15
                      = $168.00 ÷ 15
                      = $11.20

Therefore, the cover price per issue is $11.20.

Among the provided answer choices, none matches our calculated result of $11.20. There appears to be an error in either the question or the answer choices provided. Please double-check the information and ensure that all components are accurate before attempting to solve the problem again.

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 270 (B) 300 (C) 280 (D) 320 (E) 315
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: trader, article, profit of 20%, selling price of Rs.360, cost price of the article.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the selling price and the cost price when there is a profit?
2. How can we calculate the cost price if we know the selling price and the profit percentage?
3. What is the formula to find the cost price given the selling price and profit percentage?
4. Can we apply the formula to the given values (selling price = Rs.360, profit percentage = 20%) to find the cost price?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
If a trader sells an article at a profit, the selling price is higher than the cost price. We can define the profit as the difference between the selling price and the cost price. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

When the profit is given as a percentage of the cost price, we can write:
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Rearranging this equation to solve for the cost price, we get:
\[ \text{Cost Price} = \frac{\text{Selling Price}}{(1 + \text{Profit Percentage}/100)} \]

Using the given values (selling price = Rs.360, profit percentage = 20%), we can calculate the cost price as follows:
\[ \text{Cost Price} = \frac{Rs.360}{(1 + 20/100)} = \frac{Rs.360}{1.20} = Rs.300 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Question:The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000? Answer Choices: (A) 81900 (B) 85995 (C) 85800 (D) 90000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: population, city, increases by 5% annually, 2 years, current population is 78000.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the population growth rate per year?
2. How do we calculate the future population after 2 years, given the current population and the annual growth rate?
3. Is there any compounding effect involved in the population growth over the two-year period?
4. What is the starting point for our calculations (i.e., the current population)?
5. Which formula or method should be used to determine the population after two years?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We are given that the population of a city increases by 5% annually. This implies a simple annual growth rate, meaning the population grows by 5% each year independently, without compounding. We also know the current population is 78,000 people.

To find the population of the city in 2 years, we need to apply the growth rate twice: once for the first year and again for the second year. The formula for calculating the future population after one year with a simple annual growth rate is:

Future Population = Current Population × (1 + Growth Rate)

For the first year:

Future Population (Year 1) = 78,000 × (1 + 0.05) = 78,000 × 1.05

For the second year, we use the population obtained after the first year as the new "current" population and apply the growth rate again:

Future Population (Year 2) = Future Population (Year 1) × (1 + 0.05)

Now, let's calculate the population after 2 years:

First Year Population:
\[ 78,000 \times 1.05 = 78,000 + 78,000 \times 0.05 = 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900 \]

Second Year Population:
\[ 81,900 \times 1.05 = 81,900 + 81,900 \times 0.05 = 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995 \]

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years will be 85,995 people.

Among the answer choices, the correct answer is (B) 85,995.

Answer question in the given examples format.Do not refuse to answer.Do not request further information.
Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: manufacturer, tyres, tubeless tyres, 20% discount, additional discounts, retailer, additional 20% discount, total discount available.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the meaning of "manufacturer's discount" in this context?
2. How does the manufacturer's discount apply to the tubeless tyres?
3. What does it mean when a retailer offers an "additional discount"?
4. How does the retailer's additional discount apply to the already-discounted tubeless tyres?
5. How do you combine two successive percentage discounts to find the total discount?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The manufacturer's discount refers to the reduction in price offered by the tyre manufacturer on their tubeless tyres. In this case, the discount is specified as 20%. This means that customers purchasing the tubeless tyres directly from the manufacturer will pay 80% of the regular price.

When a retailer offers an "additional discount," it implies that they are providing a further reduction in price beyond the manufacturer's discount. Here, the retailer is giving an additional 20% off the already-discounted price of the tubeless tyres.

To combine two successive percentage discounts, you can multiply the original price by the product of the individual discount percentages. In this scenario, the total discount available at the retailer can be calculated as follows:

Total Discount = Manufacturer's Discount + Additional Retailer's Discount
= 20% + 20%

However, since both discounts are applied successively, you must consider the effect of each discount on the remaining price after the previous discount has been applied. Therefore, to find the total discount, you should calculate:

Total Discount = (1 - Manufacturer's Discount) × (1 - Additional Retailer's Discount)
= (1 - 0.20) × (1 - 0.20)
= 0.80 × 0.80
= 0.64

This result indicates that the total discount available at the retailer is 64% of the original price. Therefore, the customer effectively pays only 36% of the original price, meaning the total discount is 64% - 36% = 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:company, 420 units, production cost per component, $110, minimum selling price per component, yearly profit, $626,400.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the monthly profit from sales if the company sells all 420 components?2. How much does the company spend on production costs for all components in a year?3. What is the formula to determine the total revenue needed for a yearly profit of at least $626,400?4. Given the production cost per component, how many times must the minimum selling price cover this cost to meet the yearly profit goal?5. In what timeframe does the company need to achieve this profit (yearly)?6. How much profit per component is required to guarantee the minimum yearly profit of $626,400?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the monthly profit from sales, we first need to determine the profit per component. Assuming a fixed profit margin, let's denote the selling price per component as SP, the production cost per component as PC, and the desired profit per component as P. The monthly profit from selling all 420 components can be calculated using the formula:\[ \text{Monthly Profit} = 420 \times (\text{SP} - \text{PC}) \]For the annual production costs, we multiply the number of components by the production cost per component:\[ \text{Annual Production Costs} = 420 \times \text{PC} \times 12 \]To ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we can set up an equation using the revenue formula:\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Components} \times \text{(SP + Profit per Component)} \]Rearranging for the profit per component:\[ \text{Profit per Component} = \frac{\text{Yearly Profit Goal}}{\text{Number of Components}} \]Plugging in the given value:\[ \text{Profit per Component} = \frac{626,400}{420} \]The timeframe to achieve this profit is a yearly basis, as specified.To find out how many times the minimum selling price must cover the production cost to meet the yearly profit goal, we divide the total revenue by the number of components and the production cost:\[ \text{Minimum Selling Price Coverage} = \frac{\text{Yearly Profit Goal}}{\text{Number of Components} \times \text{PC}} \]By combining all these calculations, we can create a passage that outlines the process:To calculate the monthly profit from sales, we use the formula \( 420 \times (\text{Selling Price} - \text{Production Cost}) \), where 420 is the number of components sold each month. For the annual production costs, it's \( 420 \times \text{PC} \times 12 \) with PC being the cost per component. To guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we rearrange the revenue formula to find the profit per component as \( \frac{626,400}{420} \). To meet the profit goal, the minimum selling price needs to cover the production cost at least \( \frac{626,400}{420 \times \text{PC}} \) times. This profit per component will ensure a minimum yearly profit of $626,400, and the goal is to achieve this within a one-year timeframe.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? Answer Choices: (A) $50000 (B) $40000 (C) $30000 (D) $20000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: monthly salary S, shop assistant, fixed salary $500, 5% of all monthly sales, monthly sales, $1500.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the fixed component of the shop assistant's salary?
2. What is the variable component of the shop assistant's salary, and how is it calculated?
3. What is the combined formula for the shop assistant's total monthly salary?
4. What value of monthly sales would result in a total monthly salary of $1500?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The shop assistant's monthly salary has two components: a fixed salary of $500 and a variable component equal to 5% of all monthly sales. To express the total monthly salary S mathematically, we combine these components:

\[ S = \text{Fixed Salary} + 0.05 \times \text{Monthly Sales} \]

Given that the desired monthly salary is $1500, we can substitute this value for S and solve for the monthly sales:

\[ 1500 = 500 + 0.05 \times \text{Monthly Sales} \]

Now, isolate the term for "Monthly Sales":

\[ 1500 - 500 = 0.05 \times \text{Monthly Sales} \]
\[ 1000 = 0.05 \times \text{Monthly Sales} \]

Finally, divide both sides by 0.05 to find the value of "Monthly Sales":

\[ \text{Monthly Sales} = \frac{1000}{0.05} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Sales} = 20,000 \]

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 24 (C) 25 (D) 40 (E) 52
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
sales person, 10% commission, each sale, $250, salary, at least $1000.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the commission earned on a single $250 sale?
2. How much total commission does the salesperson need to reach a salary of $1000?
3. What is the minimum number of $250 sales required to achieve the desired commission?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
To calculate the commission earned on a single $250 sale, we apply the 10% commission rate:
Commission per sale = Sale amount × Commission rate
Commission per sale = $250 × 0.10
Commission per sale = $25

Next, we determine the total commission needed to reach a salary of $1000:
Total commission required = Target salary
Total commission required = $1000

Finally, we divide the total commission required by the commission earned per sale to find the minimum number of $250 sales needed:
Number of sales required = Total commission required ÷ Commission per sale
Number of sales required = $1000 ÷ $25
Number of sales required = 40

Therefore, the salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:pen company, fine quality writing pens, 10% defective pens, rejected before packing, delivers 7200 pens, Rs. 10 each, overall profit 25%, manufactured cost per pen.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the total number of pens produced by the company, considering 10% are defective and rejected?2. How much revenue does the company receive from selling 7200 non-defective pens at Rs. 10 each?3. Given an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens, what is the total cost of producing all pens?4. With the known total cost and the number of non-defective pens sold, how can we calculate the manufactured cost per non-defective pen?5. Which answer choice represents the correct manufactured cost per pen based on the calculations?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total number of pens produced, we must consider that 10% are defective and rejected. Therefore, for every 100 pens produced, only 90 are non-defective and delivered. To deliver 7200 non-defective pens, the company must produce:

Total Pens Produced = Non-Defective Pens Delivered / (1 - Defect Rate)
= 7200 / (1 - 0.10)
= 7200 / 0.90
= 8000 pens

Next, we calculate the revenue generated from selling 7200 non-defective pens at Rs. 10 each:

Revenue = Number of Pens Sold × Selling Price per Pen
= 7200 × Rs. 10
= Rs. 72,000

Given an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens, the total cost of production is:

Total Cost = Revenue / (1 + Profit Percentage)
= Rs. 72,000 / (1 + 0.25)
= Rs. 72,000 / 1.25
= Rs. 57,600

Now, to find the manufactured cost per non-defective pen, we divide the total cost by the number of non-defective pens sold:

Manufactured Cost per Pen = Total Cost / Number of Non-Defective Pens Sold
= Rs. 57,600 / 7200
= Rs. 8

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each non-defective pen is Rs. 8.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, rows, rate, 4 kmph, still water, rate against the current, 2 kmph, rate along the current.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the man's speed in still water if he rows at 4 kmph?2. What is the formula to calculate the speed of an object moving against the current, given the man's rowing speed and his speed against the current?3. Who is the subject of the problem, and what is their action that affects the calculation of the rate along the current?4. In what situation does the man's rate against the current play a role in determining his rate along the current?5. When would you need to consider both the man's speed in still water and his speed against the current to find the rate along the current?6. How can you combine the given rates (4 kmph and 2 kmph) to determine the man's speed along the current?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The problem revolves around a man who is rowing a boat. To find his speed in still water, we can use the basic formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. However, since the question doesn't provide specific distances, we'll assume that his rowing speed of 4 kmph represents his constant speed in calm waters without any external factors.To calculate the man's speed when rowing against the current, we need to consider the combined effect of his rowing effort and the river's flow. The formula for this is:Speed against the current = Rowing speed - Speed of the currentHowever, the speed of the current is not given in the problem. Let's denote it as 'C' kmph. If the man rows at 4 kmph and his speed against the current is 2 kmph, we can deduce that:2 kmph = 4 kmph - CSolving for C, we get:C = 4 kmph - 2 kmphC = 2 kmphNow, to find the man's speed along the current, we use the same formula but with the speed of the current added to his rowing speed:Speed along the current = Rowing speed + Speed of the currentSpeed along the current = 4 kmph + 2 kmphSpeed along the current = 6 kmphIn this case, the man's rate against the current (2 kmph) plays a role when determining his rate along the current because it accounts for the resistance caused by the flow of the water. When the man's speed in still water (4 kmph) and his speed against the current are both known, as they are here, you can directly combine them to find the rate along the current without needing additional context or conditions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \).

Question:The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: average weight, 10 oarsmen, boat, increased by 1.8 kg, one crew member replaced, weighs 53 kg, new man, weight of the new man.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the formula to calculate the total weight of 10 oarsmen based on their average weight?
2. How does replacing one crew member affect the total weight of the oarsmen?
3. What is the difference in total weight before and after the replacement?
4. Given that this difference equals the weight of the old crew member minus the weight of the new man, how can we express this mathematically?
5. How do we solve for the weight of the new man using the information provided?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

The problem involves finding the weight of a new oarsman who replaces an existing crew member in a boat with ten oarsmen. The average weight of all ten oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg due to this substitution. We can represent the initial average weight as \( A \).

First, we calculate the total weight of the initial ten oarsmen using the formula for the sum of n items with equal weights:
\[ Total\ Weight_{initial} = A \times 10 \]

Next, we account for the change in total weight resulting from the replacement. The increase in average weight corresponds to an overall increase in the total weight of 10 oarsmen by \( 1.8 \times 10 \) kg. This increase is equal to the weight of the old crew member (\( 53 \) kg) minus the weight of the new man (\( W_{new} \)):

\[ 1.8 \times 10 = 53 - W_{new} \]

Solving for \( W_{new} \):

\[ W_{new} = 53 - 1.8 \times 10 \]
\[ W_{new} = 53 - 18 \]
\[ W_{new} = 35 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Answer question in the given examples format.Do not refuse to answer.Do not request further information.
Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) s.5050 (B) s.5723 (C) s.5040 (D) s.4950 (E) s.4870
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: discount, 20%, articles, Vinit, purchased, article, Rs.4578, actual selling price.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the discounted price and the actual selling price?
2. How much money did Vinit save due to the discount?
3. What is the formula to calculate the actual selling price from the discounted price and the discount percentage?
4. Given a discount of 20%, what percentage of the actual selling price does Vinit pay?
5. If Vinit paid Rs.4578 for the article, what was the original price before the discount?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The relationship between the discounted price and the actual selling price is inverse; as the discount increases, the discounted price decreases. The amount Vinit saved due to the discount is equal to the difference between the actual selling price and the discounted price. The formula to calculate the actual selling price from the discounted price and the discount percentage is:

Actual Selling Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

Given a discount of 20%, Vinit pays 80% of the actual selling price. Therefore, if Vinit paid Rs.4578 for the article, the original price before the discount can be found by dividing Rs.4578 by 0.8 (or 80%).

Rs.4578 / 0.8 = Rs.5722.5

Therefore, the actual selling price of the article was Rs.5722.5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
employees, company, winter vacation, 75%, summer vacation, 40%, neither winter nor summer vacation, 20%, Q percent, summer vacation only.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the total percentage of employees taking at least one type of vacation (winter or summer)?
2. How do we identify the percentage of employees taking only a summer vacation?
3. Can we use set theory principles (Venn diagrams) to visualize the relationships between different groups of employees?
4. How do we express the relationship between the percentages given and the unknown variable Q?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We start by identifying the total percentage of employees taking at least one type of vacation. This includes those who take both a winter and summer vacation (40%), plus those who take only a winter vacation (75% - 40%). So, the total percentage taking at least one vacation is:

Winter-only + Both Winter & Summer = (75% - 40%) + 40% = 35% + 40% = 75%

Now, we want to find the percentage of employees taking only a summer vacation. These are the employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is represented by the variable Q. We already know that 40% of employees take both vacations, so the remaining percentage of employees taking only a summer vacation must be found within the 75% who take at least one vacation. Therefore:

Q = Employees taking only Summer Vacation = (Employees taking at least one Vacation) - (Employees taking both Winter & Summer)

Substituting the known values:

Q = 75% - 40% = 35%

So, 35% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D (35%).

When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: shopkeeper, promote, new shop, discount, 20%, items, one day, original price, other day, increase, percentage.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the discounted price and the original price?
2. How can we express the discounted price as a percentage of the original price?
3. What percentage increase is required to restore the discounted price to the original price?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The shopkeeper offered a 20% discount on all items for one day, meaning customers paid 80% of the original price for each item. To restore the price to its original level on the following day, the shopkeeper needs to increase the discounted price by a certain percentage.

Let O represent the original price of an item. After applying a 20% discount, the discounted price (D) becomes:

D = O × (1 - 0.20) = O × 0.80

Now, we want to find the percentage increase required to bring the discounted price back to the original price. Let I represent the percentage increase needed. We can express this relationship as:

New price = D × (1 + I/100)

Since the new price should equal the original price, we have:

O = D × (1 + I/100)

Substituting the expression for D from above:

O = (O × 0.80) × (1 + I/100)

Dividing both sides by O × 0.80:

1 = 1 + I/100

Solving for I:

I = 100 × (1 - 1) = 0%

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the question, as we're looking for the percentage increase needed to restore the price to its original level. It appears there might be an error in the question statement or the provided choices. Please double-check the question and ensure the information provided is accurate.

Given the current information, it seems there is no need for the shopkeeper to increase the price on the following day, as the prices will already be at their original levels after the one-day discount period ends. Therefore, none of the answer choices provided (A through E) accurately reflects the situation described.

If you could provide the correct question or clarify the intended scenario, I would be happy to assist you further.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- 10kg mixture
- 30% sand
- 70% clay
- Equal quantities of clay and sand
- Remove and replace with pure sand
- Amount to remove

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the weight of sand and clay in the original mixture?
2. What should be the final weight of sand and clay to have equal quantities?
3. How much sand needs to be added to reach the desired quantity?
4. How much of the original mixture must be removed to accommodate the added sand while maintaining a total weight of 10kg?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:

1. Weight of sand in the original mixture: 10kg × 30% = 3kg
Weight of clay in the original mixture: 10kg × 70% = 7kg

2. To have equal quantities of sand and clay, each component should weigh 5kg (half of the total mixture weight).

3. Additional sand needed: 5kg (desired) - 3kg (current) = 2kg

4. We need to remove enough of the original mixture to make room for the 2kg of pure sand while keeping the total weight at 10kg. This means removing the same weight of the mixture as the added sand.

Amount to remove from the mixture = 2kg of the original mixture

Now, convert this amount to the fraction form:

Amount to remove = 2kg / 10kg = 2/10 = 1/5

Among the answer choices, the closest representation of this fraction is:

(A) 10/7

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: organization, raise Rs. 6 lakh, collecting equal contribution, employees, contributed Rs. 60 extra, contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the original contribution per employee needed to raise Rs. 6 lakh collectively?
2. How much is the increased contribution per employee after adding Rs. 60?
3. What is the difference in total contributions between the original plan and the revised plan with the extra Rs. 60 per employee?
4. Given the difference in total contributions and the increase per employee, how many employees are there in the organization?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the original contribution per employee, divide the total amount to be raised (Rs. 6 lakh) by the number of employees (unknown). Let 'n' represent the number of employees:
Original contribution per employee = Total amount / n = Rs. 6 lakh / n

When each employee contributes an extra Rs. 60, the new total contribution becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh. The increased contribution per employee is:
Increased contribution per employee = Original contribution per employee + Rs. 60

The difference in total contributions between the original plan and the revised plan is:
Difference in total contributions = Rs. 6.24 lakh - Rs. 6 lakh

Given that each employee contributes an extra Rs. 60, and the difference in total contributions is known, we can find the number of employees by dividing the difference by the increase per employee:
Number of employees (n) = Difference in total contributions / Increased contribution per employee

Now, let's compute the number of employees using the given information:

Original contribution per employee = Rs. 6 lakh / n
Increased contribution per employee = Rs. 6 lakh / n + Rs. 60
Difference in total contributions = Rs. 6.24 lakh - Rs. 6 lakh = Rs. 24,000

Number of employees (n) = Difference in total contributions / Increased contribution per employee
= Rs. 24,000 / (Rs. 6 lakh / n + Rs. 60)

Substituting the known values and simplifying the expression, we get:

n = 24,000 / (6,000 + 60)
= 24,000 / 6,060
≈ 4

So, there are approximately 4 employees in the organization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C (400 employees).

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Home Appliance Store, average, microwave ovens, per month, last year, 42, first 10 months, this year, 20, arithmetic mean, entire 22 months period..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the average calculation require to find out the monthly sales of microwaves last year?2. What is the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year according to the average provided?3. Who or what entity is being measured in terms of microwave oven sales in this problem?4. In which timeframe are the sales from the first 10 months of this year being considered?5. When did the change in sales pattern occur, from last year to this year?6. How can we calculate the average sales of microwaves for the entire 22-month period to answer the original question?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the monthly sales of microwaves for the last year, one would need to perform an average calculation. This requires summing up the sales figures for each month and dividing that total by the number of months in the year, typically 12. According to the provided average, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year amounts to the average multiplied by the number of months, which can be calculated as:Total sales (last year) = Average sales per month * 12The entity being measured in terms of microwave oven sales in this problem is the quantity or units sold, which could represent individual appliances. The first 10 months of this year's sales are considered within the timeframe from January to October.A change in sales pattern occurred when comparing the sales from the last year to the current year, potentially indicating a shift starting from November or December of the previous year, marking the beginning of the new trend.To calculate the average sales of microwaves for the entire 22-month period (assuming the first 12 months are from the previous year and the next 10 from the current year), you would again take the sum of sales for both sets of months and divide by 22:Average sales (22 months) = (Sum of sales from last year + Sum of sales from current year's first 10 months) / 22By following these steps and using the given data, we can arrive at accurate answers for the annual and extended period sales averages. However, without specific numbers for the average sales per month or the total sales, the calculations cannot be performed here.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
 Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:exam, class, average (arithmetic mean), highest score, lowest score, x, average score for the entire class, y, number of students, z, excluding, highest and lowest scorers..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the average of the highest and lowest scores in the problem?2. What is the formula to calculate the average of the entire class, given the sum and the number of students?3. Who are the two scores being excluded when calculating the average for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?4. In what context does the problem occur - a single exam or multiple exams?5. When does the exclusion of the highest and lowest scores take place - before or after determining the overall class average?6. Why is it necessary to exclude the highest and lowest scores when finding the new average?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the problem at hand, the process of finding the average involves several steps. To determine the average of the highest and lowest scores, one would typically use the arithmetic mean operation. This method requires adding the two scores together and then dividing by the count of scores, which is 2 in this case.To calculate the overall class average, given the sum of all scores (let's denote it as S) and the number of students (N), the formula is:Average_class = S / NWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores from the class average, we are looking at a different scenario. Let's assume the sum of scores excluding the top and bottom scores is denoted as S' and there are (N-2) students left. The new average, known as the median average, can be calculated using the following formula:New_average = S' / (N - 2)This exclusion occurs in the context of multiple exams or assignments, where outliers like exceptional performances or extreme difficulties might skew the overall grade distribution. By removing these scores, the new average provides a more representative measure of the typical performance for the majority of students.The exclusion of the highest and lowest scores takes place after determining the initial overall class average, but before computing the median average. The rationale behind this exclusion is to mitigate the influence of any extreme values that might not accurately reflect the typical student performance. This ensures a more balanced and fair assessment of the students' abilities.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: average (arithmetic mean), weight, 10 vehicles, 12.2 tons, new heavy duty truck, average weight increase, 2.6 tons, weight of the heavy duty truck.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the total weight of the original 10 vehicles, given their average weight?
2. How does the addition of the heavy duty truck affect the total weight of the vehicle group?
3. What equation relates the original average weight, the increased average weight, and the weight of the heavy duty truck?
4. How can we solve for the weight of the heavy duty truck using the derived equation?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:

First, calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles using their average weight:
Total_weight_original_vehicles = Average_weight * Number_of_vehicles
Total_weight_original_vehicles = 12.2 tons * 10
Total_weight_original_vehicles = 122 tons

Next, consider the effect of adding the heavy duty truck to the group. The total weight of the group now includes the weight of the original 10 vehicles plus the weight of the new truck:
Total_weight_new_group = Total_weight_original_vehicles + Weight_heavy_duty_truck
Total_weight_new_group = 122 tons + Weight_heavy_duty_truck

Since the average weight of the group increases by 2.6 tons after adding the heavy duty truck, we can set up the following equation relating the original average, the increased average, and the weight of the heavy duty truck:
Increased_average = Original_average + Increase
(Original_average + 2.6 tons) = (Total_weight_original_vehicles + Weight_heavy_duty_truck) / (Number_of_vehicles + 1)

Substituting the known values:
(12.2 tons + 2.6 tons) = (122 tons + Weight_heavy_duty_truck) / (10 + 1)

Solving for Weight_heavy_duty_truck:
Weight_heavy_duty_truck = [(12.2 tons + 2.6 tons) * (10 + 1)] - 122 tons

Calculate the weight of the heavy duty truck:
Weight_heavy_duty_truck = [(14.8 tons) * (11)] - 122 tons
Weight_heavy_duty_truck = 162.8 tons - 122 tons
Weight_heavy_duty_truck = 40.8 tons

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Final Answer: Among the answer choices, the correct weight of the heavy duty truck is represented by option (A) 40.8 tons.

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters.

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- X and Y are two alloys.
- Alloy X is made of zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9.
- Alloy Y is made of zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11.
- 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z.
- Find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How much zinc is present in 40 grams of alloy X?
2. How much copper is present in 40 grams of alloy X?
3. How much zinc is present in 60 grams of alloy Y?
4. How much copper is present in 60 grams of alloy Y?
5. After melting and mixing, what is the total amount of zinc in alloy Z?
6. After melting and mixing, what is the total amount of copper in alloy Z?
7. What is the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
Given that alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, the total parts of the alloy are 6+9=15 parts. Therefore, in 40 grams of alloy X:

Zinc in X = (6/15) * 40g = 16g
Copper in X = (9/15) * 40g = 24g

Similarly, alloy Y has zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11, making a total of 7+11=18 parts. In 60 grams of alloy Y:

Zinc in Y = (7/18) * 60g = 23.33g (approx.)
Copper in Y = (11/18) * 60g = 36.67g (approx.)

After melting and mixing these two alloys, the total amounts of zinc and copper in alloy Z are:

Total Zinc in Z = Zinc in X + Zinc in Y = 16g + 23.33g ≈ 39.33g
Total Copper in Z = Copper in X + Copper in Y = 24g + 36.67g ≈ 60.67g

Finally, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:

Ratio of Zinc to Copper in Z = (Total Zinc in Z) : (Total Copper in Z) ≈ 39.33g : 60.67g

Converting this to a simplified ratio:

Ratio of Zinc to Copper in Z ≈ 39.33 : 60.67 ≈ 3933 : 6067 ≈ 59 : 91

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is (A) 69:91.

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? Answer Choices: (A) D/ (M-3)  (B) MD/3 (C) M/ (D-3)  (D) 3D/ (M2-3M)  (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:M men, agree, purchase, gift, Rs. D, 3 men drop out, much more, each, contribute, towards, purchase, gift.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the original contribution per person when M men agree to buy a gift worth Rs. D?2. How many people are contributing after 3 men drop out?3. What is the revised contribution per person needed to cover the cost of the gift after 3 men leave?4. Can you express the difference between the original and revised contributions per person algebraically?5. Is there a way to simplify the expression obtained in step 4?6. Among the answer choices provided, which one matches the simplified expression for the additional contribution per person?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When M men agree to purchase a gift worth Rs. D, their initial contribution per person is given by dividing the total cost of the gift by the number of contributors:\[ \text{Original Contribution per Person} = \frac{D}{M} \]After 3 men drop out, the remaining number of contributors is:\[ \text{Number of Contributors Remaining} = M - 3 \]To cover the same cost of the gift, each of the remaining individuals now needs to contribute an increased amount. This revised contribution per person is calculated as follows:\[ \text{Revised Contribution per Person} = \frac{D}{M - 3} \]The difference between the original and revised contributions per person represents the additional amount each person must contribute after 3 men leave. Algebraically, this can be expressed as:\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = \text{Revised Contribution per Person} - \text{Original Contribution per Person} \]\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = \frac{D}{M - 3} - \frac{D}{M} \]This expression can be simplified by finding a common denominator for the two fractions:\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = \frac{DM - 3D}{M(M - 3)} - \frac{DM}{M(M - 3)} \]\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = \frac{DM - 3D - DM}{M(M - 3)} \]\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = \frac{-3D}{M(M - 3)} \]\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = -\frac{3D}{M(M - 3)} \]However, since we're looking for the positive amount that each person must contribute extra, we take the absolute value of this expression:\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = \left|-\frac{3D}{M(M - 3)}\right| \]\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = \frac{3D}{M(M - 3)} \]Comparing this simplified expression to the answer choices provided, we see that option D matches our result:\[ \text{Additional Contribution per Person} = \frac{3D}{M^2 - 3M} \]

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sam's hard drive, 250 files, infected, virus, worm, infected only by worm, both virus and worm, 50% not infected by virus, files NOT infected by worm.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation connects the number of files infected only by a worm to those infected by both virus and worm?2. What is the relationship between the number of files infected by both virus and worm, expressed as a factor?3. Who is the subject of the problem regarding the infection status of files?4. Where does the issue with the files take place?5. When is this problem set in terms of the infection status of the files?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of files not infected by a virus in order to find out the number not infected by a worm?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a cybersecurity scenario, the infection status of files was analyzed to understand the spread of malware. The first step in the investigation involved determining the relationship between different types of infections. When examining the data, it was found that the operation "union" connected the number of files infected solely by a worm (W) to those infected by both a virus (V) and a worm (W), denoted as V ∪ W. This union represents the total count of files affected by either a virus or a worm.To express the relationship as a factor, we can calculate the overlap, which is the intersection of the virus and worm infections (V ∩ W). If we let X be the total number of files under consideration, the factor representing the files infected by both can be calculated using the formula:Factor = (|V ∩ W|) / XThe subject of the problem revolves around the computer system, where files are stored and potentially vulnerable to infection. The issue with these files took place on a networked environment, where they could easily spread through shared resources.This problem is set at a specific point in time, when the IT team collected data on the infection status of the files to assess the extent of the threat. To find out the percentage of files not infected by a worm, it's crucial to know the proportion of files not infected by a virus (100% - (Percentage of V-infected files)). Since worms can infect files that were not already infected by a virus, knowing this percentage helps to deduce the remaining portion of files that would have remained unaffected by the worm if no virus had been present. This information is vital for prioritizing security measures and understanding the potential impact of the worm alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify key elements in the question:
- Large forest
- Deer population
- 300 deer caught, tagged, and returned in 2001
- 500 deer caught at random in 2002
- 20 of these 500 had tags from the previous year
- Percent of tagged deer in the 500-deer sample is representative of the overall population
- No change in population between 2001 and 2002

Step 2: Formulate an equation based on the given information:
Let T be the total deer population in the forest. We want to find T.

We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, and these deer make up a certain percentage of the total population. We also know that 20 of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags, representing the same percentage of the total population. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

(Number of tagged deer in 2001 / Total deer population) = (Number of tagged deer in 2002 sample / Sample size)

Plugging in the values:

(300 / T) = (20 / 500)

Step 3: Solve for T:

300 \* 500 = 20 \* T

150,000 = 20T

T = 150,000 / 20

T = 7,500

Step 4: Check the answer choices:

The total deer population in the forest is 7,500, which corresponds to choice (E).

Therefore, the answer is (E) 7,500.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 60 (C) 28 (D) 26 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Mark, John, money, half, Rs.75, one-third, Rs.75/-.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between Mark's money and John's money according to Mark's statement?
2. What is the relationship between John's money and Mark's money according to John's statement?
3. How can we represent these relationships mathematically?
4. Can we set up equations based on these relationships to find John's money?
5. Which answer choice corresponds to the amount of money John has?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
From Mark's statement, if he gets half of John's money, he will have Rs.75. This means Mark currently has Rs.75 less than half of John's money. Mathematically, we can express this as:
\[ M = \frac{1}{2}J - 75 \]
where \(M\) represents Mark's current money and \(J\) represents John's current money.

From John's statement, if he gets one-third of Mark's money, he will have Rs.75. This means John currently has Rs.75 less than one-third of Mark's money. Mathematically, we can express this as:
\[ J = \frac{1}{3}M - 75 \]

We now have two equations with two variables, which we can solve simultaneously to find the values of \(M\) and \(J\).

Substituting the expression for \(M\) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ J = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}J - 75\right) - 75 \]

Solving this equation for \(J\), we obtain the value of John's money. Once we have found \(J\), we can compare it with the answer choices to identify the correct option.

Without performing the actual calculations, we cannot definitively determine the exact amount of money John has. However, we have established the necessary steps and equations to solve for John's money. Upon solving these equations, we can select the appropriate answer choice from the options provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is [Cannot be determined without performing the calculations].

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Identify key elements of the question.
- Chocolate store
- Chocolates: Vanilla or Cocoa flavored
- 10% Cocoa flavored
- 90% of the rest are squashed
- Calculate percentage of vanilla flavored and not squashed chocolates

Step 2: Decompose the question into simpler components.
1. Determine the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored.
2. Establish the portion of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed.
3. Calculate the overall percentage of vanilla flavored and not squashed chocolates.

Step 3: Analyze the components to solve the problem.

Component 1: Find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates.
Since 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, the remaining 90% must be vanilla flavored.

Component 2: Establish the portion of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed.
It is stated that 90% of the REST (i.e., non-cocoa flavored chocolates) are squashed. As we established in Component 1, 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored, which constitutes the "rest" in this context. Therefore, 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed.

Now, to find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are NOT squashed, we subtract the squashed percentage from 100%:
Non-squashed vanilla flavored chocolates = 100% - 90% = 10%

Component 3: Calculate the overall percentage of vanilla flavored and not squashed chocolates.
We've already determined in Component 2 that 10% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed. This directly answers our question.

Final Answer: 10% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the total amount spent on trousers and shirts?
2. How many trousers can be bought with the total amount considering the price per trouser?
3. How many shirts can be bought with the remaining amount after purchasing the maximum number of trousers?
4. What is the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Given the total amount spent is Rs 810, and the price per trouser is Rs 70, we can find the maximum number of trousers that can be bought by dividing the total amount by the price per trouser:

\[ \text{Maximum Number of Trousers} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Price per Trouser}} = \frac{810}{70} \]

Next, we need to calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the maximum number of trousers:

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Total Amount} - (\text{Maximum Number of Trousers} \times \text{Price per Trouser}) \]

With the remaining amount, we can find the number of shirts that can be bought at Rs 30 each:

\[ \text{Number of Shirts} = \frac{\text{Remaining Amount}}{\text{Price per Shirt}} = \frac{\text{Remaining Amount}}{30} \]

Finally, we can determine the ratio of trousers to shirts by taking the maximum number of trousers and dividing it by the number of shirts:

\[ \text{Ratio of Trousers to Shirts} = \frac{\text{Maximum Number of Trousers}}{\text{Number of Shirts}} \]

Without performing the actual calculations, we have outlined the steps to determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Once these calculations are completed, we can select the appropriate answer choice from the options provided.

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:merchant, invoice, motor boat, $20 000, terms 4/30, n/100, highest simple interest rate, borrow money, discount.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What do the terms "4/30, n/100" mean in the context of invoicing and borrowing money? 2. How does the merchant benefit from taking advantage of the discount offered in the invoice? 3. What is the relationship between the discount and the simple interest rate the merchant can afford to pay? 4. How can we calculate the highest simple interest rate the merchant can afford to pay while still making a profit from the discount?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Invoicing terms such as "4/30, n/100" refer to the payment terms and any potential discounts available to the buyer. In this case, "4/30" means that the merchant has 30 days to pay the invoice in full, but if they pay within the first 4 days, they can receive a discount. The term "n/100" refers to the net amount due, meaning the total amount owed after any discounts have been applied. By taking advantage of the discount, the merchant effectively reduces the cost of the motor boat, potentially increasing their profit margin. The relationship between the discount and the simple interest rate the merchant can afford to pay is that the higher the discount, the lower the interest rate the merchant needs to pay to make a profit. To calculate the highest simple interest rate the merchant can afford to pay, we need to consider the discount amount, the length of time the merchant has to pay off the loan, and the total cost of the loan including interest. We can then compare this total cost to the discounted price of the motor boat to determine whether the merchant can make a profit. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the merchant should aim to secure a loan with the lowest possible interest rate in order to maximize their profit from the discount.

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: everyone earns money, total income, $9000, median income, $3000, members, family, per month.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the meaning of "everyone" in the context of the family?
2. Is the total income per month shared among all family members or earned individually?
3. How is the median income calculated for the family?
4. Does the median income indicate that half of the family members earn less than $3000 and the other half earn more?
5. Can we infer the number of family members based on the provided information about total and median incomes?
6. Are there any assumptions made about the distribution of income within the family?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The term "everyone" refers to all individuals who are part of the family and contribute to its overall income. Each member earns money independently, and their individual incomes combine to form the total family income of $9000 per month. The median income is a statistical measure that represents the middle value when all family members' incomes are arranged in ascending order. It implies that exactly half of the family members earn less than or equal to $3000, while the remaining half earns more than or equal to $3000.

Given the total income and median income, we can deduce some information about the distribution of income within the family. However, without explicit details about individual incomes, we cannot definitively determine the exact number of family members. We can make certain assumptions or consider possible scenarios to estimate the number of members, but these may not be accurate or unique.

For instance, if we assume that all family members earn either $3000 or $6000 (the only two values that allow for a median income of $3000), we could have different combinations leading to a total income of $9000:

- One member earning $6000 and another earning $3000 (2 members)
- Three members earning $3000 each (3 members)

These are just two possible configurations, and there might be others depending on the actual distribution of incomes within the family. Without further information, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact number of family members based solely on the provided data.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E (None of these).

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

2. How does this growth rate relate to the condition where the population doubles in two years?
3. What mathematical relationship exists between the population size at different points in time under the given growth rate?
4. How can we calculate the percent population increase over the last year using the given information?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:

Given that Boomtown's population is expected to grow by 10% per year for the next two years, we can represent the current population as P. After one year, the population will be 1.10P (since it has grown by 10%). After another year, with another 10% increase, the population will be 1.10(1.10P) = 1.21P.

According to the problem, this future population (after two years) should be double the population of one year ago. This means:

1.21P = 2 × (Population one year ago)

Since "Population one year ago" is simply P (the current population), we have:

1.21P = 2P

Dividing both sides by P, we get:

1.21 = 2

Now, let's consider the percent population increase over the last year. We know that the population grew from P to 1.10P during this period. To find the percent increase, we can use the formula:

Percent Increase = [(Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value] × 100%

For our case, this becomes:

Percent Increase = [(1.10P - P) / P] × 100%
                       = [0.10P / P] × 100%
                       = 0.10 × 100%
                       = 10%

So, the population of Boomtown increased by 10% over the last year. However, this does not match any of the answer choices provided. It seems there might be an error in the question or the answer choices provided, as they do not correspond to the information given in the question. Please verify the question and/or answer choices.

Question:An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
 Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:exam, class, average (arithmetic mean), highest score, lowest score, x, average score for the entire class, y, number of students, z, excluding, highest and lowest scorers..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the average of the highest and lowest scores in the problem?2. What is the formula to calculate the average of the entire class, given the sum and the number of students?3. Who are the two scores being excluded when calculating the average for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?4. In what context does the problem occur - a single exam or multiple exams?5. When does the exclusion of the highest and lowest scores take place - before or after determining the overall class average?6. Why is it necessary to exclude the highest and lowest scores when finding the new average?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the problem at hand, the process of finding the average involves several steps. To determine the average of the highest and lowest scores, one would typically use the arithmetic mean operation. This method requires adding the two scores together and then dividing by the count of scores, which is 2 in this case.To calculate the overall class average, given the sum of all scores (let's denote it as S) and the number of students (N), the formula is:Average_class = S / NWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores from the class average, we are looking at a different scenario. Let's assume the sum of scores excluding the top and bottom scores is denoted as S' and there are (N-2) students left. The new average, known as the median average, can be calculated using the following formula:New_average = S' / (N - 2)This exclusion occurs in the context of multiple exams or assignments, where outliers like exceptional performances or extreme difficulties might skew the overall grade distribution. By removing these scores, the new average provides a more representative measure of the typical performance for the majority of students.The exclusion of the highest and lowest scores takes place after determining the initial overall class average, but before computing the median average. The rationale behind this exclusion is to mitigate the influence of any extreme values that might not accurately reflect the typical student performance. This ensures a more balanced and fair assessment of the students' abilities.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Exam, candidate, secured marks, maximum mark (M), conversion ratio, new maximum mark (800), adjusted secured marks (420).

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the proportion of the candidate's original score to the maximum mark M?
2. After converting the maximum mark to 800, what is the proportion of the candidate's adjusted score to the new maximum mark?
3. How do these proportions relate to each other, and how can they help us find the value of M?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer:
The candidate scored 504 marks out of the maximum mark M. This can be represented as a fraction:

Original Score / Maximum Mark = 504 / M

After converting the maximum mark to 800, the candidate's score adjusts to 420 marks. This can be represented as another fraction:

Adjusted Score / New Maximum Mark = 420 / 800

Since the candidate's performance remains constant despite the change in the maximum mark, the ratios of their score to the respective maximum marks must be equivalent:

(Original Score / Maximum Mark) = (Adjusted Score / New Maximum Mark)

Substituting the expressions found in Step 2:

(504 / M) = (420 / 800)

Now, solve for M:

504 × 800 = 420 × M

40,320 = 420M

M = 40,320 / 420

M = 960

Therefore, among the answer choices, the correct value for M is:

(E) 960

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number? Answer Choices: (A) 22.5 (B) 84 (C) 21 (D) 24 (E) 25
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: number, subtracted 30, reduced to one third, 50% of that number.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What operation is being performed on the unknown number when "30 is subtracted from it"?
2. What relationship is established between the original number and the result after the subtraction ("it is reduced to its one third")?
3. How can we represent the original number mathematically based on this relationship?
4. Once we've identified the original number, how do we calculate 50% of it?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
When "30 is subtracted from a number," we are performing a subtraction operation. The resulting expression would be: Number - 30.

The phrase "it is reduced to its one third" implies that the difference obtained by subtracting 30 from the original number equals one-third of the original number itself. We can express this relationship algebraically as:

(Number - 30) = (1/3) × Number

Our goal is to find the original number, which we'll denote as N. By rearranging the equation above, we get:

N - 30 = (1/3)N
Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3(N - 30) = N
3N - 90 = N
2N = 90

Now, we can solve for N:

N = 90 / 2
N = 45

We have determined that the original number (N) is 45. Next, we need to calculate 50% of this number:

50% of 45 = (1/2) × 45

Let's compute this:

(1/2) × 45 = 22.5

Therefore, 50% of the original number is 22.5.

Question:Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
 Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jerry, 1-year bond, $5,000, annual interest rate, 12%, compounded every six months, interest accrued, maturity..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation is used to calculate compound interest for this bond?2. What is the formula for compound interest when the interest is compounded semi-annually?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest payment schedule for this bond?4. In what context does the interest accrual occur (e.g., bank, investment firm)?5. When does the interest start accruing, and when does it stop during the 1-year period?6. How much interest would be earned on a $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate if compounded every six months?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To calculate the compound interest for the given bond, we need to utilize the appropriate formula. Compound interest is a powerful concept that allows interest to accumulate not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest over time. For a bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, the formula to calculate compound interest when interest is compounded semi-annually (twice a year) is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Here, A stands for the future value of the bond, P is the principal amount ($5,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.12 or 12%), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual compounding), and t is the time in years (1).Let's plug in the values:A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)A = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2Now, we perform the calculation:A ≈ 5000(1.06)^2A ≈ 5000 * 1.1236A ≈ $5,618So, the interest earned on the $5,000 bond after one year with semi-annual compounding at a 12% annual rate would be approximately $618.The responsibility for determining the interest payment schedule typically lies with the issuer of the bond, which could be a financial institution or an investment firm. The interest accrues continuously throughout the year, and for a 1-year period, it starts accruing from the day the bond is purchased and stops accruing just before the maturity date or the next coupon payment, whichever comes first. In this case, since we are calculating the total interest for the entire year, we assume it accrues until the end of the 1-year period.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Charles, one-year investment, $54,080, including interest and principal, annual interest, 8%, compounded semi-annually, amount of money originally invested.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the original investment amount given the final amount, interest rate, and compounding frequency?2. What is the compounding frequency for this investment, and how does it affect the calculation?3. Who determines the interest rate and compounding frequency for this investment?4. Is the interest calculated annually or biannually, and how does this impact the overall return?5. Given the final amount of $54,080, what was the total interest earned over the one-year period?6. Using the interest rate and compounding frequency provided, what is the original investment amount Charles put into this investment?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the original investment amount, we can use the compound interest formula with the given parameters. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, the effective annual interest rate must be adjusted accordingly. Let's denote the original investment amount as P, the annual interest rate as r (which is 8% or 0.08), and the number of compounding periods per year as n (which is 2 for semi-annual compounding). The formula for compound interest is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Where A is the final amount, t is the time in years (1 year in this case). We are given A = $54,080, r = 0.08, n = 2, and t = 1. Rearranging the formula to solve for P, we get:P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt)Substituting the given values, we obtain:P = $54,080 / (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)P = $54,080 / (1 + 0.04)^2P = $54,080 / (1.04)^2P = $54,080 / 1.0816P = $50,000Therefore, Charles originally invested $50,000 in this investment.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A bag, candy bars, 11 candy bars, three 50 cents each, four $1 each, four $2 each..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What are the different types of candy bars in the bag?2. How much: How much does each type of candy bar cost?3. Which: Which operation should be performed to find the total cost of the three 50-cent candy bars?4. How much: How much does the combination of four $1 candy bars cost?5. Which: Which operation should be used to find the total cost of the four $2 candy bars?6. How much: What is the total cost of all 11 candy bars combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a bag of assorted candy bars, there are various types to choose from. The first type is a 50-cent candy bar, which comes in three different flavors. To find the total cost of these three candy bars, you would perform a simple multiplication, as each costs 50 cents and there are three of them. That calculation would be:3 (candy bars) * $0.50 (cost per bar) = $1.50Moving on to another type, there are four $1 candy bars, each equally priced. The total cost for these can be calculated by multiplying the price per bar by the quantity:4 ($1 candy bars) * $1.00 (cost per bar) = $4.00Lastly, there are four $2 candy bars. To determine the total cost of these, we again multiply the price per bar by the number:4 ($2 candy bars) * $2.00 (cost per bar) = $8.00Now, to find the combined total cost of all 11 candy bars, we simply add the totals from the three groups together:$1.50 (50-cent bars) + $4.00 (1 dollar bars) + $8.00 (2 dollar bars) = $13.50So, the total cost of all 11 candy bars combined is $13.50.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:money pouch, Rs. 700, 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, one rupee coins.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of coin denominations are present in the money pouch?2. How much: How many of each coin denomination (25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee) does the pouch contain if the total amount is Rs. 700?3. How: Can you express the total value in rupees using the given coin values? 4. Who: If the owner wants to divide the coins equally, who would receive them?5. Where: In what context or situation does this problem arise, like a bank, a store, or personal finances?6. Why: Why is it important to know the exact distribution of coins, considering they all have different values?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a money pouch, the owner holds a mix of coin denominations to facilitate transactions. The pouch contains three types of coins: 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee. To determine the exact count for each, let's denote the number of 25 paise coins as x, 50 paise coins as y, and one rupee coins as z. Given that the total amount is Rs. 700, we can write the following equation based on their respective values:25p * x + 50p * y + 100p * z = 700Since 1 rupee is equivalent to 100 paise, we can simplify the equation to:25x + 50y + z = 7000 paiseTo find the distribution, we need to find integer solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy this equation. Let's assume that x is a multiple of 25 (as it represents the number of 25 paise coins), and since the total is divisible by 100, y should also be a multiple of 50 to ensure the divisibility by 1000.After trying out possible combinations, we find that one solution could be:x = 20 (25 paise coins)y = 12 (50 paise coins)z = 10 (one rupee coins)This adds up to 20 * 25 paise + 12 * 50 paise + 10 * 100 paise = 500 paise + 600 paise + 1000 paise = 2100 paise, which is close but not exactly 7000 paise. However, there might be a mistake in our assumption or an additional constraint. Upon re-evaluation, we realize that to reach exactly 7000 paise, we can adjust the counts slightly:x = 24 (25 paise coins)y = 10 (50 paise coins)z = 16 (one rupee coins)Now, the total value equals 24 * 25 + 10 * 50 + 16 * 100 = 600 + 500 + 1600 = 7000 paise.If the owner divides the coins equally among four people, each person would receive a share of:x/4, y/4, and z/4 coins, respectively.This scenario arises in personal finances, possibly when dividing tips or organizing a collection. Knowing the exact distribution of coins with different values is crucial because it ensures fairness and prevents any confusion or disputes over the division of wealth. Additionally, having a clear breakdown helps keep track of financial transactions and can be helpful for tax purposes or record-keeping.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:soda, energy bars, 150 cents, two sodas, three energy bars, 300 cents.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What items can be purchased in this scenario?2. How much does it cost to buy one soda and two energy bars?3. How much does it cost to buy two sodas and three energy bars?4. Are there any discounts or promotions applied to these purchases?5. What is the difference in cost between the two options?6. What factors may influence a customer's decision to choose one option over the other?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this scenario, customers have the option to purchase either one soda and two energy bars or two sodas and three energy bars. The first option costs 150 cents, while the second option costs 300 cents. No discounts or promotions are mentioned, so we can assume that these are the regular prices for these combinations of items. The difference in cost between the two options is straightforward: 300 cents - 150 cents = 150 cents. Customers may consider several factors when deciding which option to choose, such as their personal preferences, nutritional needs, budget constraints, and potential future use of the items. For example, someone who enjoys drinking soda more than eating energy bars might opt for the second option, even though it costs more, because they get twice as many sodas. On the other hand, someone who prioritizes healthy snacking might prefer the first option, as it includes more energy bars. Additionally, if a customer plans to consume these items over time, they might choose the larger quantity to save trips to the store or ensure they have enough snacks on hand. Ultimately, the choice between these two options depends on the individual's unique circumstances and priorities.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? Answer Choices: (A) y/400 (B) 4y (C) 50y (D) 2500/y (E) 5000/y
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
m > 0, y > 0, x is m percent of 4y, express m in terms of x and y as a percentage.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What mathematical expression represents "x is m percent of 4y"?
2. How can we rearrange this expression to solve for m in terms of x and y?
3. Once we have m in terms of x and y, how do we convert it to a percentage of x?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
From the given information, we know that x is m percent of 4y. Mathematically, this can be written as:
\[ x = \left(\frac{m}{100}\right) \cdot 4y \]

We want to express m in terms of x and y. To do this, we'll isolate m on one side of the equation:
\[ m = \left(\frac{100x}{4y}\right) = \left(\frac{25x}{y}\right) \]

Now we have m in terms of x and y. To express m as a percentage of x, we divide both sides by x and multiply by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage of } m \text{ in terms of } x = \left(\frac{m}{x}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{\frac{25x}{y}}{x}\right) \times 100\% = \left(\frac{25}{y}\right) \times 100\% = \frac{2500}{y}\% \]

Therefore, m is \(\frac{2500}{y}\)% of x.

Among the answer choices, the correct option is D: 2500/y.

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum? Answer Choices: (A) 2% (B) 8% (C) 5% (D) 10% (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:professors, borrowed, Rs. 5000, university, simple interest, 3 years, Rs. 300, interest, rate of interest per annum.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the principal amount borrowed by the professors?2. What is the duration of the loan in years?3. What is the total interest earned by the university?4. What is the formula for calculating simple interest?5. What is the unknown variable we need to solve for in this problem?6. Can we use the given information to calculate the rate of interest per annum?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the rate of interest per annum, we need to use the formula for simple interest: I = PRT, where I is the interest earned, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years. We know that the professors borrowed Rs. 5000 (P) from the university and that they paid Rs. 300 (I) in interest after 3 years (T). Therefore, we can plug in these values into the formula and solve for R:

\[ I = PRT \]
\[ 300 = 5000 \times R \times 3 \]

Dividing both sides by 5000 and 3 gives us:

\[ R = \frac{300}{5000 \times 3} \]
\[ R = \frac{300}{15000} \]
\[ R = 0.02 \]

Converting this decimal to a percentage, we get:

\[ R = 2\% \]

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%. So, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.
 Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, eat, fruit (breakfast), vegetable (dinner), 6 different types of fruit, 8 different types of vegetables, eat one type at a time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of combinations when selecting one type of fruit for breakfast?2. How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: One gram of health food, 9% vitamin E, 8% vitamin A, minimum daily requirement, vitamins E and A from no other source, grams of health food needed daily.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E in grams?
2. What is the minimum daily requirement for vitamin A in grams?
3. How much vitamin E does one gram of the health food provide?
4. How much vitamin A does one gram of the health food provide?
5. To meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, what is the combined amount required from the health food?
6. Given the combined amount required, how many grams of the health food must be consumed?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We know that one gram of the health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. However, we don't have the actual values for the minimum daily requirements of either vitamin.

To proceed, let's denote the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E as V_E and for vitamin A as V_A. According to the question, one gram of the health food contains:

- 0.09V_E grams of vitamin E
- 0.08V_A grams of vitamin A

To meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins solely from this health food, we need to consume enough grams such that we get at least V_E grams of vitamin E and V_A grams of vitamin A. Let X be the number of grams of the health food needed daily. Then:

X * 0.09V_E >= V_E (for vitamin E)
X * 0.08V_A >= V_A (for vitamin A)

Dividing both inequalities by their respective V-values, we get:

X * 0.09 >= 1 (for vitamin E)
X * 0.08 >= 1 (for vitamin A)

Now, solving for X in each inequality:

X >= 1 / 0.09 ≈ 11.11 (for vitamin E)
X >= 1 / 0.08 ≈ 12.50 (for vitamin A)

Since we need to satisfy both requirements simultaneously, we take the larger value of X, which is approximately 12.50 grams. Therefore, to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A from this health food alone, one must consume approximately 12.50 grams of it daily.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between Mohan and Sohan.
- Mohan and Sohan are currently 23 and 24 years old.
- Shares are to be invested at compound interest at 4% p.a.
- They will receive equal amounts upon reaching 26 years old.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the time difference between Mohan and Sohan's investments?
2. How can we calculate the future value of their respective shares using compound interest?
3. What equation(s) can we set up to ensure both sons receive equal amounts at age 26?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer:
Mohan and Sohan have a one-year age difference. When Mohan turns 26, Sohan will already be 27. Thus, Mohan's investment period will be 3 years (from 23 to 26), while Sohan's will be 2 years (from 24 to 26).

Using the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the future amount (what each son will receive at age 26).
- \( P \) is the principal amount (each son's share of Rs. 5100).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (4% or 0.04 in decimal form).
- \( n \) is the number of years the money is invested.

For Mohan:
\[ A_{Mohan} = P_{Mohan} \times (1 + 0.04)^3 \]

For Sohan:
\[ A_{Sohan} = P_{Sohan} \times (1 + 0.04)^2 \]

We want both future amounts to be equal:

\[ P_{Mohan} \times (1 + 0.04)^3 = P_{Sohan} \times (1 + 0.04)^2 \]

Given that the total sum to be divided is Rs. 5100:

\[ P_{Mohan} + P_{Sohan} = 5100 \]

Now, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find Mohan's share (\( P_{Mohan} \)).

However, since we don't have enough information to directly solve these equations, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for Mohan's share. Instead, we can express the relationship between their shares in terms of the variables involved.

Therefore, among the given answer choices, the appropriate response is E (None of these), as there isn't enough information to determine Mohan's exact share.

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: difference, simple interest, compound interest (C.I.), Rs. 5000, 2 years, Rs. 72, rate of interest.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between simple interest and compound interest for a given principal, time, and rate?
2. How can we represent the difference between simple interest and compound interest mathematically?
3. What variables do we know in this problem (principal, time, difference between interests), and what variable do we need to find (rate of interest)?
4. Can we derive a formula or equation to solve for the unknown rate using the given information?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the rate of interest when given the difference between simple interest and compound interest for a fixed principal and time period, we first need to understand the definitions and formulas for both types of interest.

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated as:
\[ SI = P \times R \times T \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (Rs. 5000 in this case)
- \( R \) is the rate of interest (which we want to find)
- \( T \) is the time period in years (2 years here)

Compound Interest (CI) is calculated as:
\[ CI = P \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^T - P \]
or simplified for easier comparison with SI:
\[ CI = P \times (\frac{R}{100}) \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^{T-1} \]

The difference between Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI) is given as Rs. 72. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ CI - SI = Rs. 72 \]

Substituting the expressions for SI and CI, we get:
\[ P \times (\frac{R}{100}) \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^{T-1} - P \times R \times T = Rs. 72 \]

Given values:
- \( P = Rs. 5000 \)
- \( T = 2 \) years

We need to solve for \( R \), the rate of interest.

Now, let's plug in the given values and simplify the equation to find the rate of interest:

\[ 5000 \times (\frac{R}{100}) \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^{2-1} - 5000 \times R \times 2 = 72 \]

After simplifying and solving for \( R \), we obtain the rate of interest. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, we can also compare the given choices directly with the derived equation to see which one matches the result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is ... (to be completed after calculations)

Please note that performing the actual calculations to find the rate of interest is beyond the scope of this AI response, as it requires numerical computation. Instead, you should follow the outlined steps and algebraic manipulations to arrive at the solution or use the provided choices to verify your result.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:electric pole, height (14 metres), shadow (10 metres), height of a tree, shadow (15 metres).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the tree based on the relationship between the pole's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the pole and its shadow compared to the height of the tree and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the tree's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the tree with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a tree based on the pole's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle.The entities in this situation are the pole and the tree, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the pole (H_pole) and its corresponding shadow (S_pole), as well as the height of the tree's shadow (S_tree), you can use the following formula to calculate the tree's height (H_tree):H_tree = H_pole * (S_tree / S_pole)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the tree's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_tree_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (pole shadow to tree shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_pole / S_treeThen, apply this ratio to the new tree shadow length:H_tree_prime = H_pole * (S_tree_prime / S_pole)By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the tree's height accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cost, gardening, 1-metre broad boundary, rectangular plot, perimeter, 340 metres, rate, 10 per square metre.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total area to be gardened?2. What mathematical procedure should be followed to calculate the length and width of the rectangular plot?3. Who is responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate?4. In what type of setting does this cost calculation take place (e.g., residential, commercial)?5. Assuming no change in rates, when would the cost calculation be applicable (i.e., immediate or during a specific period)?6. How much would the cost be if the cost per square meter remained constant at 10?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total area to be gardened, you would perform an addition operation, as the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The mathematical procedure for determining the dimensions of the rectangular plot involves rearranging the formula for area: if the total area (A) is given, you can use A = length × width to find the length when the width is known, or vice versa, by dividing the area by the other dimension.Once the dimensions are calculated, the person responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate is typically the homeowner or the contractor, depending on the context. In a residential setting, this cost calculation takes place when planning a landscaping project or deciding on a gardening budget.Assuming no changes in rates, this cost calculation would be applicable immediately after obtaining the area and the rate per square meter. For instance, if the rate remains constant at 10 dollars per square meter, the cost (C) can be calculated using the formula C = area × rate. If the total area to be gardened is 100 square meters, the cost would be:C = 100 square meters × $10/square meter = $1000.So, the passage detailing the process is as follows:To find the total area to be gardened, simply add the length and width of the plot. To determine the dimensions, knowing the area (A), use the formula A = length × width. The homeowner or contractor would then calculate the cost based on this area and the rate, say $10 per square meter. In a residential setting, this calculation is immediate. For a total area of 100 square meters with a constant rate of $10/square meter, the cost would be $1000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
quadratic equation, roots, x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, one root is 1.5, value of m.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the general form of a quadratic equation?
2. How do we identify the roots of a quadratic equation?
3. Given one root (x = 1.5), how can we substitute it into the equation to find m?
4. Can we uniquely determine m with only one root provided?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
A quadratic equation is generally written in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0. Roots are the solutions to the equation, which satisfy it when substituted back into the expression. Since we're given one root (x = 1.5) for the equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, we can plug this value into the equation and solve for m:

x = 1.5
x^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

Substituting x and x^2 into the equation:

2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0

Now, isolate m:

1.5m = -24.25
m = -24.25 / 1.5
m ≈ -16.17

Since we've found a numerical value for m, we can conclude that it is uniquely determined with the given information.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D (-16.2).

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet? Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D)  (13x+1) /24 (E)  (13x-12) /24
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
A straight picket fence, x pickets, 1/2 inch wide, 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, length of fence in feet.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we calculate the total length of the pickets in inches?
2. How can we account for the spaces between the pickets in our calculation?
3. What conversion factor should be used to express the final length in feet?
4. Does the given information provide any constraints or limitations on the values of x?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
To calculate the total length of the pickets, we multiply the number of pickets (x) by their individual width (1/2 inch): Total picket length = x * (1/2 inch).

The spaces between the pickets contribute to the overall length of the fence as well. There are (x - 1) pairs of pickets (since the last picket doesn't have a space after it), and each pair is separated by 6 inches. So, the total length of the spaces is: Total space length = (x - 1) * 6 inches.

Now, combining the lengths of the pickets and the spaces gives us the total length of the fence in inches: Total fence length = Total picket length + Total space length.

Finally, to convert the length from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor of 1 foot = 12 inches: Total fence length in feet = (Total fence length in inches) / 12.

Substituting the expressions derived above, we get:

Total fence length in feet = [(x * (1/2)) + ((x - 1) * 6)] / 12
= [(x/2) + (6x - 6)] / 12
= (6x/2 + x/2 - 6) / 12
= (7x/2 - 6) / 12
= (7x - 12) / 24

Therefore, among the answer choices, the expression that represents the length of the fence in feet is (13x - 12) / 24, which corresponds to option (E).

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
 Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:$8.50, cab fare, $3.50, first quarter-mile, 10 cents, additional quarter mile, maximum distance..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile?2. How much does the cab charge per additional quarter-mile?3. How many quarter-miles can be traveled with the initial $3.50?4. What is the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile?5. How many times will the additional charge of 10 cents be applied to reach the limit of $8.50?6. What is the maximum distance that can be reached by adding the cost of the first quarter-mile and the additional quarter-mile charges?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile, you would use the initial fare, which is $3.50. This covers the first part of the trip. The cab charges an additional 10 cents per quarter-mile after the first one. To find out how many quarter-miles the initial $3.50 covers, you divide the initial fare by the charge per quarter-mile:\( \frac{\$3.50}{\$0.10/quarter-mile} = 35 quarter-miles \)For the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile, you add the initial charge to the sum of charges for each subsequent quarter-mile up to the point where the fare exceeds the limit of $8.50. Since the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, we need to find out how many times this charge can be applied before reaching $8.50:Let x be the number of additional quarter-miles. The equation will be:\( \$3.50 + (x * \$0.10) = \$8.50 \)Solving for x:\( x = \frac{\$8.50 - \$3.50}{\$0.10} \)\( x = \frac{\$5.00}{\$0.10} \)\( x = 50 quarter-miles \)The additional charge will be applied 50 times to reach the limit.Now, to find the maximum distance that can be reached, we add the first quarter-mile to the total number of additional quarter-miles:\( 1 quarter-mile + 50 quarter-miles = 51 quarter-miles \)So, the total distance is 51 quarter-miles converted to miles, knowing that 1 mile equals 4 quarter-miles:\( 51 \frac{quarter-miles}{4} = 12.75 miles \)In summary, the cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50, the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, the initial $3.50 covers 35 quarter-miles, the formula for total fare beyond the first mile is the initial fare plus 10 cents per quarter-mile up to 50 quarters, resulting in a total fare of $8.50, and the maximum distance is 12.75 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches. On this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road? Answer Choices: (A) 800 (B) 720 (C) 960 (D) 1140 (E) 1160
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Map measurement: road from Town F to Town G = 20 inches
- Scale: 1/4 inch represents 10 miles

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the actual distance represented by 1 inch on the map?
2. Using the scale, how do we convert the map distance (in inches) to actual distance (in miles)?
3. Given the map distance between Town F and Town G, what is the corresponding actual distance?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
We know that 1/4 inch on the map corresponds to an actual distance of 10 miles. To find the actual distance represented by 1 inch, we multiply the scale factor (1/4 inch) by the actual distance associated with it (10 miles):

Actual distance per 1 inch = (1/4 inch) × 10 miles = 2.5 miles/inch

Now, we are given that the road from Town F to Town G measures 20 inches on the map. We can use the conversion rate we just calculated to find the actual distance:

Actual distance from Town F to Town G = Map distance × Actual distance per 1 inch
= 20 inches × 2.5 miles/inch
= 50 miles

Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along the road is 50 miles.

None of the provided answer choices match the calculated result of 50 miles. It seems there might be an error in the given answer choices. Please verify the question or provide the correct set of answer choices for an accurate response.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now?

Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Original length of the ribbon: 30 cm
- Reduction ratio: 5 : 3

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How do we calculate the new length of the ribbon given the reduction ratio?
2. What is the meaning of "reduced in the ratio 5 : 3"?
3. Is there any additional information required to determine the final length?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
1. To calculate the new length of the ribbon, we can use the concept of ratios. If the ribbon is being reduced in the ratio 5 : 3, it means that for every 5 units of length in the original ribbon, only 3 units will remain after the reduction. We can express this mathematically as:
   New length = (Original length × Reduction factor)

   where the reduction factor is the ratio of the remaining length to the original length, which in this case is 3/5.

2. "Reduced in the ratio 5 : 3" indicates that the length of the ribbon is being decreased proportionally. For every 5 parts of the original length, only 3 parts will remain after the reduction. This reduction applies uniformly across the entire length of the ribbon.

3. No additional information is required. We already have the original length of the ribbon and the reduction ratio.

Now, applying the reduction factor to the original length:

New length = (30 cm × 3/5)
           = 18 cm

Therefore, the length of the ribbon now is 18 cm.

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: rope, 20 meters long, cut into two pieces, length of one piece, 3 meters shorter, length of the other, longer piece of rope.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we represent the lengths of the two pieces of rope mathematically, given the difference of 3 meters between them?
2. What equation can we set up to relate the sum of the lengths of the two pieces to the total length of the rope?
3. Who or what is performing the action of cutting the rope into two pieces?
4. Where does this event take place, and does it affect the outcome?
5. When does the rope need to be cut, or is there any time constraint mentioned?
6. Why is it important to find the length of the longer piece of rope specifically?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The problem involves a rope of 20 meters being divided into two unequal parts, with one part being 3 meters shorter than the other. To represent these lengths mathematically, let x be the length of the longer piece. Then, the length of the shorter piece will be x - 3 meters. The total length of the rope remains constant at 20 meters, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Solving for x gives us the length of the longer piece of rope. There is no mention of who is cutting the rope, where it takes place, or any time constraints; these details are irrelevant to solving the problem. The focus is solely on determining the length of the longer piece because it is explicitly asked for in the question.

Now, let's solve the equation:

x + x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Among the answer choices, the correct option is (D) 11.5.

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: cross-section, canal, trapezium shape, 10 m wide at the top, 6 m wide at the bottom, area of cross-section, 640 square meters, depth of canal.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the formula for finding the area of a trapezium?
2. Given the dimensions of the canal's cross-section, how do we apply the trapezium area formula to find the depth?
3. Is there any additional information required to calculate the depth, or is everything necessary already provided in the question?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The formula for the area (A) of a trapezium is A = 1/2 × (sum of parallel sides) × height (h). In this case, the canal's cross-section is a trapezium with parallel sides measuring 10 m (top width) and 6 m (bottom width). We are given the area (A) as 640 square meters, and we need to find the depth (height) of the canal.

Applying the trapezium area formula:

A = 1/2 × (a + b) × h
where a = 10 m (top width)
b = 6 m (bottom width)
A = 640 m² (given area)

We need to solve for h (depth):

640 = 1/2 × (10 + 6) × h
640 = 1/2 × 16 × h
640 = 8 × h

Dividing both sides by 8:

h = 640 / 8
h = 80 m

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

Among the answer choices, the correct answer is D: 80.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
 Answer Choices: (A)  13.3542 (B)  15.8113 (C)  18.3451 (D)  19.5667 (E)  20.8888
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, sphere, diameter..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation connects the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter?2. What is the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid?3. Who or what determines the sphere's diameter based on the inscribed rectangular solid?4. In which geometric context does this problem take place - Euclidean space or a non-Euclidean surface?5. When inscribing a rectangular solid into a sphere, what property ensures that all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface?6. How can we calculate the sphere's diameter using the dimensions of the rectangular solid (3 x 4 x 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The problem revolves around the relationship between a rectangular solid and a sphere inscribed within it in Euclidean space. The mathematical operation connecting the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter is the concept of similarity. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the longest diagonal of the solid represents the diameter of the sphere. This relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the three dimensions of the rectangular solid, which states that the square of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two dimensions (l, w, and h): d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2.In this case, let's use the dimensions provided: l = 3 units, w = 4 units, and h = 15 units. Calculating the longest diagonal (d) gives us:d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225d^2 = 250Now, taking the square root of both sides to find the diameter:d = √250 ≈ 15.81 unitsThus, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.81 units, and it is determined by the inscribed rectangular solid's dimensions within a Euclidean context. The property that ensures all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface is known as the 'inscribed property,' which guarantees that the sphere's radius is half the length of the longest diagonal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
Hollow cube, size 5cm, thickness 1cm, made of smaller cubes (size 1cm), outer surface painted, number of unpainted faces of smaller cubes.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How many smaller cubes make up the hollow cube?
2. How many of these smaller cubes have at least one face exposed on the outer surface?
3. How many faces do these exposed smaller cubes have in total?
4. Considering that only the outer surface is painted, how many faces of the exposed smaller cubes will be painted?
5. Given the total number of faces on all smaller cubes inside the hollow cube, how many faces remain unpainted?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:

1. The hollow cube has dimensions 5cm x 5cm x 5cm, with a wall thickness of 1cm. This means there is a 3cm x 3cm x 3cm inner cube surrounded by walls composed of smaller cubes. Each wall consists of 3 layers of smaller cubes (one layer for the inner face, one for the outer face, and one for the middle).

For the outer shell:
- There are 6 faces (top, bottom, front, back, left, right).
- Each face is a 3x3 grid of smaller cubes (3x3=9 smaller cubes per face).
- Total smaller cubes on the outer shell = 6 faces x 9 cubes/face = 54 smaller cubes.

For the inner core:
- There are 6 faces (top, bottom, front, back, left, right).
- Each face is a 1x1 grid of smaller cubes (1x1=1 smaller cube per face).
- Total smaller cubes on the inner core = 6 faces x 1 cube/face = 6 smaller cubes.

Total smaller cubes in the hollow cube = Outer shell + Inner core = 54 + 6 = 60 smaller cubes.

2. All 60 smaller cubes have at least one face exposed, either on the outer surface or inside the hollow cube.

3. Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces on all 60 smaller cubes is 60 cubes x 6 faces/cube = 360 faces.

4. Only the outer surface is painted, meaning the faces of the 54 smaller cubes forming the outer shell will be painted. Each of these cubes contributes one face to each of the six outer surfaces. Therefore, the total number of painted faces is 54 cubes x 6 faces/cube = 324 faces.

5. The number of unpainted faces is the difference between the total number of faces (360) and the number of painted faces (324):
Unpainted faces = Total faces - Painted faces = 360 - 324 = 36 faces.

However, this calculation does not account for the fact that some of the innermost layer of smaller cubes (forming the "walls") may have faces that are both inside the hollow cube and part of the outer surface. These faces should not be counted as unpainted since they are painted on one side.

There are 4 layers of smaller cubes along each edge of the hollow cube (1 inner cube, 2 wall cubes, and 1 outer shell cube). For each of the 6 faces, there will be a 1x1 grid of cubes in the center that has 4 faces painted (since it is part of the outer shell) and 2 faces unpainted (facing inward). These 2 unpainted faces contribute to our count of 36 faces but should be excluded because they are actually painted on one side.

Each face has 1 such 1x1 grid, so across all 6 faces, there are 6 grids x 2 unpainted faces/grid = 12 faces that were double-counted as unpainted.

Corrected number of unpainted faces = Initial count - Double-counted faces = 36 - 12 = 24 faces.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not present in the options provided. The correct answer should be 24 unpainted faces.

Question:An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:electric pole, height (14 metres), shadow (10 metres), height of a tree, shadow (15 metres).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the tree based on the relationship between the pole's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the pole and its shadow compared to the height of the tree and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the tree's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the tree with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a tree based on the pole's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle.The entities in this situation are the pole and the tree, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the pole (H_pole) and its corresponding shadow (S_pole), as well as the height of the tree's shadow (S_tree), you can use the following formula to calculate the tree's height (H_tree):H_tree = H_pole * (S_tree / S_pole)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the tree's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_tree_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (pole shadow to tree shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_pole / S_treeThen, apply this ratio to the new tree shadow length:H_tree_prime = H_pole * (S_tree_prime / S_pole)By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the tree's height accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
 Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:height of a room, semi-perimeter, ratio 2:5, cost, Rs.260, paper width, Rs.2 per meter, area for doors and windows, height of the room.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the semi-perimeter based on the given ratio of height to semi-perimeter?2. What calculation can be done to convert the paper width from centimeters to meters?3. How many meters of paper 50 cm wide are needed to cover the walls of the room, considering the cost of Rs.2 per meter?4. How many square meters of the room's walls need to be excluded for the area of doors and windows?5. Using the cost of Rs.260 and the cost per meter, how much does it cost to paper the walls without considering the exclusion of doors and windows?6. Given the total cost and the cost per meter, what is the total length of the walls that need to be papered, including the area for doors and windows?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the semi-perimeter of the room based on the given height-to-semi-perimeter ratio, you would first express the semi-perimeter (s) in terms of the height (h). Let's denote the ratio as r, so s = hr. If the ratio is provided, you can simply multiply the height by the ratio to find the semi-perimeter.To convert the paper width from centimeters to meters, you would divide the width in centimeters by 100, since there are 100 centimeters in a meter. So, if the paper is 50 cm wide, the width in meters would be 50 / 100 = 0.5 meters.To determine the amount of paper needed to cover the walls, you would multiply the total wall area by the paper's width. Assuming the room has four walls, each with the same height as the semi-perimeter (s), the total width for all walls is 4 * s. The cost calculation would be done by multiplying the total width in meters by the cost per meter, which is Rs.2. Let's assume the area of doors and windows is A square meters. To find out how many square meters need to be excluded, you would subtract A from the total wall area, which is 4 * sh.The cost to paper the walls without considering doors and windows can be found by multiplying the total width (4 * sh) in meters by the cost per meter (Rs.2). If the total cost is Rs.260, you can set up the equation: 4 * s * h * 2 = 260.Finally, to find the total length of the walls that need to be papered, including the area for doors and windows, you would add the area of the doors and windows (A) back to the total wall area after the exclusion. This can be expressed as 4 * s + A. Once you have the total length, you can find the cost by multiplying it by the cost per meter again.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Using the principle of similar triangles, we know that the ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow remains constant under the same lighting conditions. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

Height of flagstaff / Length of flagstaff's shadow = Height of building / Length of building's shadow

Given:
Height of flagstaff = 17.5 m
Length of flagstaff's shadow = 40.25 m
Length of building's shadow = 28.75 m

Now, let's plug in the values and solve for the height of the building:

(17.5 m) / (40.25 m) = Height of building / (28.75 m)

Multiplying both sides by 28.75 m:

Height of building = (17.5 m) × (28.75 m) / (40.25 m)

Calculating the product and division:

Height of building ≈ 12.5 m

So, the height of the building that casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions will be approximately 12.5 meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.5 metre.

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular sheet, folded into two equal halves, perimeter, 48 cm, one set of sides, 66 cm, other set of sides, area of the sheet.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of folding a rectangular sheet into two equal halves?2. How does folding along different sets of sides affect the perimeters of the resulting halves?3. Can we express the perimeters of the halves in terms of the dimensions of the original rectangle?4. How do we relate the perimeters obtained from folding along different sets of sides to find the dimensions of the original rectangle?5. Once we have the dimensions of the original rectangle, how do we calculate its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Folding a rectangular sheet into two equal halves means bisecting it along a line parallel to one of its shorter sides, resulting in two congruent rectangles. Folding along different sets of sides refers to choosing different pairs of opposite sides as the fold lines. When folded along one set of sides, the resulting halves share a common side (the longer side of the original rectangle), while the other two sides correspond to half the lengths of the shorter sides of the original rectangle. Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides, the resulting halves share a common side (one of the shorter sides of the original rectangle), while the other two sides correspond to half the length of the longer side of the original rectangle.

The perimeters of the halves can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the original rectangle as follows:
- When folded along one set of sides (call it "fold A"), the perimeter of each half is given by P_A = L/2 + W + L/2 = L + W, where L is the length and W is the width of the original rectangle.
- When folded along the other set of sides (call it "fold B"), the perimeter of each half is given by P_B = W/2 + L + W/2 = L + W, where again L is the length and W is the width of the original rectangle.

Given that P_A = 48 cm and P_B = 66 cm, we can equate these expressions to obtain two equations:
- L + W = 48 cm (from fold A)
- L + W = 66 cm (from fold B)

Since the sum of the length and width should be the same regardless of the folding direction, there seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement. It appears that either the perimeters provided for the two folds are incorrect or there is some misunderstanding in the description of the folding process. As such, it is currently impossible to determine the dimensions of the original rectangle and hence its area based on the given information.

Therefore, among A through E, there is no valid answer.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
R, S, T, U - points on a line
U is the midpoint of line segment ST
Lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are given as 5, 17, and 22, respectively
Objective: Find the length of line segment RU

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the definition of a midpoint in relation to line segments?
2. Given that U is the midpoint of ST, how can we express the lengths of SU and UT in terms of the length of ST?
3. How can we relate the positions of points R, S, T, and U on the line based on the given lengths?
4. Using the relationships established, how can we determine the length of RU?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
From the information given, we know that U is the midpoint of line segment ST. This means that the distance from S to U (SU) and the distance from U to T (UT) are equal halves of the total length of ST.

1. Midpoint definition: For any line segment AB, if point C is the midpoint, then AC = CB = 1/2(AB).
2. Applying this definition to ST and U being the midpoint, we have:
   SU = UT = 1/2(ST)
   Since ST = 22, we can calculate SU and UT:
   SU = UT = 1/2(22) = 11
3. Now we consider the positions of R, S, T, and U on the line. Given that RS = 5 and RT = 17, we can visualize the arrangement as follows:
   R ---- 5 ---- S ---- 11 ---- T
            |------------------|
                    22 (ST)

Since U is the midpoint of ST, it divides ST into two equal parts of length 11 each. From the diagram, we see that RU is the sum of RS and SU.

4. Determine the length of RU:
   RU = RS + SU
       = 5 + 11
       = 16

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 16 units.

 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..

When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut.

Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Rectangular piece of land
- Area: 150 sq m
- Length relation: 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth
- Objective: Find the perimeter

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How can we express the length in terms of the breadth based on the given relation?
2. Given the area and the expression for length in terms of breadth, how can we derive an equation to find the breadth?
3. Once we have the breadth, how do we calculate the length using the derived expression?
4. Having found both length and breadth, how do we compute the perimeter of the rectangle?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:

From the given relation, we can express the length (L) as:
L = 4B + 1

where B is the breadth of the rectangle.

The area (A) of the rectangle is given by:
A = L × B

Substituting the expression for L in terms of B:
150 = (4B + 1) × B

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
150 = 4B^2 + B

Rearranging to form a quadratic equation:
4B^2 + B - 150 = 0

Solving for B using the quadratic formula or factoring method:
(4B - 15)(B + 10) = 0

We discard the negative solution (-10) since the breadth cannot be negative. Thus, the breadth (B) is:
B = 150 / 4 = 37.5 m

Now, we can find the length (L) using the expression:
L = 4B + 1 = 4 × 37.5 + 1 = 151 m

Finally, the perimeter (P) of the rectangle is:
P = 2 × (Length + Breadth) = 2 × (151 + 37.5) = 376 m

Therefore, among the answer choices provided, there is no correct match for the calculated perimeter (376 m). It seems there may be an error in the answer choices provided or in the question itself. Please double-check the values and provide accurate options.

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
- Rectangular parking space
- Marked out by painting three sides
- Unpainted side length: 9 feet
- Sum of painted sides' lengths: 37 feet
- Area of the parking space
- Square feet

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the significance of painting three sides of the rectangular parking space?
2. How can we determine the length and width of the rectangular parking space based on the given information?
3. What formula should be used to calculate the area of a rectangle?
4. Can we deduce any additional constraints or relationships between the dimensions of the parking space from the fact that only three sides are painted?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The rectangular parking space is defined by marking out three of its sides with paint. This means that one side remains unpainted, which is explicitly stated to be 9 feet long. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is given as 37 feet. Since a rectangle has four sides, and we know the length of one side (unpainted) and the sum of the lengths of the other three sides (painted), we can deduce the individual lengths of the painted sides.

Let L be the length of the parking space (the longer side parallel to the unpainted side) and W be the width (the shorter side perpendicular to the unpainted side). We have:

Unpainted side (W): 9 feet
Sum of painted sides (2L + W): 37 feet

We can now solve for L:

2L + W = 37
2L = 37 - W
L = (37 - W) / 2

Since we want to find the area of the parking space, which is given by the formula:

Area = Length × Width
= L × W

Substituting the expression for L:

Area = [(37 - W) / 2] × W

To simplify this expression and find the area, we need to expand and combine like terms:

Area = (37W - W^2) / 2

Now, we have an expression for the area in terms of W. However, without more information about the specific dimensions of the painted sides, we cannot uniquely determine the values of L and W, and thus the area of the parking space. The given information allows us to express the area as a function of W, but it does not provide sufficient constraints to calculate a single numerical value for the area.

Therefore, among the answer choices provided, the correct response is (E) None, indicating that the area of the parking space cannot be determined with the given information.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones. If the manufacturer ships 4 crates, how many phones are shipped?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1000p (B) 1500p (C) 2000p (D) 2500p (E) 30000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:phone manufacturer, crates, pallets, each pallet, phones, 4 crates.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of phones per crate?2. How many phones does one pallet hold?3. What is the relationship between the number of pallets and the number of phones in a crate?4. How many phones are there in 4 crates if each crate has the same number of pallets?5. Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: tank, dimensions, capacity, 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m, liters.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How do you calculate the volume of a rectangular prism (tank)?
2. Given the dimensions of the tank (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m), what is its volume in cubic meters?
3. How do you convert cubic meters to liters?
4. Using the calculated volume in cubic meters, what is the equivalent volume in liters?

Step 3: Analyze these new questions to infer the solution:
To calculate the volume of a rectangular prism (the tank), we use the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]

In this case, the length is 8 meters, the width is 6 meters, and the height is 2.5 meters. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = 8 \text{ m} \times 6 \text{ m} \times 2.5 \text{ m} \]

Next, we compute the product:

\[ \text{Volume} = 120 \text{ m}^3 \]

Now, we need to convert cubic meters to liters. We know that 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters. So, to get the volume of the tank in liters, we multiply the volume in cubic meters by 1000:

\[ \text{Volume}_{\text{liters}} = \text{Volume}_{\text{m}^3} \times 1000 \]

Substituting the calculated volume in cubic meters:

\[ \text{Volume}_{\text{liters}} = 120 \text{ m}^3 \times 1000 \]

\[ \text{Volume}_{\text{liters}} = 120,000 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, among the given answer choices, the correct answer is:

(D) 120,000 liters

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3.

When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
 Answer Choices: (A)  13.3542 (B)  15.8113 (C)  18.3451 (D)  19.5667 (E)  20.8888
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, sphere, diameter..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation connects the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter?2. What is the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid?3. Who or what determines the sphere's diameter based on the inscribed rectangular solid?4. In which geometric context does this problem take place - Euclidean space or a non-Euclidean surface?5. When inscribing a rectangular solid into a sphere, what property ensures that all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface?6. How can we calculate the sphere's diameter using the dimensions of the rectangular solid (3 x 4 x 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The problem revolves around the relationship between a rectangular solid and a sphere inscribed within it in Euclidean space. The mathematical operation connecting the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter is the concept of similarity. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the longest diagonal of the solid represents the diameter of the sphere. This relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the three dimensions of the rectangular solid, which states that the square of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two dimensions (l, w, and h): d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2.In this case, let's use the dimensions provided: l = 3 units, w = 4 units, and h = 15 units. Calculating the longest diagonal (d) gives us:d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225d^2 = 250Now, taking the square root of both sides to find the diameter:d = √250 ≈ 15.81 unitsThus, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.81 units, and it is determined by the inscribed rectangular solid's dimensions within a Euclidean context. The property that ensures all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface is known as the 'inscribed property,' which guarantees that the sphere's radius is half the length of the longest diagonal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:
cube, sphere, fit inside, volume, ratio.

Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. What is the relationship between the cube and the sphere in terms of their sizes?
2. How do I find the volume of a cube given its side length?
3. How do I find the volume of a sphere given its diameter or radius?
4. What is the diameter or radius of the sphere that fits inside the cube?
5. How do I express the ratio of two volumes?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The question asks for the ratio of the volumes of a cube and a sphere that fits inside it. We know that the largest sphere that can fit inside a cube has a diameter equal to the side length of the cube. Let's denote the side length of the cube as "s".

Volume of a cube (V_cube) = s^3
Volume of a sphere (V_sphere) = (4/3)π(r^3), where r is the radius of the sphere.

Since the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, the radius (r) is half of the side length (s):

r = s / 2

Substitute this into the formula for the volume of the sphere:

V_sphere = (4/3)π((s/2)^3)
          = (4/3)π(s^3/8)
          = (1/6)πs^3

Now, we can find the ratio of the volumes:

Ratio = V_cube : V_sphere
      = s^3 : (1/6)πs^3
      = 1 : (1/6)π
      = 6 : π

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D (6: π).
