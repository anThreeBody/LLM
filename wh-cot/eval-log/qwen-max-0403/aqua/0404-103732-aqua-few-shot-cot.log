Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer:
Output:
The difference between the two numbers is divisible by N since they give the same remainder when divided by N:

(2272 - 875) = 1397

Now, we need to find the factors of 1397. Since we're looking for a three-digit number, we'll focus on factors close to the square root of 1397. The square root of 1397 is approximately 37, so we'll check factors around this value.

Factors of 1397:
1 × 1397 (not a three-digit number)
11 × 127 (three-digit numbers)

Since 11 + 12 = 23, which is less than 1397, we can conclude that 11 and 127 are the only pair of factors that add up to a three-digit number. Therefore, the number N that gives the same remainder when dividing 2272 and 875 is 127.

Sum of the digits of N:
1 + 2 + 7 = 10

Question:What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
Answer:
Output:
To find the greatest number of identical bouquets, we need to determine the maximum number of bouquets that can be formed using both the white and red tulips without any flowers being left out.

First, let's consider the white tulips:
We have 28 white tulips. To make identical bouquets, we must divide the total number of white tulips evenly among the bouquets. The largest factor of 28 that divides it completely is 28 itself. Therefore, we can make 1 bouquet with all 28 white tulips or 2 bouquets with 14 white tulips each, and so on, up to a maximum of 28 bouquets with 1 white tulip each. However, since we also have red tulips to consider, the actual number of bouquets will be limited by how many red tulips we can distribute equally among them.

Now, let's consider the red tulips:
We have 98 red tulips. Similar to the white tulips, we must divide the total number of red tulips evenly among the bouquets. The largest factor of 98 that divides it completely is 98 itself. Therefore, we can make 1 bouquet with all 98 red tulips or 2 bouquets with 49 red tulips each, and so on, up to a maximum of 98 bouquets with 1 red tulip each.

To maximize the number of identical bouquets, we should look for the highest common factor (HCF) of both the number of white and red tulips, as this will ensure that we can create equal numbers of bouquets using both types of flowers without any leftovers.

HCF(28, 98) = HCF(2^2 × 7, 2 × 7^2) = 2 × 7 = 14

The HCF of 28 (white tulips) and 98 (red tulips) is 14. This means we can make identical bouquets containing 14 white tulips and 14 red tulips each without any flowers being left out.

Since we have enough white tulips (28) to make 2 bouquets of 14 tulips each, and enough red tulips (98) to make 7 bouquets of 14 tulips each, the greatest number of identical bouquets we can make is the smaller of these two quantities, which is 2.

However, this result seems incorrect based on the available options. Let's reevaluate the factors of 28 and 98:

Factors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
Factors of 98: 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98

The common factors are 1, 2, 7, and 14. Since we want to maximize the number of bouquets, we should choose the highest common factor, which is 14. This indicates that we can make identical bouquets containing 14 white tulips and 14 red tulips each without any flowers being left out.

Given that we have 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, we can make:

White tulips: 28 / 14 = 2 bouquets
Red tulips: 98 / 14 = 7 bouquets

The limiting factor here is the number of white tulips, as we can only make 2 bouquets with them. Therefore, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is 2.

It appears there might be an error in the provided answer choices, as they do not include the correct answer (2). Please double-check the question and answer choices, and provide the accurate set of options if needed.

Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the number as N.

According to the problem, one-third of three-quarters of the number is equal to 21:

(1/3) × (3/4) × N = 21

First, let's simplify the fraction:

(1/4) × N = 21

Now, to find the value of N, we can multiply both sides by 4:

N = 21 × 4

Calculating the product:

N = 84

The number is 84.

Question:At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
Answer:
Output:
First, consider arranging all 10 speakers without any restrictions. There are 10! (10 factorial) ways to do this.

Now, we need to account for the protocol that requires the PM to speak before the MP, and the MP to speak before the MLA. These three positions must be fixed within the arrangement:

1. PM
2. MP
3. MLA

There are 7 remaining positions for the other 7 speakers, which can be arranged in 7! ways.

So, the total number of ways the meeting can be held with the given protocol is:

10! / (3! × 7!) = 10! / (6 × 7!)

Comparing this expression with the answer choices, we see that it matches choice D:

10! / 4

Therefore, the answer is D.

Question:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
Answer:
Output:
M - N = (abc - cba) = 100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c)
Given M - N + 396c = 990
=> 99(a - c) + 396c = 990
=> a - c + 4c = 10
=> a + 3c = 10
Since M > 300, a >= 3
Also since a and c are single digits, a can take values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 giving corresponding values for c as 1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3 respectively.
Of these only (a,c) pairs (3,1), (4,2), (5,1) satisfy the condition c > 0. Thus there are 3 values of M that are more than 300.
The answer is A.

Question:The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
Answer:
Output:
Let the three-digit number be represented as ABC, where A, B, and C are its digits.

Given:
1. A + B + C = 17 (sum of the digits)
2. A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 (sum of the squares of the digits)
3. ABC - 495 = CBA (when subtracted by 495, the number reverses)

From condition 1, we can deduce that A, B, and C must be close to 17 / 3 ≈ 5.67. Since they are integers, consider the following possibilities:

Case 1: One digit is 6, and the other two are 5. In this case, the sum of their squares would be (6^2) + (5^2) + (5^2) = 36 + 25 + 25 = 86, which does not match condition 2.

Case 2: One digit is 7, and the other two are 5. In this case, the sum of their squares would be (7^2) + (5^2) + (5^2) = 49 + 25 + 25 = 109, which matches condition 2.

Now, let's check condition 3 for Case 2:

ABC - 495 = CBA

If A = 7, B = 5, and C = 5, then:

755 - 495 = 260 ≠ 557 (reverse of 755)

If A = 5, B = 7, and C = 5, then:

575 - 495 = 80 ≠ 557 (reverse of 575)

If A = 5, B = 5, and C = 7, then:

557 - 495 = 62 ≠ 755 (reverse of 557)

None of these combinations satisfy condition 3 when reversed after subtracting 495. However, since the sum of the squares matches condition 2 only for Case 2, we need to reexamine our approach. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the provided answer choices, as none of them correspond to a valid solution based on the given conditions.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to determine the correct three-digit number satisfying all the given conditions. Please verify the problem statement or provide the correct answer choices.

Question:A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
Answer:
Output:
Sum of n terms of an AP = (n/2) x [2a + (n - 1)d], where 'a' is the first term, 'd' is the common difference, and 'n' is the number of terms.
Given:
First term (a) = 7 years
Common difference (d) = 3 months = 0.25 years (since 1 year = 12 months)
Sum of ages = 250 years

We need to find the number of members (n):

250 = (n/2) x [2(7) + (n - 1)(0.25)]

Simplifying:

250 = (n/2) x [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]
250 = (n/2) x [13.75 + 0.25n]

Multiplying both sides by 2:

500 = n x [13.75 + 0.25n]
500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2

This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 0.25, b = 13.75, and c = -500.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

x = [-13.75 ± sqrt((13.75)^2 - 4(0.25)(-500))] / (2 × 0.25)

x = [-13.75 ± sqrt(188.4375 + 500)] / 0.5

x = [-13.75 ± sqrt(688.4375)] / 0.5

x ≈ [-13.75 ± 26.23] / 0.5

x ≈ (-13.75 + 26.23) / 0.5 ≈ 22.48 / 0.5 ≈ 44.96 (not an integer; discard)
x ≈ (-13.75 - 26.23) / 0.5 ≈ -40 ≈ -40 (integer; consider)

Since the club must have a positive number of members, the only valid solution is x = -40, which does not make sense in this context. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or calculations. Please double-check the values provided and ensure they are correct. If you can provide accurate information, I'll be happy to help you solve the problem.

Question:The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
Answer:
Output:
To find the other integer, you can use the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers:

LCM × GCF = First Integer × Second Integer

Given:
GCF = 11
LCM = 7700
First Integer = 350

We need to find the Second Integer. Plugging in the values:

7700 × 11 = 350 × Second Integer

Now, calculate:

Second Integer = (7700 × 11) / 350
Second Integer = 7700 ÷ 350 × 11
Second Integer = 22 × 11
Second Integer = 242

The other integer is 242.

Question:What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12
Answer:
Output:
For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant b^2 - 4ac must be greater than zero.

In the given equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0:

a = 1
b = -5
c = k

The discriminant D is:

D = b^2 - 4ac
D = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k)
D = 25 - 4k

For the equation to have two real and distinct roots, we need:

D > 0
25 - 4k > 0

Now, solve for k:

25 > 4k
k < 25 / 4
k < 6.25

Since k must be an integer, the largest integral value of k that satisfies this condition is:

k = 6

However, the provided answer choices do not include 6. It seems there might be an error in the question or the answer choices provided. Please verify the question and/or the answer choices.

Question:There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 105 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) 525
Answer:
Output:
To determine the number of ways to divide the ten lime soda bottles into two groups of five members each, you can use the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)

where:
n is the total number of items (in this case, 10 lime soda bottles)
k is the number of items in each group (in this case, 5 bottles)
! denotes factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)

In this scenario, we want to find the number of combinations of 10 items taken 5 at a time:

C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10 - 5)!)
          = 10! / (5! × 5!)
          = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))

Calculating the factorials:

C(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
          = 30240 / 120
          = 252

So, there are 252 ways to create two groups of five members each from the ten lime soda bottles on the table.

Question:Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
Answer:
Output:
First, let's determine how many small cakes and large cakes each helper can produce in the given time:

Helpers can work for 3 hours.

Each helper can make:
- 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours they can make 2 × 3 = 6 large cakes.
- 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours they can make 35 × 3 = 105 small cakes.

Now, we need to find out how many helpers are required to make:
- 20 large cakes
- 700 small cakes

For large cakes:
Number of helpers needed for large cakes = Total large cakes needed / Large cakes per helper
= 20 large cakes / 6 large cakes per helper
≈ 3.33 helpers (rounded up because you cannot have a fraction of a helper)

For small cakes:
Number of helpers needed for small cakes = Total small cakes needed / Small cakes per helper
= 700 small cakes / 105 small cakes per helper
≈ 6.67 helpers (rounded up)

Since we need both large and small cakes, we must consider the larger number of helpers required for either task. In this case, it is the number of helpers needed for small cakes (approximately 7).

However, since some of these helpers will also be making large cakes, we need to ensure that there are enough helpers to produce the required number of large cakes within the group of 7 helpers. Since each helper can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours, a group of 7 helpers can make:

7 helpers × 6 large cakes per helper = 42 large cakes

This is more than enough to meet the requirement of 20 large cakes. Therefore, we do not need any additional helpers specifically for making large cakes.

So, the total number of helpers required is 7.

Question:Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 33 (C) 35 (D) 42 (E) 58
Answer:
Output:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x.

After subtracting 9 from each number, they become:

3x - 9 and 5x - 9

According to the problem, these new numbers are in the ratio 12:23:

(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23

Cross-multiply:

23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)

Expanding both sides:

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

Subtract 60x from both sides:

9x - 207 = -108

Add 207 to both sides:

9x = 99

Divide by 9:

x = 11

Now, find the smaller number:

Smaller number = 3x = 3 × 11 = 33

The smaller number is 33.

Question:I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Answer:
Output:
The number must end with 5, because when you append a 1, it becomes three times larger (the last two digits become 65). Let's denote the four-digit number preceding the 5 as XYZW:

XYZW5 × 3 = XYZW1

To maintain equality, the rightmost digits must match, meaning W × 3 + 5 = 15. Thus, W = 10 / 3, which is not an integer and contradicts our assumption that XYZW5 is a five-digit number. Therefore, no such number exists with the described property.

Answer: No such 5-digit number exists.

Question:A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
Answer:
Output:
Let the two-digit number be represented as $10x + y$, where $x$ is the digit in the tens place and $y$ is the digit in the units place. According to the given conditions:

1. The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:
\[10x + y = x + y + 18\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[9x = 18\]
\[x = \frac{18}{9} = 2\]

So, the digit in the tens place is 2.

2. The digit in the units place is double the digit in the tens place:
\[y = 2 \times x = 2 \times 2 = 4\]

Now that we have both digits, the two-digit number is $24$.

The correct answer is (B) 24.

Question:64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
Answer:
Output:
Let x be the number of boys and girls who joined the group. After the membership drive, there are:
Boys: 64 + x
Girls: 40 + x

The ratio of boys to girls is given as 4:3, so we can set up the following equation:

(64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)

Expanding:

192 + 3x = 160 + 4x

Subtracting 3x from both sides:

192 = 160 + x

Adding 160 to both sides:

x = 32

Now that we know 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group, we can calculate the total number of members:

Total members = (Original boys + New boys) + (Original girls + New girls)
= (64 + 32) + (40 + 32)
= 96 + 72
= 168

Question:If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
Answer:
Output:
Total number of eligible voters: 5,000 - (20% of 5,000) = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

Winning candidate's margin: 15% of 4,000 = (15/100) × 4,000 = 600 votes

To find the total number of votes the winning candidate received, we need to add their margin to half of the total eligible votes, since they won by 15% (which means they received 50% + 15% = 65% of the votes).

Total votes for winning candidate:
Half of eligible votes + Winning candidate's margin
= (1/2) × 4,000 + 600
= 2,000 + 600
= 2,600 votes

Question:What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
Answer:
Output:
The product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as:
n × (n + 1) × (n + 2)

Given that the product is equal to 727 + 728 + 729:

n × (n + 1) × (n + 2) = 727 + 728 + 729

First, calculate the sum on the right-hand side:
727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

Now set up the equation with the calculated sum:
n × (n + 1) × (n + 2) = 2184

To find the value of n, we need to factorize 2184. Since it's a large number, let's start by checking if it's divisible by any small primes. We notice that 2184 is divisible by 2:

2184 ÷ 2 = 1092

Next, we see that 1092 is also divisible by 2:

1092 ÷ 2 = 546

Continuing, 546 is divisible by 3:

546 ÷ 3 = 182

And finally, 182 is divisible by 2 again:

182 ÷ 2 = 91

At this point, we have factored 2184 into prime factors:
2184 = 2^3 × 3 × 7 × 13

Now we need to reassemble these prime factors into three consecutive integers. Notice that the prime factors include 2^3, 3, 7, and 13, which suggests the following arrangement:
(n, n + 1, n + 2) = (2^2 × 3 × 7, 2 × 13, 13)

This gives us:
n = 2^2 × 3 × 7 = 84
n + 1 = 2 × 13 = 26
n + 2 = 13

However, these numbers are not consecutive. Let's try another arrangement:
(n, n + 1, n + 2) = (2^2 × 3, 2 × 7 × 13, 2 × 7 × 13 + 1)

This gives us:
n = 2^2 × 3 = 12
n + 1 = 2 × 7 × 13 = 182
n + 2 = 2 × 7 × 13 + 1 = 183

These numbers are still not consecutive. It seems that there might be an error in the problem statement or the provided choices, as it appears impossible to express the sum 727 + 728 + 729 as the product of three consecutive integers.

Since we cannot find a valid solution based on the given information, there is no correct answer among the provided choices. Please double-check the problem statement or consult the source for clarification.

Question:In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
Answer:
Output:
The smallest 4-digit number divisible by all three fractions (1/16, 1/10, and 1/8) is their least common multiple (LCM). To find the LCM, we need to convert the fractions to their lowest terms:

1/16 (already in lowest terms)
1/10 = 2/20 = 1/20 (dividing numerator and denominator by 2)
1/8 = 2/16 = 1/16 (dividing numerator and denominator by 2)

Now, we have:
1/16, 1/20, and 1/16

Since two of the fractions are equal (1/16), their LCM is simply their shared value: 16. Now, we need to find the LCM of 16 and 20:

LCM(16, 20) = 2^4 × 5 = 80

So, the LCM of all three fractions is 80. The smallest 4-digit number divisible by 80 is 80 × 12 = 960.

For the maximum number of students, we want to find the largest 4-digit number divisible by 80. Since 1000 is not divisible by 80, the next largest 4-digit number that is divisible by 80 is 960 + 80 = 1040.

Difference between maximum and minimum number of students:
Max - Min = 1040 - 960 = 80

However, the provided answer choices do not match this result. It seems there might be an error in the question or the answer choices provided. Please verify the question and/or answer choices.

Question:Five dozen toys are packed in a box and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round ? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) 8
Answer:
Output:
Number of toys per box = 5 dozen = 5 × 12 = 60 toys
Total number of toys in 98 boxes = 98 × 60 = 5880 toys

To find the number of tempos needed to lift 29400 toys:

Number of tempos = Total number of toys / Number of toys per tempo

First, calculate the total number of toys that can be lifted by one tempo:
One tempo carries 98 boxes, with each box containing 60 toys:
Total toys per tempo = 98 boxes × 60 toys per box = 5880 toys

Now, divide the total number of toys (29400) by the total toys per tempo (5880):
Number of tempos = 29400 toys / 5880 toys per tempo = 5 tempos

The correct answer is B: 5 tempos.

Question:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
Answer:
Output:
To find the probability that a number chosen from Set S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to determine how many numbers in Set S are relatively prime to 1,000 and then divide that count by the total number of elements in Set S.

First, let's factorize 1,000:
1,000 = 2^3 × 5^3

Since two numbers are relatively prime if they have no common positive factors other than 1, a number from Set S will be relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not contain any factors of 2 or 5.

Set S contains all integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive, which means there are 1,000 elements in Set S.

Now, we'll calculate the number of integers in Set S that do have factors of 2 or 5:

For 2: There are 1,000 / 2 = 500 even numbers in Set S. These are not relatively prime to 1,000.

For 5: We need to consider multiples of 5 but exclude those already counted as even numbers (i.e., multiples of both 2 and 5). There are 1,000 / 5 = 200 multiples of 5 in Set S. However, among these, half (100) are also even numbers, which we've already counted. Thus, there are an additional 100 odd multiples of 5 that are not relatively prime to 1,000.

Total count of numbers in Set S that are not relatively prime to 1,000:
Even numbers (multiples of 2): 500
Odd multiples of 5: 100

Total non-relatively prime numbers: 500 + 100 = 600

Now, we can find the count of numbers in Set S that are relatively prime to 1,000:

Total elements in Set S: 1,000
Non-relatively prime numbers: 600

Relatively prime numbers: 1,000 - 600 = 400

Finally, we calculate the probability:

Probability = (Number of relatively prime numbers) / (Total number of elements in Set S)
Probability = 400 / 1,000

Simplify the fraction:

Probability = 4 / 10
Probability = 2 / 5

The probability that a number chosen from Set S is relatively prime to 1,000 is (D) 2/5.

Question:The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the smallest of these five consecutive odd numbers as x. Then, the next four odd numbers would be x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8. The sum of these five numbers is:

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20

According to the problem, when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore:

(5x + 20) / 10 = (1/2)(5x + 20) = (5/2)x + 10 must be a perfect square.

We need to find an odd number x among the given choices such that (5/2)x + 10 is a perfect square. Let's check each option:

(A) 47: (5/2)(47) + 10 = 117.5, which is not an integer, let alone a perfect square.
(B) 91: (5/2)(91) + 10 = 237.5, which is not an integer, let alone a perfect square.
(C) 41: (5/2)(41) + 10 = 112.5, which is not an integer, let alone a perfect square.
(D) 67: (5/2)(67) + 10 = 172.5, which is not an integer, let alone a perfect square.
(E) 44: This choice is even, so it cannot be one of the consecutive odd numbers.

None of the given options satisfy the condition that the sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square.

2/3 * x - 1/3 * x = 40 + 10
(2/3 - 1/3) * x = 50
1/3 * x = 50

Finally, we find the value of x by multiplying both sides by 3:

x = 50 * 3
x = 150

The correct answer is:
(C) 150

Question:John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
Answer:
Output:
First choose a vowel for the middle position: 5 ways.
Then choose two distinct consonants for the first and third positions: (20 choose 2) ways.
Finally, arrange these chosen letters: 2 ways (since the first and third positions are distinct).

Total number of codes:

\[ \text{Number of codes} = (5 \text{ ways}) \times (\text{20 choose 2 ways}) \times (2 \text{ ways}) \]

Calculate the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \text{20 choose 2} = \frac{20!}{2!(20 - 2)!} = \frac{20 \times 19 \times 18!}{2 \times 1 \times 18!} = \frac{20 \times 19}{2 \times 1} = 10 \times 19 = 190 \]

Now plug this value into the total number of codes formula:

\[ \text{Number of codes} = (5 \text{ ways}) \times (190 \text{ ways}) \times (2 \text{ ways}) = 5 \times 190 \times 2 = 1900 \]

The correct answer is (E) 1,900.

Answer:
Output:
The units digit of 9 raised to any positive integer power cycles through the pattern 9 → 1. Thus, the units digit of 9^3 is 1.

The units digit of 7 is 7.

Therefore, the units digit of 9^3 - 7 is:

1 - 7 = -6

Question:During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost? Answer Choices: (A) 70 (B) 30 (C) 3 (D) 7 (E) 5
Answer:
Output:
Number of matches lost = Total matches × Loss percentage

Given:
Total matches = 20 wins + losses
Loss percentage = 30%

We need to find the total number of matches played, which includes both wins and losses. Since the team won 20 matches, the remaining matches must be losses. We can express this as:

Total matches = Wins + Losses
Total matches = 20 + Losses

The loss percentage is given as 30%, or 0.30 in decimal form. To find the number of losses, we multiply the total number of matches by the loss percentage:

Number of losses = Total matches × 0.30

Substituting the expression for total matches from above:

Number of losses = (20 + Losses) × 0.30

Solving for the number of losses:

Number of losses = 20 × 0.30 + Losses × 0.30
Number of losses = 6 + 0.30Losses

Now, we have:

Number of losses = 6 + 0.30Losses

This equation represents the relationship between the number of losses and itself. To solve for the actual number of losses, we can rearrange the terms:

Number of losses - 0.30Losses = 6

Factoring out "Losses" on the left side:

Losses(1 - 0.30) = 6

Multiplying through by the reciprocal of the coefficient of Losses:

Losses = 6 / (1 - 0.30)

Calculating the value:

Losses = 6 / 0.70
Losses ≈ 8.57

Since the number of losses must be a whole number (you cannot have a fraction of a match), we round up to the nearest whole number because the team cannot lose less than a whole match. Therefore, the team lost approximately 9 matches during the season.

The correct answer is (C) 9.

Answer:
Output:
+45 and -30

Addition of integers with opposite signs involves subtracting their absolute values and keeping the sign of the number with the larger absolute value:

(+45) + (-30) = |+45| - |-30| = 45 - 30 = 15

Since the positive integer (+45) has the larger absolute value, the resulting sum retains its positive sign.

Question:Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
Answer:
Output:
To find the maximum number of students who did not attend either event, we need to minimize the number of students who attended either the prom or the debating session (or both). Since at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% took part in the debating session, the minimum combined percentage for these two groups is 45% + 35% = 80%.

Let's calculate the maximum number of students who did not attend either event:

Total students = 200

Minimum percentage attending either prom or debate = 80%

Maximum percentage not attending either event = 100% - 80% = 20%

Now, find the actual number of students who did not attend either event:

Number of students not attending either event = Total students × Maximum percentage not attending

Number of students not attending either event = 200 × 20%

Number of students not attending either event = 200 × 0.2

Number of students not attending either event = 40

However, since we're looking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, and we know that some students might have attended both events (which would reduce the count of those attending only one), the actual number will be less than 40. Therefore, among the provided answer choices, the closest value is 39, but it is not listed. The next closest option is 38, which still falls within the range of potential overlap between the two events. Thus, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 38.

Answer: None of the above.

Question:For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
Answer:
Output:
To find the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought, we need to maximize the number of brass coins since they yield a higher payment per coin. Let's assume she brought all brass coins:

Payment per brass coin: $0.25
Total payment received: $3.40

Number of brass coins:
$3.40 ÷ $0.25 = 13.6

Since the number of coins must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:

Minimum number of brass coins: 13

Now, let's calculate the total payment for these 13 brass coins:

Payment for 13 brass coins: 13 × $0.25 = $3.25

This amount is less than the total payment received ($3.40). To make up the difference, the diver must have brought at least one copper coin:

Remaining payment needed: $3.40 - $3.25 = $0.15

Payment per copper coin: $0.20

Number of copper coins needed to make up the difference:
$0.15 ÷ $0.20 = 0.75

Again, since the number of coins must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number:

Minimum number of copper coins: 1

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought is 1.

Question:A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above
Answer:
Output:
Ratio of rice:wheat:corn = 2:3:5

Given 3 pounds of rice corresponds to the "2" part of the ratio, we can set up a proportion:

(3 pounds rice)/(2 parts) = (x pounds corn)/(5 parts)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3 pounds rice × 5 parts = 2 parts × x pounds corn
15 pounds rice = 2x pounds corn

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 15 pounds rice / 2 = 7.5 pounds corn

Therefore, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn.

Answer:
Output:
The frog makes a net gain of 1 meter per day (3 meters up - 2 meters down). To reach the top of the 30-meter well, the frog needs:

Net Gain Needed: 30 meters

Net Gain Per Day: 1 meter

Days to Reach Top: Net Gain Needed / Net Gain Per Day = 30 meters / 1 meter/day = 30 days

However, on the last day when the frog reaches or exceeds the well's height, it won't fall back down. Therefore, the frog will emerge from the well after completing 29 days of its daily jump routine plus the final upward jump on the 30th day.

Total Days: 29 days + 1 day = 30 days

Question:Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the distance between X and Y as d kilometers.

When Allen and Bob meet for the first time at either X or Y, both have traveled the same distance (d kilometers). After this meeting, they change directions and continue traveling until they meet for the second time.

At their second meeting, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. Since Bob's speed is 78 kmph and Allen's speed is 54 kmph, the difference in distance covered by them in the same amount of time is:

(78 kmph - 54 kmph) × Time = 48 km

Solving for Time:

Time = 48 km / (78 kmph - 54 kmph) = 48 km / 24 kmph = 2 hours

During these 2 hours, Bob covers a total distance equal to his speed multiplied by the time:

Bob's Distance = 78 kmph × 2 hours = 156 km

Since Bob met Allen twice during this journey, he must have traveled the entire round trip between X and Y twice. Therefore, the distance between X and Y (d) can be found by dividing Bob's total distance by 2:

d = Bob's Distance / 2 = 156 km / 2 = 78 km

The distance between X and Y is 78 km.

Correct answer: (B) 72 km

Question:A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx)
Answer:
Output:
Rate = w/25 gallons per x seconds

To find the time for y gallons to pass through:

Time (in seconds) = Total volume / Rate
Time (in seconds) = y gallons / (w/25 gallons per x seconds)

Converting time to minutes:

Time (in minutes) = Time (in seconds) / 60

Combining both expressions:

Time (in minutes) = [y gallons / (w/25 gallons per x seconds)] / 60
Time (in minutes) = (y × 25 × 60) / (w × x)

Simplifying:

Time (in minutes) = 5xy / (12w)

Question:A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
Answer:
Output:
Relative speed between the two journeys = (distance / time for forward journey) - (distance / time for return journey)
= (d/6) - (d/4) = d(2/12 - 3/12) = -d/12

Since the relative speed is negative, it means the jeep traveled slower in the forward journey compared to the return journey. Given that the speed was increased by 12 km/hr during the return journey, we can equate this to the calculated relative speed:

12 km/hr = -d/12

Multiplying both sides by -12 gives:

d = -144 km

This result indicates that the jeep traveled a shorter distance in the forward journey compared to the return journey, which is not possible since they cover the same route. There seems to be an error in the problem statement or calculations. Please provide the correct details or rephrase the question.

Answer:C The answer is C.

Question:Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the distance between A and B as d miles.

According to the problem:

1. Kevin traveled from A to B at a speed of 70 mph.
2. He then immediately turned around and traveled back to A at a speed of 90 mph.
3. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his entire trip, he was 70 miles away from B, still approaching it.

We need to find the value of d.

Since Kevin was 70 miles away from B and traveling at 90 mph, it would take him:

Time to reach B = Distance / Speed = 70 miles / 90 mph = 7/9 hours

Now consider the entire round trip, which consists of two parts:

Part 1: Traveling from A to B at 70 mph.
Part 2: Traveling from B back to A at 90 mph.

At the moment when Kevin was 70 miles away from B and had 3 hours left in his trip, he had already completed Part 1 and was in the middle of Part 2. We know that Part 2 takes 7/9 hours to complete from that point.

Therefore, the total remaining time for the rest of the trip (including the last 7/9 hours to reach A and the additional 3 hours):

Total remaining time = 7/9 hours + 3 hours = (7/9 + 27/9) hours = 34/9 hours

The duration of Part 1 (traveling from A to B) must have been equal to the total remaining time minus the known duration of Part 2 (from 70 miles away from B to A):

Duration of Part 1 = Total remaining time - Duration of Part 2 = 34/9 hours - 7/9 hours = (34 - 7)/9 hours = 27/9 hours = 3 hours

So, Kevin spent 3 hours traveling from A to B at a speed of 70 mph. To find the distance between A and B (d), we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time
d = 70 mph × 3 hours = 210 miles

The distance between points A and B is 210 miles. However, this option is not listed among the choices provided. There seems to be an error or inconsistency in the question or the answer choices. Please verify the information and provide accurate options.

Question:An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
Answer:
Output:
Average speed = total distance / total time

The plane covers equal distances along each side of the square. Let's denote the side length as d km.

Total distance = 4d km

For the first side (speed 200 km/hr):
Time taken = d / 200 hr

For the second side (speed 400 km/hr):
Time taken = d / 400 hr

For the third side (speed 600 km/hr):
Time taken = d / 600 hr

For the fourth side (speed 800 km/hr):
Time taken = d / 800 hr

Total time = (d / 200) + (d / 400) + (d / 600) + (d / 800)

Now, calculate the average speed:

Average speed = (4d) / [(d / 200) + (d / 400) + (d / 600) + (d / 800)]

To simplify the expression, find a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator:

Common denominator = 200 \* 400 \* 600 \* 800 = 3,840,000

Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

Total time = (3,840,000d / 3,840,000) + (1,920,000d / 3,840,000) + (640,000d / 3,840,000) + (480,000d / 3,840,000)
= (3,840,000d + 1,920,000d + 640,000d + 480,000d) / 3,840,000
= (3,840,000 + 1,920,000 + 640,000 + 480,000)d / 3,840,000
= 7,880,000d / 3,840,000

Substitute the simplified total time into the average speed formula:

Average speed = (4d) / [(7,880,000d / 3,840,000)]
= (4d \* 3,840,000) / 7,880,000d
= (4 \* 3,840,000) / 7,880,000
= 15,360,000 / 7,880,000
≈ 1.947

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is approximately 1.947 times the speed of light. Since this value exceeds the speed of light (which is approximately 300,000 km/s or 186,282 mi/s), it is not physically possible for the plane to travel at this average speed. There must be an error in the problem statement or the provided answer choices. Please double-check the information and provide accurate data for a valid solution.

Question:Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that:

A + J = 35 (total number of toys made)

Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, and they have worked for almost similar numbers of hours, let's assume they both worked for T hours. Then:

T / 7 = A (hours Alex spent making A toys)
T / 9 = J (hours Jacob spent making J toys)

Given that T is approximately the same for both, we can equate the ratios of toys to hours:

A / T = 1 / 7
J / T = 1 / 9

Now, since A + J = 35, we can express A in terms of J:

A = 35 - J

Substituting this expression into the ratio equation for Alex:

(35 - J) / T = 1 / 7

Similarly, expressing J in terms of A:

J = 35 - A

Substituting this expression into the ratio equation for Jacob:

(35 - A) / T = 1 / 9

We now have two equations with two variables (A and T):

(35 - J) / T = 1 / 7
(35 - A) / T = 1 / 9

To find the value of J (the number of toys made by Jacob), we can solve these equations simultaneously. However, since we are looking for an approximate solution due to the "almost similar" working hours condition, we can use a simpler approach by considering the average time per toy:

Average time per toy = Total hours worked / Total toys made

Since Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours, their individual contributions to the total hours worked should be roughly equal. Let's calculate the average time per toy for each of them based on their individual rates:

Average time per toy for Alex = 7 hours / toy
Average time per toy for Jacob = 9 hours / toy

The difference between their average times per toy is:

Difference = Average time per toy for Jacob - Average time per toy for Alex
           = 9 hours / toy - 7 hours / toy
           = 2 hours / toy

Since they worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that the difference in the number of toys they made should be proportional to this difference in average time per toy. Given that the difference is 2 hours per toy, we can estimate that for every additional hour Jacob spends making a toy compared to Alex, he makes one fewer toy. Since Jacob takes 2 more hours per toy than Alex, he would make approximately 2 fewer toys.

If we start with the assumption that they each made half of the total toys (35/2 = 17.5), we can adjust Jacob's count downward by 2 toys to account for his slower production rate:

Estimated number of toys made by Jacob ≈ 17.5 - 2 = 15.5

However, since the number of toys must be an integer, we round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is 15 toys.

Question:A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the distance between the car and the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as x. Since the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° over 10 minutes, the car must have traveled some distance y during this time.

Using trigonometry, we can relate the angles and distances:

At 45°:
tan(45°) = h / x
1 = h / x

At 60°:
tan(60°) = h / (x + y)
√3 = h / (x + y)

Since tan(45°) = 1, we know that h = x. Now substitute h with x in the equation for 60°:

√3 = x / (x + y)

Rearrange the equation to solve for y:

y = x(√3 - 1)

The car's speed is constant, so we can determine the time it takes to travel distance y by dividing y by the car's speed. However, we don't have the car's speed. Instead, we need to express the time in terms of the known 10-minute interval during which the angle changed.

Let v be the car's speed (in appropriate units). Then, the distance y traveled in 10 minutes is:

y = v \* (10 minutes)

Now equate this expression for y with the previously derived expression for y in terms of x:

v \* (10 minutes) = x(√3 - 1)

We want to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which is when x = 0. However, since we cannot divide by zero, we cannot directly use this equation to find the additional time needed. Moreover, without knowing the car's speed or any other relevant information about the problem, it is impossible to determine the exact time required for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) None of these

Question:A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
Answer:
Output:
The point on the fan blade moves along a circular path with radius 10 cm. To find the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds, we need to calculate the circumference of the circle traced by the point and multiply it by the number of rotations made during this time.

Given:
Radius (r) = 10 cm
Fan speed = 300 revolutions per minute (rpm)

First, let's convert the time to minutes since the fan speed is given in rpm:

Time in minutes = 30 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 0.5 minutes

Now, calculate the number of rotations made in 0.5 minutes:

Number of rotations = Fan speed × Time in minutes
                   = 300 rpm × 0.5 minutes
                   = 150 rotations

Next, find the circumference of the circular path traced by the point:

Circumference (C) = 2πr
                  = 2 × π × 10 cm
                  = 20π cm

Finally, calculate the total distance traveled by the point:

Total distance = Circumference × Number of rotations
              = 20π cm × 150 rotations
              = 3000π cm

Question:The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the wage on the 8th day as W. We know that the total wages for the entire fortnight (15 days) were:

Total wages = Average wage × Number of days = $90 × 15

We also know that the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days were:

Wages for first 7 days = Average wage × Number of days = $87 × 7
Wages for last 7 days = Average wage × Number of days = $92 × 7

The sum of these two amounts should equal the total wages for the entire fortnight minus the wage on the 8th day:

(Wages for first 7 days + Wages for last 7 days) = Total wages - Wage on the 8th day

Now let's calculate the values:

$87 × 7 + $92 × 7 = ($90 × 15) - W

Solving for W:

$609 + $644 = $1350 - W
$1253 = $1350 - W
W = $1350 - $1253
W = $97

The wage on the 8th day was $97.

Question:Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
Answer:
Output:
To find the combined production rate of Machines A and B, we need to determine the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of their individual production rates:

Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes.
Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes.

LCM(6, 9) = 18 minutes

Together, Machines A and B produce 1 yo-yo every 18 minutes. Now, let's calculate how long it takes for them to produce 10 yo-yos:

Time to produce 10 yo-yos = (Number of yo-yos) × (Combined production rate)
Time to produce 10 yo-yos = 10 × 18 minutes

Let's compute the result:

Time to produce 10 yo-yos = 10 × 18 = 180 minutes

Question:In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
Answer:
Output:
The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM. To catch the first train that comes, he must arrive within the first 2 minutes for the harbor line train or within the first 10 minutes for the main line train.

Let T be the random arrival time of the man:
- For the harbor line train, the favorable outcome is T ≤ 2 minutes.
- For the main line train, the favorable outcome is T ≤ 10 minutes.

Since both trains run independently, we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them:

Probability of catching the harbor line train:
P(Harbor) = P(T ≤ 2 min) = 2 min / (2 + 10) min = 2/12 = 1/6

Probability of catching the main line train:
P(Main) = P(T ≤ 10 min) = 10 min / (2 + 10) min = 10/12 = 5/6

Since the man will catch the first train that comes (either harbor or main), these events are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the total probability of the man catching the first train is the sum of the individual probabilities:

P(Catching either Harbor or Main) = P(Harbor) + P(Main) = 1/6 + 5/6 = 1

Mr. Brown works for 8 days, completing 8/6 = 4/3 of a house. Mr. Black then works for 6 days, completing 6/8 = 3/4 of a house. Together, they finish 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 > 2 houses, leaving only 1 - 2 = -1 > 0 house remaining (this negative value indicates they've actually overcompleted the job). Since they've already painted more than the required 3 houses, Mr. Blue doesn't need to do any work. Thus, it will take Mr. Blue 0 days to complete the contract.

The answer is A.

Question:A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
Answer:
Output:
The area grazed by the cow forms a circle with radius equal to half the length of the rope (7 feet). The area of this circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr², where r is the radius:

A = π(7 ft)² ≈ 3.14 × 49 ft² = 153.86 ft²

Now, since the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, we can find the number of days needed to graze the entire circular area:

Total grazing time = Total area / Area grazed per day
                   = 153.86 ft² / 10 ft²/day
                   ≈ 15.386 days

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, because the cow cannot graze a fraction of a day, we get:

Approximate grazing time = 16 days

However, the provided answer choices do not include 16 days. It seems there might be an error or misinterpretation in the question or answer choices provided. Please verify the information and provide accurate options for me to give you the correct answer.

Question:A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
Answer:
Output:
Profit per bag = Selling Price - Cost Price = 25% of Selling Price

Let's denote the cost price of each bag as "x". Then:

Profit per bag = $100 - x = 0.25 × $100 = $25

Now we know that:

x = $100 - $25 = $75

The grocer makes a total profit of $3,000 by selling n bags:

Total Profit = Profit per bag × Number of bags sold
$3,000 = $25 × n

To find the number of bags sold (n), divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

n = $3,000 / $25 = 120 bags

However, there seems to be a mistake in the provided answer choices. None of them match the calculated value of 120 bags. Please provide the correct set of answer choices or confirm if the calculation is accurate.

Question:The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the original price as P. After a 30% reduction, the new price becomes:

New Price = P - (30% of P)
          = P - 0.3P
          = 0.7P

To restore the price back to its original value (i.e., 100% of P), we need to determine the percentage increase required on the new price (0.7P). Let's call this percentage increase I%.

After applying the percentage increase I%, the final price would be:

Final Price = New Price + (I% of New Price)
            = 0.7P + (I% × 0.7P)

We want the Final Price to equal the original price P:

0.7P + (I% × 0.7P) = P

Dividing both sides by 0.7P:

1 + (I/100) = 1 / 0.7

Solving for I:

I = 100 × ((1 / 0.7) - 1)
  ≈ 100 × (1.42857 - 1)
  ≈ 100 × 0.42857
  ≈ 42.857%

Question:Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that:

W + B = 18 (total number of sharpeners)

Jack pays Rs. 1 more for each white sharpener compared to a brown one. Let's assume the price of a brown sharpener is Rs. x. Then, the price of a white sharpener is Rs. (x + 1). The total cost for both types of sharpeners is Rs. 100:

W(x + 1) + Bx = 100

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1. W + B = 18
2. W(x + 1) + Bx = 100

We can solve these equations simultaneously or use logic to find the solution, considering that the prices should result in whole numbers and the quantities should add up to 18. Since the difference in price between white and brown sharpeners is only Rs. 1, it's likely that the majority of sharpeners are of the cheaper type (brown) to keep the overall cost low.

Option (A) suggests Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. If we assume the price of a brown sharpener is Rs. x, then the price of a white sharpener would be Rs. (x + 1). For 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners to cost Rs. 100 in total, we can set up the following equation:

10(x + 1) + 8x = 100

Solving for x:

10x + 10 + 8x = 100
18x = 90
x = 5

So, if a brown sharpener costs Rs. 5, a white sharpener costs Rs. 6 (Rs. 5 + 1). With these prices, the total cost for 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners is indeed Rs. 100:

10 white sharpeners × Rs. 6 = Rs. 60
8 brown sharpeners × Rs. 5 = Rs. 40
Total cost = Rs. 60 + Rs. 40 = Rs. 100

The solution matches our assumptions and calculations. Therefore, Jack bought:

White sharpeners: 10
Brown sharpeners: 8

Question:If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
Answer:
Output:
Total cost for 15 issues with discount = $42.00
This cost represents a 25% savings, meaning it is 75% of the original (cover price) cost.

Original (cover price) cost for 15 issues = Total cost / 0.75

Let's calculate:

Original cost for 15 issues = $42.00 / 0.75 = $56.00

Now, to find the cover price per issue, divide the total original cost by the number of issues:

Cover price per issue = Original cost for 15 issues / 15

Cover price per issue = $56.00 / 15 ≈ $3.73

The correct answer is (E) $3.73.

Question:A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 270 (B) 300 (C) 280 (D) 320 (E) 315
Answer:
Output:
Let's calculate the cost price (CP) using the given selling price (SP) and profit percentage:

Profit % = 20%
SP = Rs. 360

The formula to find CP when given SP and profit % is:

CP = (SP / (1 + Profit %))

Substituting the values:

CP = (360 / (1 + 0.20))
CP = (360 / 1.20)
CP = Rs. 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

Question:The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
Answer:
Output:
The manufacturer's discount is 20%. When a retailer adds an additional 20% discount, they effectively reduce the price by another 20% of the already discounted price. To find the combined or total discount, we need to calculate the overall reduction in price compared to the original price.

Let P represent the original price of the tubeless tires. After the manufacturer's 20% discount, the price becomes:

P × (1 - 20%) = P × 0.8

Now, when the retailer applies an additional 20% discount to this reduced price, the final price becomes:

(P × 0.8) × (1 - 20%) = P × 0.8 × 0.8 = P × 0.64

To determine the total discount, we compare the final price (P × 0.64) to the original price (P):

Total Discount = [(Original Price) - (Final Price)] / (Original Price)
              = [P - (P × 0.64)] / P
              = [P(1 - 0.64)] / P
              = (1 - 0.64)
              = 0.36

This represents a 36% total discount.

Question:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
To find the manufactured cost of each pen, we need to determine the total revenue and total cost for producing the pens, then calculate the cost per unit based on the promised profit margin.

Given:
Total number of pens delivered to the wholesaler = 7200
Selling price per pen = Rs. 10

Profit margin = 25%

Let's calculate the total revenue:

Total Revenue = Number of pens × Selling price per pen
Total Revenue = 7200 pens × Rs. 10/pen
Total Revenue = Rs. 72,000

Since the company has a 25% profit margin, this means that 75% of the Total Revenue represents the Total Cost:

Total Cost = Total Revenue × (1 - Profit Margin)
Total Cost = Rs. 72,000 × (1 - 0.25)
Total Cost = Rs. 72,000 × 0.75
Total Cost = Rs. 54,000

Now, we know that only 90% of the produced pens are non-defective and delivered to the wholesaler (since 10% are defective and rejected). Therefore, the actual number of pens produced must have been higher than 7200 to account for the rejects:

Number of pens produced = Number of pens delivered / (1 - Defect Rate)
Number of pens produced = 7200 pens / (1 - 0.10)
Number of pens produced = 7200 pens / 0.90
Number of pens produced ≈ 8,000 pens

Now, we can calculate the manufactured cost per pen by dividing the Total Cost by the actual number of pens produced:

Manufactured Cost per pen = Total Cost / Number of pens produced
Manufactured Cost per pen = Rs. 54,000 / 8,000 pens
Manufactured Cost per pen = Rs. 6.75

However, since the provided answer choices do not include Rs. 6.75, there seems to be an error or inconsistency in the problem statement or answer choices. Based on the given information, the closest option would be:

(A) Rs. 6

But please note that this value does not precisely match our calculated manufactured cost per pen (Rs. 6.75). If you could provide accurate answer choices or clarify any discrepancies in the problem statement, I would be happy to recalculate the answer accordingly.

Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the total weight of the original 10 oarsmen as W1 and the weight of the new man as Wnew.

The average weight of the original 10 oarsmen is increased by 1.8 kg when one person is replaced. This implies:

(W1 - 53 + Wnew) / 10 = Average weight increase + Original average weight

Given:
Average weight increase = 1.8 kg
Original average weight = W1 / 10

So,

(W1 - 53 + Wnew) / 10 = 1.8 + W1 / 10

Now, let's solve for Wnew:

W1 - 53 + Wnew = 1.8 × 10 + W1
Wnew = 1.8 × 10 + 53

Calculate the value:

Wnew = 18 + 53 = 71 kg

Question:If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Answer:
Output:
Q = (Employees taking only summer vacation)/(Total employees)
Let's calculate the number of employees who take only summer vacation:

1. Employees taking both vacations: 40% of total employees
2. Employees taking neither vacation: 20% of total employees

Therefore, employees taking either only winter or only summer vacation make up the remaining percentage:

100% - (40% + 20%) = 40%

Since 75% of employees take a winter vacation, those taking only a summer vacation must account for the difference within the 40%:

Summer-only vacationers = 40% - 75% = -35%

This result indicates an error in our calculations, as the percentage cannot be negative. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement or provided data, leading to contradictory information about the proportions of employees taking different types of vacations. As such, it is impossible to determine the correct percentage (Q) of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation based on the given information.

Please review the problem statement and provide accurate data for a valid solution.

Question:10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
Answer:
Output:
To determine how much of the mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand, we can set up an equation based on the desired final percentages of sand and clay. Let x be the amount of mixture (in kg) that needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand.

Initial mixture:
- Sand: 30% of 10 kg = 3 kg
- Clay: 70% of 10 kg = 7 kg

After removing x kg of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand, the new quantities will be:

New sand quantity = Initial sand quantity + (x kg of pure sand)
New clay quantity = Initial clay quantity - (x kg of mixture)

We want the new mixture to have equal quantities of sand and clay, meaning both should be (10 kg - x kg) / 2.

Equating the new sand and clay quantities:

Initial sand quantity + (x kg of pure sand) = (10 kg - x kg) / 2
3 kg + x kg = (10 kg - x kg) / 2

Now, solve for x:

6 kg + 2x kg = 10 kg - x kg
3x kg = 4 kg
x = 4 kg / 3 ≈ 1.33 kg

However, since we cannot remove a fraction of a kilogram, we need to round up to the nearest whole kilogram. In this case, we must remove at least 2 kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand to achieve equal quantities of sand and clay.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the provided choices. However, if we were to express the result as a fraction of the initial mixture weight (10 kg), it would be:

x = 2 kg / 10 kg = 2/10 = 1/5

So, the closest option to the actual result would be (A) 10/7, but it's important to note that this choice represents a different unit (a ratio rather than kilograms) and still does not precisely match the calculated value of 2 kg. To accurately represent the required removal and replacement amount, the answer should be stated as approximately 2 kg or 1/5 of the original mixture weight.

Question:An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
Answer:
Output:
The difference in total contributions between the original plan and the proposed scenario with an additional Rs. 60 per employee is:

Rs. 6.24 lakh - Rs. 6 lakh = Rs. 24,000

This difference represents the combined extra amount contributed by all employees. Since each employee contributes an extra Rs. 60, we can find the number of employees by dividing the total extra contribution by the individual extra contribution:

Number of employees = Total extra contribution / Individual extra contribution
                         = Rs. 24,000 / Rs. 60
                         = 400 employees

Therefore, there are 400 employees in the organization.

Question:The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the total weight of the initial 10 vehicles as W1. According to the problem:

Average weight of the initial 10 vehicles = 12.2 tons

So,
W1 = 10 × Average weight = 10 × 12.2 tons = 122 tons

After adding the heavy-duty truck, the total weight of the 11 vehicles becomes W2, and the average weight increases to 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.

New average weight = 14.8 tons

Total weight of the 11 vehicles (W2) = New average weight × Number of vehicles = 14.8 tons × 11 = 162.8 tons

Now, we can find the weight of the heavy-duty truck by subtracting the initial total weight from the new total weight:

Weight of the heavy-duty truck = W2 - W1 = 162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons

Question:M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? Answer Choices: (A) D/ (M-3)  (B) MD/3 (C) M/ (D-3)  (D) 3D/ (M2-3M)  (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
Total cost remains the same when some people drop out; hence each person has to contribute more. The contribution increases by (M - 3)/M times.
So new contribution = D/M × (M - 3)/M = D/(M(M - 3))
Therefore, increase = Old contribution - New contribution
= D/M - D/(M(M - 3)) = D{1/M - 1/(M(M - 3))}
= D{(M(M - 3) - M)/(M(M - 3)M)} = D(M^2 - 4M + 3 - M)/(M^2(M - 3))
= D(M^2 - 5M + 3)/(M^2(M - 3))
Therefore, answer is E.

Question:In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
Answer:
Output:
Number of tagged deer in the 500-deer sample = 20
Percentage of tagged deer in the sample = (Number of tagged deer / Total number of deer in the sample) × 100 = (20 / 500) × 100 = 4%

This percentage represents the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population. Since 300 deer were tagged in 2001, and assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002:

Total deer population = (Number of tagged deer in 2001 / Percentage of tagged deer in the population) = (300 / 4%) = 300 / 0.04 = 7500

Question:In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
Answer:
Output:
First, let's determine the proportion of vanilla-flavored chocolates:

Since 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, the remaining 90% must be vanilla flavored.

Now, let's find the proportion of vanilla-flavored chocolates that are not squashed:

We know that 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored (the "rest" mentioned in the problem). Out of these, 90% are squashed.

To find the percentage of vanilla-flavored chocolates that are not squashed, we subtract the percentage of squashed vanilla chocolates from 100%:

Percentage of not squashed vanilla = 100% - Percentage of squashed vanilla
Percentage of not squashed vanilla = 100% - (90% × 90%)

Calculating the expression inside the parentheses:

90% × 90% = 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.81 = 81%

Now, subtracting this from 100%:

Percentage of not squashed vanilla = 100% - 81% = 19%

However, we need to express this as a percentage of the total number of chocolates, not just the vanilla ones. Since 90% of the chocolates are vanilla, we multiply the result by 10%:

Percentage of not squashed vanilla among all chocolates = (Percentage of not squashed vanilla among vanilla) × (Percentage of vanilla among all chocolates)
Percentage of not squashed vanilla among all chocolates = 19% × 90%

Multiplying the percentages:

19% × 90% = 0.19 × 0.9 = 0.171 = 17.1%

Rounding to two decimal places, the final answer is approximately 17.1%, which corresponds to option (D).

Question:A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
Answer:
Output:
To maximize the number of trousers bought with the given budget, we need to minimize the cost of shirts. Since shirts are cheaper than trousers, we should buy the minimum number of shirts possible.

Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. We have:

Cost of trousers + Cost of shirts = Total budget

T × 70 + S × 30 = 810

70T + 30S = 810

Now, we want to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. To do this, we'll express T in terms of S and then find the smallest integer value for S that allows us to purchase whole numbers of both trousers and shirts within the budget.

Dividing by 10, we get:

7T + 3S = 81

Since T must be an integer, let's solve for T in terms of S:

T = (81 - 3S) / 7

For T to be an integer, (81 - 3S) must be divisible by 7. The smallest positive integer value for S that satisfies this condition is when S = 10, because:

81 - 3S = 81 - 3(10) = 51, which is divisible by 7.

Now, we can calculate T using this value of S:

T = (81 - 3(10)) / 7 = (81 - 30) / 7 = 51 / 7 ≈ 7.29

However, since T must be an integer, we cannot have a fraction of a trouser. This indicates that our assumption about S being 10 might not lead to the maximum number of trousers. Let's check the next integer value for S, which is S = 11:

81 - 3S = 81 - 3(11) = 48, which is also divisible by 7.

Now, calculate T using S = 11:

T = (81 - 3(11)) / 7 = (81 - 33) / 7 = 48 / 7 ≈ 6.86

Again, T must be an integer, so this solution does not work either. We continue checking the next integer values for S until we find a suitable combination that results in an integer value for T and stays within the budget.

After analyzing several values for S, we find that when S = 13:

81 - 3S = 81 - 3(13) = 36, which is divisible by 7.

Calculate T using S = 13:

T = (81 - 3(13)) / 7 = (81 - 39) / 7 = 42 / 7 = 6

Now we have found a valid combination where T = 6 (an integer) and S = 13. The total cost for this combination is:

Cost of trousers = T × 70 = 6 × 70 = 420
Cost of shirts = S × 30 = 13 × 30 = 390
Total cost = 420 + 390 = 810 (matches the budget)

The ratio of trousers to shirts is:

Ratio = T : S = 6 : 13

So, the correct answer is:

(A) 6 Trousers

Question:A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
The merchant has 30 days to pay the invoice and receive a 4% discount, effectively reducing the cost to $19,200 ($20,000 - $20,000 \* 4%). To determine the highest interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to calculate the effective interest rate paid over the 30-day period.

Let I be the interest rate expressed as a decimal:

Effective interest rate over 30 days = (Total interest paid / Principal borrowed) \* (360 days / 30 days)

Since the merchant saves $800 by taking the discount:

Total interest saved = $800

Principal borrowed = $19,200 (the discounted amount)

Now, we can set up the equation:

I = ($800 / $19,200) \* (360 / 30)

Solving for I:

I = 0.04 \* 12
I = 0.48

Converting the decimal to a percentage:

Interest rate = 48%

Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 48%. However, this value is not among the provided answer choices. It seems there might be an error in the question or the answer choices provided. Please verify the correct options or provide additional clarification if needed.

Question:Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer:
Output:
Median income suggests that when arranged in ascending order, the middle value is $3000. Since everyone earns money, the incomes must be symmetrical around the median. Therefore, there must be an even number of earners.

Let's consider the smallest even number of earners that can yield a total income of $9000:

For 2 earners:
If both earn $3000 (the median), then the total income would be $6000, which is less than $9000.

For 4 earners:
If two earners make $3000 (the median) and the other two make more to reach a total of $9000, let x be the additional amount earned by these two earners. Then:

$3000 + $3000 + ($3000 + x) + ($3000 + x) = $9000

Solving for x:

$12000 + 2x = $9000
2x = $9000 - $12000
2x = -$3000
x = -$1500

This result is negative, indicating that it's not possible for four earners with the given median income to reach a total income of $9000 without some earners earning less than the median, which contradicts the premise that all earners have a positive income.

Now, let's consider the next even number of earners:

For 6 earners:
To maintain the median income of $3000, we can distribute the earners' incomes symmetrically around the median. Let's assume three earners make $3000 (the median), and the other three make more to reach a total of $9000. Let y be the additional amount earned by these three earners. Then:

$3000 + $3000 + $3000 + ($3000 + y) + ($3000 + y) + ($3000 + y) = $9000

Solving for y:

$18000 + 3y = $9000
3y = $9000 - $18000
3y = -$9000
y = -$3000

Again, this result is negative, indicating that it's not possible for six earners with the given median income to reach a total income of $9000 without some earners earning less than the median, which contradicts the premise that all earners have a positive income.

We have now considered all even numbers of earners up to 6, and none of them can yield a total income of $9000 while maintaining the median income of $3000 without violating the condition that all earners have a positive income. Thus, there is no valid solution within the given answer choices.

It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the provided answer choices, as they do not allow for a consistent solution based on the given conditions. Please verify the problem statement or provide updated answer choices.

Question:Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the current population of Boomtown as P. According to the problem:

1. Over the next two years, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year. This means after one year, the population will be:
P × (1 + 10%) = P × 1.1

After two years, the population will be:
(P × 1.1) × (1 + 10%) = P × 1.1^2 = P × 1.21

2. It is given that the projected population two years from now (P × 1.21) will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Let's call the population one year ago Y. Then:

P × 1.21 = 2Y

Now, we need to find the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year, which can be expressed as:

Percent Increase = [(Current Population - Last Year's Population) / Last Year's Population] × 100%

In our case, Current Population = P and Last Year's Population = Y. We know that P × 1.21 = 2Y. To express Y in terms of P, we have:

Y = (P × 1.21) / 2 = P × 0.605

The percent increase over the last year is then:

Percent Increase = [(P - P × 0.605) / (P × 0.605)] × 100%
                = [P × (1 - 0.605) / (P × 0.605)] × 100%
                = (1 - 0.605) / 0.605 × 100%
                ≈ 0.395 / 0.605 × 100%
                ≈ 0.653 × 100%
                ≈ 65.3%

Question:In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
Answer:
Output:
The candidate's percentage score when the maximum mark was M can be calculated as:

(504 marks / M marks) × 100%

This percentage remains constant regardless of the maximum mark scale. When the maximum mark is converted to 800 marks, the candidate scores 420 marks, which represents:

(420 marks / 800 marks) × 100% = 52.5%

Setting the two expressions for the candidate's percentage equal, we have:

(504 marks / M marks) × 100% = 52.5%

Now, solve for M:

504 marks / M marks = 52.5 / 100

M marks = (504 marks) / (52.5 / 100)

M marks = (504 marks) × (100 / 52.5)

M marks = 504 marks × 1.9048

M marks ≈ 957.89

Since the number of marks must be a whole number, round M to the nearest whole number:

M ≈ 958

Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the original number as N.

According to the problem statement:
N - 30 = 1/3 N

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3(N - 30) = N
3N - 90 = N
2N = 90

Now, solve for N:
N = 90 / 2
N = 45

We need to find 50% of N:

50% of N = 0.5 × N
           = 0.5 × 45
           = 22.5

Question:At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
Answer:
Output:
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
Where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
r = the annual interest rate (in decimal).
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

Given:
A = $54,080
r = 8% = 0.08
n = 2 (semi-annually)
t = 1 year

We need to find P:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

$54,080 = P(1.04)^2

$54,080 = P(1.0816)

P = $54,080 / 1.0816

P ≈ $50,000

Therefore, Charles originally invested approximately $50,000.

The answer is B.

Answer:
Output:
To express m as a percentage of x, we need to find the value of \(\frac{m}{x}\times 100\).

Given:
\(x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y\)

Now, let's calculate \(\frac{m}{x}\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{m}{x} &= \frac{m}{\left(\frac{m}{100} \times 4y\right)}\\
&= \frac{m \times 100}{m \times 4y}\\
&= \frac{100}{4y}\\
&= \frac{25}{y}
\end{aligned}
\]

Finally, express \(\frac{m}{x}\) as a percentage:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{m}{x} \times 100 &= \frac{25}{y} \times 100\\
&= \frac{2500}{y}
\end{aligned}
\]

So, \(m\) is \(\frac{2500}{y}\) percent of \(x\). The correct answer is (D).

Answer:C The answer is C.

Question:One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
Answer:
Output:
Let x be the amount of health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins. We can set up the following equations based on the percentages provided:

Vitamin E:
x grams contain 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E
∴ (9/100)x = Minimum daily requirement of vitamin E

Vitamin A:
x grams contain 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A
∴ (8/100)x = Minimum daily requirement of vitamin A

Since we need to find the smallest amount of health food that provides at least the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, we can equate each equation to the respective minimum daily requirement:

(9/100)x = Vitamin E minimum daily requirement
(8/100)x = Vitamin A minimum daily requirement

To meet both requirements with the smallest amount of health food, we want to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two vitamin requirements expressed as fractions of x. Since the LCM represents the smallest quantity that satisfies both conditions, we can set each fraction equal to the LCM and solve for x.

Let LCM(9/100, 8/100) represent the LCM of the two vitamin requirements as fractions of x. Then:

(9/100)x = LCM(9/100, 8/100)
(8/100)x = LCM(9/100, 8/100)

Dividing both sides by the corresponding fractions, we get:

x = LCM(9/100, 8/100) / (9/100)
x = LCM(9/100, 8/100) / (8/100)

Since the LCM is the same in both equations, we can conclude that x is equal to the LCM divided by either fraction. Without knowing the specific values of the minimum daily requirements for vitamins E and A, we cannot determine the exact value of x. However, we can observe that the LCM of the fractions 9/100 and 8/100 will be smaller than or equal to the product of the numerators (9 \* 8 = 72), because the denominators are the same (100).

Therefore, the smallest possible value for x that meets both vitamin requirements is when the LCM equals 72/100, which simplifies to 72/100 = 0.72 grams. Thus, the smallest amount of health food needed to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 0.72 grams.

However, since the answer choices are given in whole grams, we round up to the nearest whole gram:

x ≈ 1 gram

So, the correct answer is:

(A) 1 gram

Answer:C The answer is C.

Question:A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
Answer:
Output:
Mohan's share must grow for 2 years at 4% p.a., while Sohan's share only grows for 1 year. To ensure they have equal amounts at age 26, Mohan's share should be less than Sohan's by the difference in growth over those extra years.

For Mohan's share (M), the growth can be calculated as:
M × (1 + 0.04)^2 = M × 1.08^2 = M × 1.1664

For Sohan's share (S), the growth is simply:
S × (1 + 0.04) = S × 1.04

To make their amounts equal at age 26, we set up the equation:

M × 1.1664 = S × 1.04

Since the total sum to be divided is Rs. 5100, we have:

M + S = 5100

We need to find the ratio of Mohan's share (M) to Sohan's share (S). From the growth equation above:

M / S = 1.04 / 1.1664 ≈ 0.8905

Now, let's express their individual shares as a fraction of the total sum:

M / (M + S) = 0.8905 / (0.8905 + 1) ≈ 0.4636
S / (M + S) = 1 / (0.8905 + 1) ≈ 0.5364

Multiplying these fractions by the total sum of Rs. 5100 gives us:

Mohan's Share ≈ 0.4636 × 5100 ≈ Rs. 2363.36
Sohan's Share ≈ 0.5364 × 5100 ≈ Rs. 2736.64

However, since the options provided are rounded whole numbers, we'll round Mohan's share to the nearest whole number:

Mohan's Share ≈ Rs. 2363.36 ≈ Rs. 2363

This value does not match any of the given options. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the options provided. Please verify the information and provide accurate data for a correct solution.

Question:The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
Answer:
Output:
SI = PNR/100
CI = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]
Given:
PNR/100 - P[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] = 72

Solving for R:

Let's substitute P = 5000 and T = 2 into the equation:

5000NR/100 - 5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] = 72

Dividing by 5000:

NR/100 - [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] = 0.144

NR/100 - (1 + 2R/100 + R^2/10000 - 1) = 0.144

NR/100 - (2R/100 + R^2/10000) = 0.144

NR/100 - 2R/100 - R^2/10000 = 0.144

(R/100)(N - 2 - R/100) = 0.144

Since N = 2 (for 2 years), the equation becomes:

(R/100)(2 - 2 - R/100) = 0.144

(R/100)(-R/100) = 0.144

R^2/10000 = 0.144

R^2 = 1440

R = √1440

R = 38

The rate of interest is approximately 38%. However, this is not among the provided choices. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the given answer choices. Please verify the information provided and provide accurate options if necessary.

Question:A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet? Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D)  (13x+1) /24 (E)  (13x-12) /24
Answer:
Output:
Length of fence contributed by pickets = x × (1/2) inch
Number of gaps between pickets = x – 1
Length of fence contributed by gaps = (x – 1) × 6 inch

Total length of the fence = Length of pickets + Length of gaps
= x × (1/2) + (x – 1) × 6
= (x/2) + 6x – 6
= (13x/2) – 6 inches

To convert the length from inches to feet, divide by 12:

Length of fence in feet = [(13x/2) – 6] / 12
= (13x/24) – 0.5 feet

Since the options do not include any negative values or decimal parts for the length, it seems there might be a mistake in the question or the provided answer choices. Please double-check the question and provide the correct answer choices.

Question:The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12
Answer:
Output:
The original length of the ribbon was 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. To find the new length, we need to determine how many parts the original length is divided into and then calculate the length corresponding to the desired proportion.

Original length = 30 cm
Ratio reduction = 5 : 3

First, let's express the original length in terms of the given ratio:

30 cm = 5 parts + 3 parts = 8 parts

Now, we know that the total length corresponds to 8 parts. We want to find the length for 3 parts since the ribbon has been reduced by the 3-part portion of the ratio (from 5 parts to 3 parts).

Length after reduction = Original length × (Desired part / Total parts)
                      = 30 cm × (3 parts / 8 parts)

Let's calculate the new length:

Length after reduction = 30 cm × (3/8) = 30 cm × 0.375 = 11.25 cm

The length of the ribbon after being reduced in the ratio 5 : 3 is 11.25 cm. However, this answer does not match any of the provided choices. There seems to be an error either in the problem statement or the answer choices provided. Please verify the correct options or provide additional clarification if needed.

Question:A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
Answer:
Output:
Number of smaller cubes in the larger cube (excluding the innermost layer): $(5 - 2)^3 = 3^3 = 27$
Each of these 27 smaller cubes has 6 faces, for a total of $27 \times 6 = 162$ faces.
The outer surface of the larger cube consists of 6 faces, each measuring $5 \times 5$. Since each face is covered by $5 \times 5 = 25$ smaller cubes, the total number of faces painted on the outer surface is $6 \times 25 = 150$.

Now, subtract the number of painted faces from the total number of faces on the smaller cubes:

Unpainted faces = Total faces on smaller cubes - Painted faces
Unpainted faces = 162 - 150
Unpainted faces = 12

Therefore, there are 12 faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. However, this does not match any of the given answer choices. Please double-check the question or provide the correct answer choices.

Question:A flagstaff 17.5 metre high casts a shadow of length 40.25 metre. The height of building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions will be : Answer Choices: (A) 12 metre (B) 12.5 metre (C) 13.5 metre (D) 14 metre (E) 15 metre
Answer:
Output:
The ratio of the flagstaff's height to its shadow length is:

Flagstaff height / Shadow length = 17.5 m / 40.25 m

This ratio remains constant for objects casting shadows under similar conditions. Let H be the height of the building. Then, the ratio of the building's height to its shadow length is:

Building height / Shadow length = H m / 28.75 m

Since both ratios are equal, we can set up the following proportion:

17.5 m / 40.25 m = H m / 28.75 m

Now, solve for H:

H = (17.5 m × 28.75 m) / 40.25 m

H = 12.5 m

The height of the building is 12.5 meters.

Question:When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the length (L) and width (W) of the rectangular sheet.

Case 1: Folded along one set of sides:
Each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. Since they are equal halves, each half will have one side with length L/2 and another side with width W. Thus, the perimeter of one half is:

(L/2) + W + (L/2) + W = 48

Simplifying, we get:

L + 2W = 48 (Equation 1)

Case 2: Folded along the other set of sides:
Each half has a perimeter of 66 cm. In this case, each half will have one side with length W/2 and another side with width L. Thus, the perimeter of one half is:

(W/2) + L + (W/2) + L = 66

Simplifying, we get:

L + 2W/2 = 66

L + W = 66 (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of equations:

Equation 1: L + 2W = 48
Equation 2: L + W = 66

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, we eliminate L:

(2W - W) = 48 - 66
W = -18

This result doesn't make sense because the width cannot be negative. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the provided answer choices. Please double-check the information and provide a corrected version of the question if necessary. I'll be happy to help you solve it once it's revised.

Question:A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as b meters. According to the problem:

Length = 4b + 1

The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m:

Area = Length × Breadth
150 = (4b + 1) × b

Now, solve for b:

150 = 4b^2 + b
4b^2 + b - 150 = 0

This is a quadratic equation. We can factorize it or use the quadratic formula to find the value of b. After solving, we get two possible values for b:

b ≈ 3.82 m or b ≈ -5.82 m

Since the breadth cannot be negative, we choose b ≈ 3.82 m.

Now, calculate the length:

Length = 4b + 1
Length ≈ 4 × 3.82 + 1
Length ≈ 15.28 m

Finally, determine the perimeter of the rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Breadth)
Perimeter ≈ 2 × (15.28 + 3.82)
Perimeter ≈ 2 × 19.1
Perimeter ≈ 38.2 m

However, the provided answer choices do not include 38.2 m. There seems to be an error either in the problem statement or the answer choices provided. Please verify the information and provide accurate options for me to give you the correct answer.

Question:A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
Answer:
Output:
Let's denote the length (unpainted side) as L and the width (painted sides) as W. We know:

L = 9 feet
W + W + L = 37 feet

Substituting the known value for L:
W + W + 9 = 37

Combining like terms:
2W = 37 - 9
2W = 28

Dividing by 2 to find W:
W = 28 / 2
W = 14 feet

Now we have both dimensions of the rectangle:

Length (L) = 9 feet
Width (W) = 14 feet

The area (A) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
A = L × W

Plugging in the values:
A = 9 feet × 14 feet
A = 126 square feet

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet.

Question:The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
Answer:
Output:
Volume of cube = a^3
Volume of sphere = 4/3πr^3

Since the sphere fits inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube:
diameter = 2r = a

Therefore, r = a/2

Now let's calculate the ratio of the volumes:

Ratio = (Volume of cube) / (Volume of sphere)
       = (a^3) / (4/3π(a/2)^3)
       = (a^3) / [(4/3π)(a^3)/(8)]
       = (a^3) × (8/(4/3π))
       = (a^3) × (6π/4)
       = (a^3) × (3π/2)

So, the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

(A) 2: π

The answer is A.
