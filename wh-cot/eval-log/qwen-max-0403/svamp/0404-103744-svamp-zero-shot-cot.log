Question:29 campers went rowing and 66 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many campers went rowing in the morning:

Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 29

Next, we know that 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

Now, to find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon, we subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number who went rowing in the morning:

Difference = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning - Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon
Difference = 29 - 26

Calculating this difference gives us:

Difference = 3

Therefore, there were 3 more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.

Question:53 campers went rowing in the morning 48 campers went rowing in the afternoon and 49 campers went rowing in the evening. How many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the evening?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the evening from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning.

Given:
Morning rowers = 53 campers
Evening rowers = 49 campers

Difference in number of campers:

Difference = Morning rowers - Evening rowers
           = 53 campers - 49 campers
           = 4 campers

Question:2 birds were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
There are initially 2 birds on the fence.

5 more birds come to join, so now there are:

Initial birds + Additional birds = Total birds
2 + 5 = 7 birds

4 storks also come to join. Now, we want to find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence. We already know there are 7 birds. So, let's calculate the difference between the number of birds and the number of storks:

Difference = Birds - Storks
Difference = 7 birds - 4 storks

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

Question:The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students going on the field trip.

We know that there are 58 students in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students. Since there are 87 classrooms, we can find the number of students per classroom by dividing the total number of students by the number of classrooms:

Number of students per classroom = Total number of students / Number of classrooms
                                      = 58 students / 87 classrooms

However, this calculation doesn't make sense because it implies that there are fewer students than classrooms, which is unlikely. It seems there might be a mistake in the provided information. Please clarify the correct number of students or the relationship between the number of students and classrooms.

Once we have the correct number of students going on the field trip, we can proceed to Step 2:

Step 2: Determine the total number of buses needed.

To find out how many buses are needed, divide the total number of students by the seating capacity of each bus (2 seats):

Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Seats per bus

After performing this calculation, we will have the integer value representing the minimum number of buses required for the field trip. If there is any remainder, an additional bus may be needed to accommodate all students. Round up to the next whole number in such cases.

Please provide the correct number of students or clarify the relationship between the number of students and classrooms so that we can accurately calculate the number of buses needed for the field trip.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
Unable to determine due to incorrect or inconsistent information provided. Please provide the correct number of students or clarify the relationship between the number of students and classrooms.

Question:22 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 2 children altogether on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we know that there were initially 22 children riding on the bus.

Next, at the bus stop, 40 children got on the bus. This increases the number of children on the bus:

Initial children on the bus + Children getting on = Total after children get on
22 + 40 = 62

Now, we are told that there were 2 children altogether on the bus after this exchange (some getting off and others getting on). To find out how many children got off, we can subtract the final total number of children from the number of children who were on the bus after the 40 got on:

Children who got off = Initial total after getting on - Final total
Children who got off = 62 - 2

Let's do the calculation:

Children who got off = 62 - 2 = 60

So, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Danny starts with some initial number of bottle caps in his collection. We'll call this number X.

1. Danny throws away 60 old bottle caps.
   His collection now has X - 60 bottle caps.

2. He finds 58 new bottle caps.
   His collection now has (X - 60) + 58 bottle caps.

3. It is given that he now has a total of 67 bottle caps in his collection.

So, we can set up an equation based on these steps:

(X - 60) + 58 = 67

Now, let's solve for X to find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first.

Step 1: Simplify the left side of the equation:
X - 60 + 58 = 67
X - 2 = 67

Step 2: Add 2 to both sides to isolate X:
X = 67 + 2
X = 69

Question:He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 76 sacks per day and discard 64 of them. How many oranges do they harvest per day if each sack contains 50 oranges?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate the total number of oranges harvested daily considering that there are 76 sacks harvested per day and each sack contains 50 oranges:

Total oranges = Number of sacks × Oranges per sack

Total oranges = 76 sacks × 50 oranges/sack

Now, we'll compute this value.

Total oranges = 76 × 50 = 3800

So, they harvest a total of 3,800 oranges per day.

Next, you mentioned that they discard 64 of these sacks. However, it seems like there might be an error or inconsistency in the information provided, as discarding a specific number of sacks (instead of a percentage or a certain amount of oranges) doesn't directly affect the total number of oranges harvested unless we know how many oranges are in those discarded sacks.

If the intention was to say that they discard a certain number of oranges, please provide the correct information so I can recalculate the total number of oranges kept after discarding the specified amount.

If the statement about discarding 64 sacks is indeed accurate and you want to know the total number of oranges harvested before any discarding takes place, the answer is 3,800 oranges per day. If you could clarify the intended meaning or provide the correct data for the discarded oranges, I would be happy to help you with the revised calculation.

Question:Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate Lewis' weekly earnings after paying rent.

Lewis earns $491 per week, and he needs to pay $216 for rent each week. To find out how much money he has left after covering his rent expense:

Weekly earnings after rent = Weekly earnings - Rent
                             = $491 - $216
                             = $275

So, Lewis has $275 remaining each week after paying rent.

Step 2: Determine Lewis' total earnings over the 1181 weeks of the harvest season.

To calculate Lewis' total earnings for the entire harvest season, multiply his weekly earnings after rent by the number of weeks:

Total earnings = Weekly earnings after rent × Number of weeks
               = $275 × 1181

Step 3: Perform the multiplication to find the total earnings.

Let's compute the product:

Total earnings = $275 × 1181
               = $326,375

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Tiffany started with 7 bags of cans on Monday.

The next day, she found an additional 12 bags worth of cans.

To determine how many more bags she found on the next day compared to what she had on Monday, we simply subtract the number of bags she had on Monday from the number of bags she found the next day:

Number of bags found on the next day - Number of bags on Monday = Difference

So,

12 bags (found the next day) - 7 bags (on Monday) = Difference

Question:He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges per day. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 26 days of harvest?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find the total number of sacks of oranges harvested after 26 days, we need to calculate:

1. The total number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested over 26 days.
2. The total number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested over 26 days.
3. Add the totals from steps 1 and 2 to get the combined total for both ripe and unripe oranges.

Given:
- Number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day = 28
- Number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day = 52
- Total number of harvest days = 26

Step 1: Calculate total sacks of ripe oranges (26 days)
Total ripe oranges = Ripe oranges per day × Number of days
Total ripe oranges = 28 sacks/day × 26 days

Step 2: Calculate total sacks of unripe oranges (26 days)
Total unripe oranges = Unripe oranges per day × Number of days
Total unripe oranges = 52 sacks/day × 26 days

Step 3: Combine the totals from steps 1 and 2
Total sacks of oranges = Total ripe oranges + Total unripe oranges

Now, let's perform the calculations:

Step 1:
Total ripe oranges = 28 sacks/day × 26 days = 728 sacks

Step 2:
Total unripe oranges = 52 sacks/day × 26 days = 1352 sacks

Step 3:
Total sacks of oranges = 728 sacks (ripe) + 1352 sacks (unripe) = 2080 sacks

Answer: After 26 days of harvest, they will have a total of 2,080 sacks of oranges (1,352 sacks of unripe oranges and 728 sacks of ripe oranges).

Question:The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 23 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they made $ 230 by selling t-shirts. How many t-shirts did they sell?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The Razorback t-shirt shop earns a profit of $23 per t-shirt sold. They accumulated a total profit of $230 during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game from t-shirt sales. To find out how many t-shirts were sold, we can divide the total profit by the profit per t-shirt:

Profit per t-shirt = $23

Number of t-shirts sold = Total profit ÷ Profit per t-shirt
                           = $230 ÷ $23
                           = 10

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the total number of chairs available with the existing sets.

They have 4 sets of tables, and each set has 3 chairs. To find the total number of chairs:

Total chairs = Number of sets × Chairs per set

Total chairs = 4 sets × 3 chairs/set

Total chairs = 12 chairs

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional chairs needed based on the number of attendees.

There will be 14 people attending the party, and each person needs one chair. To determine how many more chairs they need to buy:

Additional chairs needed = Total attendees - Available chairs

Additional chairs needed = 14 people - 12 chairs

Additional chairs needed = 2 chairs

Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we know there were originally 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase.

Next, we're told that there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase.

To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we need to determine the difference between the number of orchids before and after she added more from her garden:

Original number of orchids + Orchids cut = Total number of orchids now

Let O represent the number of orchids cut. We can write the equation as follows:

2 + O = 21

Answer: Let's think step by step.
John needs:

1. For the large planks:
   - He has 12 large planks.
   - Each large plank requires a certain number of nails.
   - It is given that all large planks together need 15 pieces of nails.

2. For the small planks:
   - He has 10 small planks.
   - Each small plank requires a certain number of nails.
   - It is given that all small planks together need 5 nails.

To find the total number of nails John needs for the house wall, we simply add the number of nails needed for the large planks to the number of nails needed for the small planks:

Total nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for small planks
             = 15 (for large planks) + 5 (for small planks)

Now, let's calculate the total:

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To determine how many more movies than books there are in the 'Crazy Silly School' series, we need to calculate the total number of movies and books separately, then find the difference between them.

Given:
Total number of movies = 17
Total number of books = 11

You have read 13 books and watched 63 movies. However, these numbers exceed the total available for each category (there are only 11 books and 17 movies in the series). It seems like there might be a mistake in the information provided. Assuming the totals given for the series are correct, let's proceed with those figures:

Now, let's find the difference between the total number of movies and the total number of books:

Difference = Total number of movies - Total number of books

Substituting the given values:

Difference = 17 movies - 11 books

Calculating the difference:

Difference = 6 movies

There should be 7 action figures on the shelf after this step, but we're told that there are actually 6 action figures on the shelf now. This means Jerry must have removed some of the action figures:

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the candy bars.

Dan bought 99 candy bars, and each candy bar costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of candy bars by their individual price:

Total cost = Number of candy bars × Price per candy bar
Total cost = 99 × $3

Step 2: Perform the multiplication to determine the total cost.

Total cost = 99 × $3 = $297

Step 3: Determine how much money Dan has left after buying the candy bars.

Dan initially had $4. We subtract the total cost of the candy bars from his initial amount to find out how much money he has left:

Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $4 - $297

Step 4: Perform the subtraction to calculate the remaining money.

Money left = $4 - $297 = -$293

Answer: After buying 99 candy bars at $3 each, Dan has -$293 left. This negative amount indicates that Dan does not have enough money to cover the cost of the candy bars; he is short by $293. In reality, he would not be able to make this purchase with only $4. However, based on the provided information and calculations, this is the mathematical result.

Number of customers who left = Initial customers - Customers who stayed

Number of customers who left = 11 - 3

Number of customers who left = 8

Now, we need to determine how many more customers left than those who stayed behind:

Difference = Number of customers who left - Number of customers who stayed

Difference = 8 - 3

Difference = 5

Answer: 5 more customers left than those who stayed behind.

Question:Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends How many cakes did each person eat?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Matthew had a total of 29 crackers and 30 cakes.

He gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends, meaning he distributed the snacks equally among three people (himself and two friends).

First, let's find out how many crackers and cakes each person received:

Total number of snacks (crackers + cakes) = 29 crackers + 30 cakes = 59 snacks

Number of people = Matthew + 2 friends = 3 people

Snacks per person = Total number of snacks / Number of people

Now, we'll calculate the number of snacks each person received:

Snacks per person = 59 snacks / 3 people

Next, since we know that each person received an equal number of crackers and cakes, the number of cakes each person ate will be half of the total snacks they received:

Cakes per person = Snacks per person / 2

Let's do the calculations:

Snacks per person = 59 snacks / 3 people = 19.67 snacks (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we can't have a fraction of a snack, we'll round this down to the nearest whole number because we can't distribute a fraction of a cake or cracker. In this case, rounding down to 19 snacks seems appropriate.

Cakes per person = 19 snacks / 2 = 9.5 cakes (rounded to one decimal place)

Again, since we can't have a fraction of a cake, we'll round this down to the nearest whole number, which is 9 cakes.

Therefore, each person, including Matthew and his two friends, ate 9 cakes.

Answer: Each person ate 9 cakes.

9

Question:There are 11 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. How many peaches are in the baskets altogether?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the total number of red peaches.

We know that each basket contains 10 red peaches, and there are 11 baskets in total. To find the total number of red peaches, we multiply the number of red peaches per basket by the number of baskets:

Total red peaches = Number of red peaches per basket × Number of baskets
Total red peaches = 10 red peaches × 11 baskets

Step 2: Calculate the total number of green peaches.

Similarly, each basket contains 18 green peaches, and there are 11 baskets in total. We'll calculate the total number of green peaches as follows:

Total green peaches = Number of green peaches per basket × Number of baskets
Total green peaches = 18 green peaches × 11 baskets

Step 3: Sum up the total red and green peaches to get the overall total.

Now that we have the total number of red and green peaches, we add them together to find the total number of peaches in all the baskets:

Total peaches = Total red peaches + Total green peaches

Let's perform these calculations.

Step 1:
Total red peaches = 10 red peaches × 11 baskets = 10 × 11 = 110 red peaches

Step 2:
Total green peaches = 18 green peaches × 11 baskets = 18 × 11 = 198 green peaches

Step 3:
Total peaches = Total red peaches + Total green peaches = 110 red peaches + 198 green peaches = 110 + 198 = 308 peaches

Answer: There are a total of 308 peaches in the 11 baskets altogether.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The grasshopper jumped 39 inches.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog. This means we need to subtract 19 inches from the grasshopper's jump distance to find the frog's jump distance:

Frog's jump distance = Grasshopper's jump distance - 19 inches
Frog's jump distance = 39 inches - 19 inches
Frog's jump distance = 20 inches

The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. To find the mouse's jump distance, we need to subtract 12 inches from the frog's jump distance:

Mouse's jump distance = Frog's jump distance - 12 inches
Mouse's jump distance = 20 inches - 12 inches
Mouse's jump distance = 8 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches in the contest.

Question:Robin's hair was 14 inches long. It grew by 8 inches. Then he cut off 20 inches. How long is his hair now?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we'll consider the growth of Robin's hair:

Initial length: 14 inches
Growth: +8 inches

New length after growth = Initial length + Growth
New length after growth = 14 inches + 8 inches
New length after growth = 22 inches

Next, we'll account for the haircut:

Length after growth: 22 inches
Cut off: -20 inches

Final length after haircut = Length after growth - Cut off
Final length after haircut = 22 inches - 20 inches
Final length after haircut = 2 inches

So, Robin's hair is now 2 inches long.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
2 inches.

Question:The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches.

Next, the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper. To find the distance the frog jumped, we add the grasshopper's jump distance to the additional 10 inches:

Grasshopper's jump = 19 inches
Frog's additional distance = 10 inches

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + Frog's additional distance
              = 19 inches + 10 inches
              = 29 inches

Now, we have determined that the frog jumped 29 inches.

The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. To find the distance the mouse jumped, we add the frog's jump distance to the additional 20 inches:

Frog's jump = 29 inches
Mouse's additional distance = 20 inches

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump + Mouse's additional distance
             = 29 inches + 20 inches
             = 49 inches

Finally, we need to determine how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper. We subtract the grasshopper's jump distance from the mouse's jump distance:

Mouse's jump = 49 inches
Grasshopper's jump = 19 inches

Difference = Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump
            = 49 inches - 19 inches
            = 30 inches

Answer: The mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 4 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds.

Step 2: We also know that together, Marco's strawberries and his dad's strawberries weighed a total of 4 pounds.

Step 3: To find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weighed, we subtract Marco's strawberries weight from the combined weight:

Total weight - Marco's strawberries weight = Dad's strawberries weight

4 pounds - 19 pounds = Dad's strawberries weight

Step 4: However, this calculation results in a negative number (-15 pounds), which is not possible for the weight of strawberries. It seems there might be an error in the provided information. The weight of Marco's strawberries (19 pounds) exceeds the combined weight (4 pounds), which doesn't make logical sense.

In conclusion, based on the given information, it is impossible to determine how much more Marco's strawberries weigh than his dad's due to conflicting data. Please provide corrected weights or clarify the situation for a valid solution.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To determine how many more grams of wax our subject needs, we can simply subtract the amount of wax they currently have from the total amount required for sticking the feathers together.

Given:
Total amount of wax needed = 166 g
Current amount of wax available = 20 g

Now, let's calculate the additional wax needed:

Additional wax needed = Total amount of wax needed - Current amount of wax available
                      = 166 g - 20 g

Question:Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Initially, Marco and his dad collected strawberries weighing a total of 36 pounds.

Step 2: While returning, they lost 8 pounds of strawberries. This loss affects both their combined collection:

Total weight after losing 8 pounds = Initial total weight - Lost weight
Total weight after losing 8 pounds = 36 pounds - 8 pounds
Total weight after losing 8 pounds = 28 pounds

Step 3: After the loss, Marco's strawberries now weigh 12 pounds. We need to find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh now. Since we know the updated total weight (28 pounds) and Marco's portion (12 pounds), we can calculate his dad's portion as follows:

Dad's strawberries weight now = Updated total weight - Marco's strawberries weight now
Dad's strawberries weight now = 28 pounds - 12 pounds
Dad's strawberries weight now = 16 pounds

Answer: Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 16 pounds.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the frog's jump distance.
Since the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, we can find the frog's jump distance by subtracting 25 inches from the grasshopper's jump distance:

Frog's jump distance = Grasshopper's jump distance - 25 inches
Frog's jump distance = 21 inches - 25 inches
Frog's jump distance = -4 inches

Question:Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, let's determine how much more flour Mary needs to add to reach the required amount:

Total flour needed (according to the recipe) - Flour already added = Flour still needed
14 cups - 5 cups = 9 cups

Now, let's calculate how much sugar Mary needs to add according to the recipe:

Sugar needed (according to the recipe) = Total sugar called for - Sugar already added
Since we know that Mary hasn't added any sugar yet, this simplifies to:
Sugar needed = 6 cups - 0 cups = 6 cups

Finally, let's find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add now:

Flour still needed - Sugar needed = Difference
9 cups - 6 cups = 3 cups

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the total amount of sugar needed according to the recipe.
The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar.

Step 2: Determine how much flour Mary has already added.
She has already put in 11 cups of flour.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of flour needed according to the recipe.
The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, so she needs:
14 cups (total) - 11 cups (already added) = 3 cups (remaining)

Step 4: Compare the amounts of sugar and flour Mary still needs to add.
Sugar: She needs to add 5 cups (the entire amount called for in the recipe).
Flour: She needs to add 3 cups (the remaining amount after what she has already added).

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the amounts of sugar and flour she needs to add.
Difference = Sugar needed - Flour needed
Difference = 5 cups - 3 cups
Difference = 2 cups

Question:Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, let's determine how much of each ingredient Mary still needs to add based on the recipe:

1. Flour: Recipe calls for 6 cups, and she has already added 5 cups.
   Remaining flour needed = Total required - Flour added
   = 6 cups - 5 cups
   = 1 cup

2. Sugar: Recipe calls for 8 cups.
   Since she hasn't added any sugar yet, the remaining sugar needed is:
   = 8 cups

3. Salt: Recipe calls for 7 cups.
   Like sugar, she hasn't added any salt yet, so the remaining salt needed is:
   = 7 cups

Now we want to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt Mary needs to add:

Difference between sugar and salt needed = Sugar needed - Salt needed
= 8 cups - 7 cups
= 1 cup

Answer: Mary needs to add 1 more cup of sugar than cups of salt.

Question:Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, we know that Mary needs a total of 6 cups of flour according to the recipe.

Second, it's mentioned that she has already put in some cups of flour but the exact amount is not specified. However, we are told that she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.

Third, the recipe requires 13 cups of sugar. Since Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar:

Flour needed = Sugar needed + 8 cups

Substituting the known value for sugar:
Flour needed = 13 cups + 8 cups
Flour needed = 21 cups

Now, let's calculate how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add:

Additional flour needed = Total flour needed - Flour already added
Given that the total flour needed is 21 cups and the amount of flour already added is unknown, we cannot compute the exact number of additional cups of flour Mary needs to add with the information provided.

However, if we assume that "she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar" refers to the difference between what she has already added and what she still needs to add (which seems unlikely based on the context), then we can infer that she has already added:

Flour already added = Sugar needed - 8 cups
Flour already added = 13 cups - 8 cups
Flour already added = 5 cups

In this case, Additional flour needed would be:

Additional flour needed = Total flour needed - Flour already added
Additional flour needed = 21 cups - 5 cups
Additional flour needed = 16 cups

But again, this interpretation is inconsistent with the context and most likely incorrect. Without knowing the specific amount of flour Mary has already added, we cannot accurately determine how many more cups of flour she needs to add to reach the required 6 cups.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
Unknown due to insufficient information regarding the amount of flour Mary has already added.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, let's determine how much more flour Mary needs to add to reach the required amount:

Total flour needed = 10 cups
Flour already added = 7 cups

Flour still needed = Total flour needed - Flour already added

Now, let's calculate how much sugar Mary needs to add according to the recipe:

Sugar needed = 2 cups

Since Mary has not yet added any sugar (as per the information provided), the amount of sugar she needs to add remains 2 cups.

Finally, we'll find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add now:

Question:Frank was reading through his favorite book. He read 8 pages per day. If the book had 576 pages How many days did he take to finish the book?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many days Frank took to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of pages he reads per day:

Total pages in the book = 576 pages
Pages read per day = 8 pages

Days to finish the book = Total pages in the book ÷ Pages read per day

Now, let's do the calculation:

Days to finish the book = 576 pages ÷ 8 pages/day

Days to finish the book = 72 days

Answer: Frank took 72 days to finish reading his favorite book.

Question:Every day Ryan spends 6 hours on learning english and 2 hours on learning chinese. How many more hours does he spend on learning english than he does on learning chinese?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Ryan spends:
- 6 hours on learning English
- 2 hours on learning Chinese

To find out how many more hours Ryan spends on learning English than he does on learning Chinese, we subtract the number of hours spent on learning Chinese from the number of hours spent on learning English:

Extra hours on English = Hours on English - Hours on Chinese
                      = 6 hours - 2 hours
                      = 4 hours

Question:Ryan learns english and chinese for 7 days. Every day he spends 4 hours on learning english and 5 hours on learning chinese. How many hours does he spend on learning english and chinese in all?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total hours spent on English per week.
Ryan spends 4 hours learning English every day for 7 days. To find the weekly total, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days:

Total hours on English = Daily hours × Number of days
Total hours on English = 4 hours/day × 7 days

Step 2: Calculate the total hours spent on Chinese per week.
Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese every day for 7 days. We follow the same process as above:

Total hours on Chinese = Daily hours × Number of days
Total hours on Chinese = 5 hours/day × 7 days

Step 3: Sum up the total hours spent on both English and Chinese.
To find the overall total hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese combined, we add the totals from Step 1 and Step 2:

Total hours on English and Chinese = Total hours on English + Total hours on Chinese

Now let's perform the calculations.

Step 1:
Total hours on English = 4 hours/day × 7 days = 28 hours

Step 2:
Total hours on Chinese = 5 hours/day × 7 days = 35 hours

Step 3:
Total hours on English and Chinese = 28 hours (English) + 35 hours (Chinese) = 63 hours

Answer: Ryan spends a total of 63 hours learning English and Chinese in all.

Question:Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To determine how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days it took Frank to finish the book.
2. Divide the total number of chapters in the book by the total number of days.

Given:
Total number of pages = 193
Number of chapters = 15
Total number of days to finish the book = 660

Step 1 is already provided (Total number of days = 660).

Now, let's perform Step 2:

Chapters read per day = Number of chapters / Total number of days

Chapters read per day = 15 / 660

Chapters read per day = 0.0227 (rounded to four decimal places)

Since it's not reasonable for Frank to read a fraction of a chapter per day, we can conclude that he read **one chapter** per day on average. This result makes sense considering the large number of days it took him to complete the book and the relatively small number of chapters.

Answer: Frank read **one chapter** per day.

Question:Frank was reading through some books. Each book had 249 pages and it took Frank 3 days to finish each book. How many pages did he read per day?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the total number of pages Frank reads for one book.
Since each book has 249 pages, we can simply state:

Total pages per book = 249

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Frank reads per day.
It takes Frank 3 days to finish one book. To find out how many pages he reads per day, we divide the total pages per book by the number of days it takes him to complete that book:

Pages per day = Total pages per book / Days to finish one book
                = 249 / 3

Step 3: Perform the calculation.
Now, let's compute the division:

Pages per day = 249 / 3 = 83

Answer: Frank reads 83 pages per day.

Question:Frank was reading through some books. Each book had 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to finish each book. If he takes 492 days to finish all books How many books did he read?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
To determine how many books Frank read, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pages Frank read during the 492 days.
2. Divide this total number of pages by the number of pages per book.

Let's start with step 1:

Total number of pages read = Total time spent reading (in days) × Pages read per day

We know that Frank reads one book in 12 days, which means he reads 66 pages every 12 days. To find out how many pages he reads in a single day, we divide the number of pages in a book by the number of days it takes him to finish it:

Pages read per day = Number of pages per book ÷ Time to finish one book (in days)

Now we can calculate the total number of pages Frank read during the 492 days:

Total number of pages read = 492 days × Pages read per day

Step 2:

Number of books read = Total number of pages read ÷ Number of pages per book

Let's perform these calculations:

Pages read per day = 66 pages ÷ 12 days = 5.5 pages/day

Total number of pages read = 492 days × 5.5 pages/day = 2706 pages

Number of books read = 2706 pages ÷ 66 pages/book = 41 books

Answer: Frank read 41 books.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
To find out how many pages are in each chapter of Frank's book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters.

Total number of pages = 555
Number of chapters = 5

Pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters

Question:Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, let's determine the total number of pages in the book:

The book has 2 chapters, and each chapter has 405 pages.

Total number of pages = Number of chapters × Pages per chapter
                      = 2 × 405
                      = 810 pages

Now, we know that Frank took 664 days to finish the entire book. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the number of days it took him to read the book.

There are 2 chapters in the book, and Frank took 664 days to complete them.

Chapters read per day = Total number of chapters / Number of days
                     = 2 / 664

However, since a fraction of a chapter cannot be read, the answer must be expressed as a whole number. In this case, Frank read 0 chapters per day because he could not complete even one chapter within a single day. 

Therefore, Frank read 0 chapters per day.
