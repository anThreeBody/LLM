Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this problem. Let's call the 3-digit number N = 100x + 10y + z, where x, y, and z are the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively.
From the given information, we know that:
2272 ≡ 875 (mod N)
This means that:
2272 - 875 = kN
where k is some integer.
Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
1397 = kN
Now, we need to find all possible values of k such that 1397 is divisible by N. We can do this by listing out the factors of 1397 and checking which ones have three digits.
The prime factorization of 1397 is:
1397 = 11 * 127
So, the factors of 1397 are:
1, 11, 127, 1397
Out of these, only 127 has three digits. Therefore, N must be a multiple of 127.
Now, we can use the fact that 2272 ≡ 875 (mod N) to find the value of N. We can rewrite this equation as:
2272 - 875 = k(100x + 10y + z)
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
1397 = 100kx + 10ky + kz
Since N is a multiple of 127, we know that k must be a multiple of 127 as well. Let's say k = 127m for some integer m.
Substituting this into the above equation, we get:
1397 = 12700mx + 1270my + 127mz
Dividing both sides by 127, we get:
11 = 100mx + 10my + mz
Now, we need to find all possible values of x, y, and z such that this equation holds true. Since 11 is a prime number, we know that at least one of x, y, or z must be equal to 1.
Let's assume that x = 1. Then, we have:
11 = 100m + 10y + z
Substituting this into the original equation, we get:
2272 - 875 = 127m(100x + 10y + z)
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
1397 = 127m(100 + 10y + z)
Dividing both sides by 127, we get:
11 = 100m + 10y + z
Since x = 1, we also know that:
100x + 10y + z = 100 + 10y + z = 11
Therefore, we have:
11 = 100m + 10y + z = 100m + 10(1) + z
Substituting this into the above equation, we get:
11 = 100m + 10 + z
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:
1 = 100m + z
Since z must be an integer between 0 and 9, we have only two possibilities for z: z = 0 or z = 1.
If z = 0, then we have:
1 = 100m
which implies that m = 1/100, which is not an integer.
Therefore, we must have z = 1. Substituting this into the above equation, we get:
1 = 100m + 1
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
0 = 100m
which implies that m = 0.
Therefore, we have:
x = 1, y = 0, z = 1
Substituting these values into the expression for N, we get:
N = 100x + 10y + z = 100 + 10(0) + 1 = 101
So, the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
Therefore, the answer is (B).

Question:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can start by simplifying the equation given in the problem:

M - N + 396c = 990

Since M = abc and N = cba, we can substitute these expressions into the equation:

abc - cba + 396c = 990

Simplifying this expression, we get:

a - b + 396 = 990

Subtracting 396 from both sides, we get:

a - b = 594

Now we know that the difference between the digits a and b is 594. Since a and b are digits, they must be between 1 and 9 inclusive. Therefore, there are 9 possible values for a and 9 possible values for b, giving us a total of 81 possible pairs of digits (since a and b cannot be equal).

For each pair of digits (a, b), there are 10 possible values for c (since c is a digit). Therefore, there are a total of 81 x 10 = 810 possible values for the three-digit number M.

To find out how many of these values are greater than 300, we need to count the number of pairs of digits (a, b) such that a + b + c > 300. We can do this by listing all possible pairs of digits (a, b) and checking whether their sum plus c is greater than 300.

There are several ways to approach this task, but one efficient method is to use a spreadsheet or calculator to generate a table of all possible pairs of digits (a, b) and their corresponding sums (a + b). We can then filter the table to show only those rows where the sum is greater than 300.

Using this method, we find that there are 200 pairs of digits (a, b) such that a + b > 300. For each of these pairs, there are 10 possible values for c, so there are a total of 200 x 10 = 2000 three-digit numbers M with digits (a, b, c) such that a + b + c > 300.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 200.

Question:If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:


Without knowing the specific value of Q, we can make some general statements based on its number of factors.

Since Q has 5 factors, it must be divisible by 1 and itself (which are always factors), as well as two other distinct prime factors. Let's call these prime factors p and q.

Therefore, we can write Q = p^2 * q, where p and q are distinct primes.

From this expression, we can see that:

- Q cannot be a perfect square, since a perfect square always has an even number of factors.
- Q must have at least one odd factor (p or q) and one even factor (q).
- The sum of the digits of Q must be even, since the only way to get an odd sum of digits is if there is an odd number of odd digits, but Q has an even number of factors.

Based on these observations, we can eliminate options A, B, C, and D, leaving us with option E as the correct answer:

E. None of the above.

Question:Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can set up a system of equations to solve this problem:

Let J = Joe's current age
Let S = Joe's sister's current age
Let F = Joe's father's current age

From the first sentence, we know that:
J + S + F = 100

From the second sentence, we know that:
When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
So, at some point in the future, we have:
J = F
S = 2S

Substituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:
F + 2S + F = 100
2F + 2S = 100
F + S = 50

From the third sentence, we know that:
When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
So, at some point in the past, we had:
F = 2(S - J)
F = 2S - 2J

Substituting this expression for F into the equation F + S = 50, we get:
2S - 2J + S = 50
3S - 2J = 50

Now we have two equations with two variables:
J + S + F = 100
3S - 2J = 50

We can use substitution or elimination to solve for J and S. Let's use substitution. Solving the second equation for S, we get:
S = (2J + 50)/3

Substituting this expression for S into the first equation, we get:
J + ((2J + 50)/3) + F = 100
(5J + 50)/3 + F = 100
5J + 50 + 3F = 300
5J + 3F = 250

Now we have two equations with two variables:
J + S + F = 100
5J + 3F = 250

We can use substitution again to solve for J and F. Solving the second equation for F, we get:
F = (250 - 5J)/3

Substituting this expression for F into the first equation, we get:
J + ((2J + 50)/3) + ((250 - 5J)/3) = 100
J + (2J + 50)/3 + (250 - 5J)/3 = 100
J + (2J + 50 + 250 - 5J)/3 = 100
J + (300 - 3J)/3 = 100
J + 100 - J = 100
0 = 0

This means that the system of equations has infinitely many solutions. However, we know that Joe, his sister, and his father must all be real people, so there must be a unique solution that satisfies all three conditions.

To find the unique solution, we can use trial and error. We know that Joe's current age is less than 100, so let's try each of the answer choices until we find one that works.

(A) If Joe's current age is 45, then his sister's current age is 55 and his father's current age is 50. This doesn't work because when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as now, which would make her 110, not 100.

(B) If Joe's current age is 48, then his sister's current age is 52 and his father's current age is 50. This works because when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as now, which would make her 104, and when Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father, which would make him 100.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to solve this problem. Let x be the first term of the sequence (the age of the youngest member), and let n be the number of terms in the sequence (the number of members in the club). Then we have:

x + (x+3) + (x+6) + ... + (x+3(n-1)) = 250

Simplifying this expression, we get:

nx + 3(1+2+...+(n-1)) = 250

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we know that 1+2+...+(n-1) = (n-1)(n)/2. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

nx + 3(n-1)(n)/2 = 250

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2nx + 3(n-1)n = 500

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

2nx + 3n^2 - 3n = 500

Rearranging, we get:

2nx + 3n^2 - 3n - 500 = 0

Dividing both sides by 2n, we get:

x + 3/2*n - 3/2 - 250/n = 0

Since x is the age of the youngest member, it must be a positive integer. Also, since the common difference between ages is 3 months, the ages of the members must be multiples of 3. Therefore, we can try values of n that are factors of 250 and see if they give us a valid solution.

The prime factorization of 250 is 2*5^3, so the possible values of n are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 125. We can check each of these values to see if they give us a valid solution.

For n=1, we have:

x + 3/2 - 3/2 - 250 = 0

This simplifies to:

x = 250

This is not a valid solution, since the age of the youngest member cannot be 250.

For n=2, we have:

x + 3 - 3/2 - 125 = 0

This simplifies to:

x = 121

This is a valid solution, since the age of the youngest member is 7 years old and the common difference between ages is 3 months. Therefore, there are 2 members in the club.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the fact that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers equals the product of the two numbers themselves. Let x be the other integer. Then we have:

GCD(350, x) = 11
LCM(350, x) = 7700

Multiplying these equations together, we get:

11 * 7700 = 350 * x

Solving for x, we find:

x = 350 * 11 / 7 = 550

Therefore, the other integer is 550, which is not among the answer choices. However, since the answer choices are all multiples of 11, we can check each one to see if it satisfies the given conditions. We find that only option (B) 308 works, since:

GCD(350, 308) = 11

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let dp[i] be the number of ways to reach the i-th step. Then we have:

dp[1] = 1 (one way to reach the first step)
dp[2] = 2 (one way to take two steps and one way to take one step)

For i > 2, we have:

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

This is because we can either take one step from the previous step (dp[i-1]) or two steps (dp[i-2]).

Using this recurrence relation, we can calculate dp[10] as follows:

dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3
dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 3 + 2 = 5
dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 5 + 3 = 8
dp[6] = dp[5] + dp[4] = 8 + 5 = 13
dp[7] = dp[6] + dp[5] = 13 + 8 = 21
dp[8] = dp[7] + dp[6] = 21 + 13 = 34
dp[9] = dp[8] + dp[7] = 34 + 21 = 55

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:


We need to find the value of 'k' for which the given quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant b^2 - 4ac must be greater than zero.

In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. Substituting these values in the discriminant formula, we get:

b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k > 0

Solving for 'k', we get:

k < 25/4

Therefore, the largest integral value of 'k' that satisfies this condition is 6. However, since we are looking for the largest integral value of 'k' that gives us two distinct real roots, we need to check if any of the answer choices satisfy this condition.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is

We can solve this problem using combinatorics. We need to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group and then choose 5 bottles out of the remaining 5 for the second group. 

The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 is given by the combination formula:

10! / (5! * 5!) = 252

So, the number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 for the first group is 252.

Once we have chosen the bottles for the first group, we are left with 5 bottles for the second group. The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 5 is simply 5! / (5! * 0!) = 1.

Therefore, the total number of ways to create the two groups is:

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We need to determine how many helpers are required to make the necessary number of cakes in the given time frame.
Let's start by calculating the total number of cakes that need to be made:
- Large cakes: 20
- Small cakes: 700

Since each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of helpers required:
(number of helpers * 2 large cakes/hour) + (number of helpers * 35 small cakes/hour) = total number of cakes needed
Simplifying this equation, we get:
(number of helpers * 37) = total number of cakes needed
Dividing both sides by 37, we get:
number of helpers = total number of cakes needed / 37
Plugging in the values we know, we get:
number of helpers = (20 large cakes + 700 small cakes) / 37
number of helpers = 720 cakes / 37
number of helpers = 19.4865 (rounded to two decimal places)
Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need at least 20 helpers to make all the cakes in the given time frame.
Therefore, the answer is (E) 19.

Question:I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:


The number you are thinking of is 23450.

Explanation:

Let's call the original 5-digit number "x". According to the problem statement, when we add a 1 after "x", the resulting number is three times larger than when we add a 1 before "x".

So we can set up two equations based on this information:

When we add a 1 after "x": x + 1 = 3(x - 1)
When we add a 1 before "x": 10x + 1 = 3(10x - 1)

Solving for x in each equation, we get:

x + 1 = 3(x - 1) => x = 2
10x + 1 = 3(10x - 1) => x = 2

Therefore, the original 5-digit number "x" must be equal to 2. To find the other digits, we can use either equation and solve for them:

Using the first equation: x + 1 = 3(x - 1) => 2 + 1 = 3(2 - 1) => 3 = 3
Using the second equation: 10x + 1 = 3(10x - 1) => 20 + 1 = 3(20 - 1) => 21 = 57

Since the second equation doesn't make sense (the result should be less than 20), we can conclude that the only possible solution is x = 2. Therefore, the original 5-digit number is 23450.

Question:A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can write an equation based on the given information: Let x be the tens digit and y be the units digit. Then, we have:

x + y = 10y - 18 (since the number is a two-digit number)
x = 9y - 18

Since y is a digit between 0 and 9, we know that y >= 1. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

x = 9(1) - 18 = -9

However, since x is a digit between 0 and 9, we know that x cannot be negative. Therefore, there is no solution for this problem.

Therefore, the answer is none of the above choices.

Question:64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use algebra to solve this problem. Let's call the total number of members in the group "x". We know that there are currently 64 boys and 40 girls in the group, so we can write:

64 + 40 = x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 104

Now, let's say that y boys and z girls joined the group during the membership drive. We also know that the ratio of boys to girls in the new group is 4:3, which means that:

y/z = 4/3

We can use this equation to find the values of y and z. One way to do this is to multiply both sides by z to get:

y = (4/3)z

Then, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for the total number of members in the group:

64 + 40 + y + z = x

Substituting y = (4/3)z, we get:

64 + 40 + (4/3)z + z = x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(5/3)z + 104 = x

Since we know that x = 104, we can substitute this value into the equation above to get:

(5/3)z + 104 = 104

Subtracting 104 from both sides, we get:

(5/3)z = 0

Dividing both sides by (5/3), we get:

z = 0

This means that no girls joined the group during the membership drive. Therefore, the total number of members in the group after the membership drive is:

64 + 40 + y = 104 + y

Since y represents the number of boys who joined the group, we can substitute this value into the equation above to get:

104 + y = x

Since we know that x = 104, we can substitute this value into the equation above to get:

104 + y = 104

Subtracting y from both sides, we get:

104 - y = 0

Therefore, y = 104.

So, the total number of members in the group after the membership drive is:

64 + 40 + 104 = 208

Therefore, the answer is (C).

Question:If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can calculate the number of eligible voters as follows:
Number of eligible voters = Total number of voters - Percentage of ineligible voters * Total number of voters
= 5000 - 20/100 * 5000
= 4000
The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, so the number of votes he received is:
Number of votes received by winning candidate = Number of eligible voters * Winning percentage
= 4000 * 15/100
= 600
Therefore, the total number of votes he got is:
Total number of votes = Number of votes received by winning candidate + Number of votes received by losing candidate
= 600 + Number of votes received by losing candidate
Since we don't know the number of votes received by the losing candidate, we cannot determine the exact value of the total number of votes. However, we can eliminate options that are clearly too high or too low.
Option (A) is too low because it is less than the number of eligible voters. Option (B) is also too low because it is less than option (A). Option (C) is too high because it is greater than the sum of options (A), (B), and (D). Option (D) is too low because it is less than option (C).
Therefore, the only remaining option is (E), which is closest to the possible range of values for the total number of votes. Therefore, the answer is (E).

Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can find the smallest possible value for the total number of students by minimizing each of the fractions that represent the number of students studying each subject. To do this, we can set each fraction equal to 1 and solve for the total number of students:

1/16 + 1/10 + 1/8 = x

Multiplying both sides by 80, we get:

5 + 8 + 10 = 80x

23 = 80x

x = 23/80

Since the total number of students must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest integer, which gives us a total of 3 students.

To find the largest possible value for the total number of students, we can maximize each of the fractions that represent the number of students studying each subject. To do this, we can set each fraction equal to 9 and solve for the total number of students:

9/16 + 9/10 + 9/8 = x

Multiplying both sides by 80, we get:

45 + 72 + 90 = 80x

207 = 80x

x = 207/80

Again, since the total number of students must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest integer, which gives us a total of 26 students.

The difference between the maximum and minimum values of the total number of students is:

26 - 3 = 23

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We need to find out how many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round. 

First, we need to convert five dozen toys into individual toys. Since a dozen has 12 toys, five dozens have 5 x 12 = 60 toys.

So, there are a total of 60 x 98 = 5880 toys in 98 boxes.

To find out how many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round, we need to divide the total number of toys by the number of toys that each tempo can carry.

Let's assume that each tempo can carry x toys. Then, we have:

29400 / x = number of tempos

We know that each tempo can carry at least 5880 toys, so we have:

29400 / 5880 = 5

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We need to count the number of ways to choose the first and third letters, which must be different consonants, and then multiply by the number of ways to choose the middle vowel and arrange the remaining 20 consonants.
There are 5 vowels and 20 consonants, so there are 5 choices for the first letter and 4 choices for the third letter (since we cannot use the same letter twice). This gives us a total of 5 * 4 = 20 possible combinations for the first and third letters.
For the middle letter, there are 5 vowels to choose from.
Finally, there are 20 consonants left and we need to arrange them in a row. There are 20!/(20-3)! ways to do this.
So the total number of possible codes is 20 * 5 * 20!/(20-3)!= 20*5*17!= 1,980,000.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. The total number of books on the shelf is 45, and we know that 30 of them are hardcover and 20 of them are fiction. 

To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to add the number of hardcover books to the number of fiction books, but then subtract the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction twice (since they were counted twice in the addition). 

So, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is:

30 + 20 - 2 * x = 50 - 2x

where x is the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

Since x must be a non-negative integer, the maximum value of x is 10 (when x=10, we have 30 hardcover books, 20 fiction books, and 10 books that are both hardcover and fiction).

Therefore, the answer is (A) 10.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use algebra to solve this problem. Let's call Sachin's current age "S" and Ajay's current age "A". According to the problem, we know that:

- 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay, so S - 10 = 2(A - 10)
- In 10 years, Sachin will be 40 years old, so S + 10 = 40

We can use these two equations to solve for S and A. First, we'll simplify the first equation:

S - 10 = 2(A - 10)
S - 10 = 2A - 20
S = 2A - 10

Now we can substitute this expression for S into the second equation:

S + 10 = 40
2A - 10 + 10 = 40
2A = 40
A = 20

Therefore, Ajay is currently 20 years old. The answer is (D).

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem using complementary counting. 

Let's assume that x students attended both the prom night and the debating session. Then, the number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session is:

200 - x

Since at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session, we know that:

0.45 * 200 <= x + (200 - x)
0.35 * 200 <= x + (200 - x)

Simplifying these inequalities, we get:

90 <= x
70 <= x

Therefore, x must be between 70 and 90, inclusive.

Now, let's find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. This would occur when all students attend either the prom night or the debating session, but not both. In this case, the number of students who attended either event is:

200 - x = 200 - 70 = 130

So, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:

200 - 130 = 70

0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40
Now we need to find the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver could have brought. Since each copper coin is worth less than each brass coin, the coin-diver would want to bring as few copper coins as possible while still being able to reach $3.40 in total value.
To do this, we can start by assuming that the coin-diver brought only brass coins. In this case, the number of brass coins would be equal to the total value divided by the value of each brass coin:
y = 3.40 / 0.25 = 13.6
Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, we know that the coin-diver must have brought at least 14 brass coins. However, if she had only brought 14 brass coins, her total value would be:
0.25 * 14 = 3.50
This is greater than $3.40, so we know that the coin-diver must have brought some copper coins as well.
Let's try bringing one fewer brass coin and one more copper coin. In this case, the number of brass coins would be 13 and the number of copper coins would be 14 - 1 = 13. The total value would be:
0.20 * 13 + 0.25 * 13 = 3.25
This is still less than $3.40, so we need to keep adding more copper coins until we reach the desired total value.
If we add two more copper coins, the number of brass coins would be 13 and the number of copper coins would be 13 + 2 = 15. The total value would be:
0.20 * 15 + 0.25 * 13 = 3.75
This is greater than $3.40, so we know that the coin-diver must have brought at least 15 copper coins.
Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver could have brought is 15, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

Question:Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can let the distance between X and Y be d. Then, we know that Allen's total distance traveled is 2d, since he goes from X to Y and then back to X again. Similarly, Bob's total distance traveled is also 2d, since he goes from Y to X and then back to Y again.
Now, we can use the fact that by the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. This means that Bob's speed of 78 kmph must have been faster than Allen's speed of 54 kmph for some amount of time t, such that:

78t - 54t = 48

Simplifying this equation, we get:

24t = 48

Dividing both sides by 24, we get:

t = 2

So, Bob was traveling at a speed of 78 kmph for 2 hours, while Allen was traveling at a speed of 54 kmph for the same amount of time. Therefore, during these 2 hours, Bob traveled a distance of:

78 kmph * 2 hours = 156 km

And Allen traveled a distance of:

54 kmph * 2 hours = 108 km

Since the distance between X and Y is d, we can set up the following equation based on the fact that Bob traveled 48 km more than Allen:

156 km + d = 108 km + d + 48 km

Simplifying this equation, we get:

d = 48 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 48 km.

We can set up a proportion to solve this problem:

w/25 gallons per x seconds = y gallons per t minutes

To convert gallons per x seconds to gallons per minute, we multiply by 60/x. So we have:

w/25 * 60/x = y/t

Simplifying and solving for t, we get:

t = 1500xy/w

Dividing both sides by 60, we get:

t/60 = 25xy/(4w)

Multiplying both sides by 4w, we get:

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula: distance = speed x time.
Let's call the distance traveled by the jeep during the forward journey "d".
During the forward journey, the speed of the jeep was d/6 km/hr.
During the return journey, the speed of the jeep was d/6 + 12 km/hr.
The total time taken for the round trip was 6 + 4 = 10 hours.
Using the formula, we can write:
d + d = (d/6) * 10 + (d/6 + 12) * 4
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2d = (5/3)d + 48
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
6d = 5d + 144
Subtracting 5d from both sides, we get:
d = 144
Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

Total work = 8 x 1 x 6 = 48 units

Now, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Let's call this number "x". Using the same formula, we get:

Total work = Work done per day per man x Number of men x Number of days

Substituting the new values, we get:

48 = x x 1 x 0.5

Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can find the angular speed of each ball by dividing the number of revolutions by the time taken for those revolutions. For ball A, this gives us:

Angular speed of A = 2 revolutions / 26 minutes = 0.077 revolutions per minute

For ball B, this gives us:

Angular speed of B = 5 revolutions / 35 minutes = 0.143 revolutions per minute

To find out how long it takes for them to be at the same starting point again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods of revolution. The period of revolution for ball A is 26 minutes, and the period of revolution for ball B is 35 minutes.

The LCM of 26 and 35 is 910, so it will take 910 minutes for both balls to complete an integer number of revolutions and return to their starting points.

Converting 910 minutes to hours and minutes, we get:

910 minutes = 15 hours and 10 minutes

We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48 to determine how often all three bells will ring together again.
The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.
The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5.
The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3.
To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720
So the bells will ring together again after every 720 seconds, which is equal to 12 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula: distance = rate * time.

For the first leg of the trip, Kevin traveled for t1 hours at a speed of 70 mph, so the distance he covered on this leg is d1 = 70t1.

For the second leg of the trip, Kevin traveled for t2 hours at a speed of 90 mph, so the distance he covered on this leg is d2 = 90t2.

Since Kevin's total travel time was 3 hours, we know that t1 + t2 = 3.

We also know that when Kevin was 70 miles away from B, he had traveled a total distance of d1 + d2 - 70.

Substituting the expressions for d1 and d2, we get:

70t1 + 90t2 - 70 = 70t1 + 90(3 - t1) - 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

20t1 = 140

t1 = 7

Therefore, t2 = 3 - t1 = 3 - 7 = -4, which is impossible since time cannot be negative.

This means that there must be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices. Therefore, the answer is (E) None of the above.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
Let's call the time it takes for the two cars to meet "t". Then we have:
distance = speed * time
For the first car, the distance traveled is 50 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So we have:
50 = 12 * t
Solving for t, we get:
t = 50 / 12 = 4.1667 hours
For the second car, the distance traveled is also 50 miles, and the speed is 13 mph. So we have:
50 = 13 * t
Solving for t, we get:
t = 50 / 13 = 3.8462 hours
Since the two cars are traveling in opposite directions, their speeds add up when they meet. Therefore, the total time it takes for them to meet is the sum of the times it takes each car to travel the full distance:
total time = t1 + t2 = 4.1667 + 3.8462 = 8.0129 hours
Converting this to minutes, we get:
total time = 8.0129 * 60 = 480.77 minutes

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula for the average speed of an object that travels along a circular path with radius r at constant angular velocity ω:

average speed = 2πrω

In this case, the plane is flying along the four sides of a square, which we can treat as a circle with diameter equal to the length of one side of the square. Let's call the length of one side of the square s.

The distance traveled by the plane along each side of the square is s, so the total distance traveled around the field is 4s.

The time it takes for the plane to fly around the field once is the same as the time it takes for the plane to complete one revolution around the circle, which is given by:

time = 2πr/ω

Substituting the values we have, we get:

time = 2π(s/2)/ω = πs/ω

Now we can substitute these expressions into the formula for the average speed:

average speed = 2πrω/πs/ω = 2r/s = 2(2s)/s = 4

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is 4 units per second, or 4 * 3600 = 14400 km/hour.

None of the answer choices match this value exactly, but the closest option is (E) 452 km/hour. Therefore, the answer is (E).

Question:Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula: total time = total work / rate. Let's assume that Alex made x toys and Jacob made y toys. Then we have:

x + y = 35 (total number of toys)
7x + 9y = total time (total time worked)

Since both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that their total time worked is equal. Therefore, we can set total time worked as some constant value t:

7x + 9y = t

Substituting x + y = 35 into this equation, we get:

7(35 - y) + 9y = t

Simplifying this equation, we get:

245 - 2y + 9y = t
7y = t - 245
y = (t - 245) / 7

Now we need to find the value of t that satisfies the condition that both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours. We can assume that they have worked for 30 days, so each day they have worked for approximately 8 hours. Therefore, their total time worked can be estimated as:

t = 30 * 8 = 240

Substituting this value of t into the equation for y, we get:

y = (240 - 245) / 7
y = -5 / 7

This result doesn't make sense since y represents the number of toys made by Jacob, which should be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust our assumption about the total time worked. Since they have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that their total time worked is slightly less than 240 hours. For example, we can assume that they have worked for 239 hours. Substituting this value of t into the equation for y, we get:

y = (239 - 245) / 7
y = -6 / 7

Again, this result doesn't make sense. We need to keep adjusting our assumption until we find a valid solution. After several iterations, we find that if we assume that they have worked for 238 hours, then we get:

y = (238 - 245) / 7
y = -7 / 7

This result also doesn't make sense. However, if we round down y to the nearest integer, we get:

y = -8

This result still doesn't make sense since y represents the number of toys made by Jacob, which should be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust our assumption again. After several more iterations, we find that if we assume that they have worked for 237 hours, then we get:

y = (237 - 245) / 7
y = -8 / 7

Rounding down y to the nearest integer, we get:

y = -1

This result still doesn't make sense since y represents the number of toys made by Jacob, which should be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust our assumption again. After several more iterations, we find that if we assume that they have worked for 236 hours, then we get:

y = (236 - 245) / 7
y = -9 / 7

Rounding down y to the nearest integer, we get:

y = -1

This result still doesn't make sense since y represents the number of toys made by Jacob, which should be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust our assumption again. After several more iterations, we find that if we assume that they have worked for 235 hours, then we get:

y = (235 - 245) / 7
y = -10 / 7

Rounding down y to the nearest integer, we get:

y = 0

This result makes sense since y represents the number of toys made by Jacob, which should be a non-negative integer. Therefore, we conclude that Jacob has made 0 toys.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 19.

When the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, we have:

h/d = tan(60) = sqrt(3)

So, h = sqrt(3)d.

Since h = d, we can substitute this into the second equation to get:

sqrt(3)d/d = sqrt(3)

So, d = sqrt(3).

Now we know that the distance from the car to the base of the tower is sqrt(3). We also know that the car is traveling at a uniform speed, so its velocity v is constant. Therefore, we can use the formula:

d = vt

to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. Substituting in d = sqrt(3), we get:

sqrt(3) = vt

Solving for t, we get:

t = sqrt(3)/v

Now we need to find out how much longer it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation changes from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. This means that the car has traveled a distance of sqrt(3) during this time interval. So, we can set up another equation:

sqrt(3) = vt'

where t' is the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation changes.

Substituting in t = sqrt(3)/v, we get:

sqrt(3) = v(sqrt(3)/v)

Simplifying, we get:

sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)

This tells us that the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation changes is equal to the original time it took for the car to travel sqrt(3) distance, which is:

t' = sqrt(3)/v

Substituting in v = sqrt(3)/t, we get:

t' = sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)/t)

Simplifying, we get:

t' = t

Therefore, the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation changes is equal to the original time it took for the car to travel sqrt(3) distance, which is:

t' = sqrt(3)/v = sqrt(3)/sqrt(3)/t = t

So, the answer is (E) None of these.

Question:Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem using algebra. Let's call the time it takes Mr. Sam to travel one way by car "x". Then we know that:

- The time it takes Mr. Sam to travel one way by train is x + 4.
- The total time it takes Mr. Sam to travel to the city and back by train is 2(x + 4).
- The total time it takes Mr. Sam to travel to the city and back by car is 2x.

We are told that the time it takes Mr. Sam to travel to the city and back by train is equal to the time it takes him to travel to the city and back by car plus 17 hours. So we can set up the equation:

2(x + 4) = 2x + 17

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 8 = 2x + 17

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

8 = 9

This equation is not true, which means there is no solution for x. Therefore, the answer choices are all incorrect. We cannot determine how long it would take Mr. Sam to travel to the city and back by car in both ways based on the information given.

Question:At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula distance = speed x time to solve this problem. 

First, we need to find the distance traveled by the space shuttle in 40 seconds. We know that it travels at a maximum speed of 700m/s, so:

distance = speed x time
distance = 700m/s x 40s
distance = 28,000m

Next, we need to find the distance traveled by the space shuttle in 5 seconds. Since we know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, we can assume that the space shuttle covers the entire length of itself in this time. Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is equal to the distance traveled in 5 seconds:

length = distance / time
length = 28,000m / 5s
length = 5600m

Therefore, the answer is not among the choices given. The correct answer is not listed.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can calculate the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade using the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.
Since the fan blade is 10 centimeters from the center of the fan and makes 300 revolutions in 30 seconds, its angular velocity is:
ω = 2π × 300/60 = 30π radians/s
The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 30 seconds is given by:
d = ωt × r = 30π × 30 × 10 = 9000π cm
Therefore, the answer is (E) 7500π.

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula for the average wage over a period of time: total wage / number of days = average wage.
Let's call the wage on the 8th day "w". Then we know that:
(15 * $90) / 15 = $90 (average wage over the entire fortnight)
(7 * $87 + w + 7 * $92) / 15 = $90 (average wage over the entire fortnight)
Simplifying these equations, we get:
$90 = $90 (true by definition)
$90 = (7 * $87 + w + 7 * $92) / 15
Multiplying both sides by 15, we get:
$1350 = 7 * $87 + w + 7 * $92
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$1350 = 609 + w + 644
Subtracting 609 and 644 from both sides, we get:
w = $97

Then it will take an additional 18 minutes for machine A to produce its third yo-yo and another 18 minutes for machine B to produce its fourth yo-yo. At this point, both machines have produced 6 yo-yos each. It will take machine A 6 more minutes to produce its seventh yo-yo and machine B 3 more minutes to produce its eighth yo-yo, at which point they will have produced 10 yo-yos in total.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula: distance = speed x time. Let's call the distance between A and B "d". 

For Ram, the distance he travels in 10 seconds is 20 m/s x 10 s = 200 m. Since he meets Krishna at point C, we know that the distance he traveled plus the distance Krishna traveled must equal d. Therefore, the distance Krishna traveled in 10 seconds is d - 200 m.

Now let's consider Krishna's speed. He travels at a speed of 40 m/s, so the distance he travels in 10 seconds is 40 m/s x 10 s = 400 m. We already know that this is equal to d - 200 m, so we can set up an equation:

400 m = d - 200 m

Solving for d, we get:

d = 600 m

Therefore, the total distance between A and B is 600 meters, which is answer choice (E).

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem using the concept of rates of work. 

Mr. Brown can paint one house in 6 days, so his rate of work is 1/6 houses per day. 

Mr. Black can paint one house in 8 days, so his rate of work is 1/8 houses per day. 

Mr. Blue can paint one house in 12 days, so his rate of work is 1/12 houses per day. 

After 8 days, Mr. Brown has painted 8/6 = 4/3 houses. 

Mr. Black has worked for 6 days, so he has painted 6/8 = 3/4 houses. 

Together, they have painted 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 houses. 

Since they are painting three houses, there are still 3 - 25/12 = 11/12 houses left to be painted. 

Mr. Blue's rate of work is 1/12 houses per day, so it will take him 11/12 / (1/12) = 11 days to finish the remaining houses. 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 11.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We need to find the area of the field and divide it by the area that the cow can graze in one day.
The area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a circle, which is pi times the radius squared. Since the cow is tied in the middle of the field, we can assume that the radius of the field is half of the length of the rope, which is 7 feet. Therefore, the area of the field is pi times 7 squared, or about 153 square feet.
Since the cow can graze 10 square feet per day, it will take the cow about 15.3 days to graze the whole field. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get an answer of 16 days. However, this answer choice is not among the options given. The closest option is (A) 51 days, so we choose that as our answer.

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula: distance = rate * time. Let's assume that the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is d.
For train A, the time taken to travel this distance is t1 = d / 40.
For train B, the time taken to travel this distance is t2 = d / 72.
Since both trains are traveling in the same direction, we can add their times to find when they will meet:
t1 + t2 = d / 40 + d / 72
Multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 40 and 72 (which is 1440), we get:
36d + 20d = 1440d
Simplifying, we get:
56d = 1440d
Dividing both sides by 56d, we get:
t1 + t2 = 25.71 hours
Since both trains leave at different times, we need to convert this to hours and minutes. We know that there are 24 hours in a day, so the total time from 11 am to midnight is 11 hours. Therefore, the meeting time will be:
11 am + 14 hours and 49 minutes = 3:49 pm on the next day
Therefore, the answer is (C) 5 pm on the next day.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can set up an equation to solve this problem. Let x be the number of sales made by the salesperson. The salesperson's commission for each sale is 10%, so their total commission earned is 0.1x. We know that their salary must be at least $1000, and their commission is the only source of income mentioned, so we can say that:

0.1x >= $1000

To find out how many sales the salesperson must make to earn at least $1000, we need to solve for x:

x >= $1000 / 0.1
x >= $10,000

So the salesperson must make at least 10 sales to earn a commission of $10,000 or more. However, since the sales are of $250 each, the salesperson must make at least:

10 * $250 = $2500

Therefore, the salesperson must make at least 10 sales to earn a commission of $1000 or more.

Question:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the following equation to solve this problem:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Let's assume that the cost price per pen is x.
Then, the selling price per pen would be 1.25x (since the overall profit is 25%).
The company needs to produce and sell 7200 pens to make a profit. However, 10% of the pens will be defective and rejected, so only 90% or 6480 pens will actually be sold.
Therefore, the total revenue from selling the pens would be 6480 * 10 = Rs. 64800.
Substituting this into the profit equation, we get:
1.25x * 6480 = 64800
Solving for x, we get:
x = 8
Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 8.
So the answer is (D).

Question:The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem with algebra. Let x be the weight of the new man. The sum of the weights of the original 10 men is 10 * 53 = 530 kg. The sum of the weights of the 10 men and the new man is 10 * 53 + x = 530 + x. Since the average weight increases by 1.8 kg, we know that (530 + x) / 11 = 53 + 1.8. Multiplying both sides by 11 gives us 530 + x = 591 + 19.8. Subtracting 530 from both sides gives us x = 61.8. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get x = 62.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.

Let's start by finding the percentage of employees who take either a winter or a summer vacation:

- 75% take a winter vacation
- 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation
- So, 75% - 40% = 35% take only a winter vacation

Now let's find the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation:

- We know that 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation
- So, 100% - 20% = 80% take at least one type of vacation
- We also know that 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation
- So, 80% - 40% = 40% take only a summer vacation

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:

- 40% - 35% = 5%

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can set up an equation based on the problem statement:

Let x be the amount of mixture that needs to be removed.
The amount of sand in the original mixture is 0.3 * 10 = 3 kg.
The amount of clay in the original mixture is 0.7 * 10 = 7 kg.
After removing x kg of the mixture, the amount of sand will be 3 - 0.3x kg, and the amount of clay will be 7 - 0.7x kg.
Since we want the final mixture to have equal amounts of sand and clay, we can set up the following equation:
3 - 0.3x = 7 - 0.7x

Solving for x, we get:
0.4x = 4
x = 10

Therefore, 10 kg of the mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand.

Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula for the weighted average:

average = (sum of weights * sum of values) / (sum of weights)

Let's call the weight of the heavy duty truck "x". Then we know that:

12.2 = (10 * sum of the weights of the other vehicles) / (10 + 1)
12.2 * (10 + 1) = 10 * sum of the weights of the other vehicles + x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

122.2 = 100 + 10x
22.2 = 10x
x = 2.22

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is approximately 2.22 tons. However, since the answer choices are all whole numbers, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us an answer of 3.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 44.8.

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can set up a system of equations to solve this problem.
Let x be the amount of zinc in alloy X and y be the amount of zinc in alloy Y.
Then we have:
x/15 = 6/15 (since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9)
y/16 = 7/18 (since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11)

Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 24 grams
y = 28 grams

Now let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture:
Total zinc = x + y = 24 + 28 = 52 grams
Total copper = (40 - x) + (60 - y) = 16 + 32 = 48 grams

So the ratio of zinc to copper in the mixture is:

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula for average cost when some items are dropped:

Average cost after dropping = Total cost / Number of remaining items

Let's assume that the original contribution of each man was x. Then, the total cost before any drops was MD.

After three men drop out, there are M - 3 men left, and the total cost becomes (MD - 3x).

So, the average cost after dropping is:

(MD - 3x) / (M - 3)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

MD / M - 3x / (M - 3)

Since each man has to contribute more towards the purchase of the gift, we want to find the difference between the original average cost (x) and the new average cost after dropping:

New average cost - Original average cost = (MD / M - 3x / (M - 3)) - x

Multiplying both sides by M(M - 3), we get:

MD(M - 3) - 3xM = MD(M - 3) - Mx(M - 3)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

3xM = MD

Therefore, each man has to contribute 3x towards the purchase of the gift after three men drop out. Substituting x = MD / M into this expression, we get:

3(D/M) = MD

Simplifying this expression, we get:

3D = MD

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) MD/3.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula:

Proportion of tagged deer = Number of tagged deer / Total number of deer

Let's call the total number of deer in the forest "x". Then we have:

Proportion of tagged deer = 300 / x (from 2001)
Proportion of tagged deer = 20 / 500 (from 2002)

Since the proportion of tagged deer is assumed to be the same for both years, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

300 / x = 20 / 500

Multiplying both sides by 500x, we get:

150000 = 20x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem using algebra. Let's assume that Mark has x amount of money and John has y amount of money.
According to the first statement, if John gives Mark half his money, Mark will have a total of x + 0.5y = 75.
According to the second statement, if Mark gives John one-third of his money, John will have a total of y + 0.3x = 75.
Now we have two equations with two variables:
x + 0.5y = 75
y + 0.3x = 75
We can solve these equations simultaneously by multiplying the first equation by 0.3 and subtracting it from the second equation:
0.3x + 0.15y - y - 0.3x = 0
-0.85y = 0
y = 0
This means that John had no money at all. Therefore, the answer is (E) 18.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
Let's start by finding the total number of chocolates in the store. We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so the remaining 90% must be vanilla flavored. Therefore, there are 90/100 * x chocolates in the store, where x is the total number of chocolates.
Next, we need to find the number of vanilla-flavored chocolates that are not squashed. We know that 90% of the vanilla-flavored chocolates are not squashed, so there are 0.9 * (90/100 * x) = 0.81x vanilla-flavored chocolates that are not squashed.
Finally, we can find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed by dividing the number of such chocolates by the total number of chocolates and multiplying by 100%. This gives us:
(0.81x / x) * 100% = 81%

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let x be the number of trousers purchased.
The total cost of trousers is 810, so we have:
70x = 810
Solving for x, we get:
x = 11.57
Since the number of trousers must be a whole number, we round down to 11.
Now we need to find the maximum number of shirts that can be purchased with the remaining money. The total cost of shirts is:
30y = 810 - 70x
Substituting x=11, we get:
30y = 810 - 70(11)
30y = 240
y = 8
So the maximum number of shirts that can be purchased is 8.
Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is:

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the fact that the median income is the middle value in the list of incomes. Since the total income is $9000 and the median income is $3000, we know that at least half of the incomes are less than or equal to $3000, and at least half are greater than or equal to $3000.
If there were only two members in the family, then both incomes would have to be exactly $3000, which means the total income would be $6000, not $9000. So, option (A) is incorrect.
If there were three members in the family, then one income could be $3000 and the other two could be either both above or both below $3000. In the first case, the total income would be more than $9000, and in the second case, it would be less than $9000. So, option (B) is also incorrect.
If there were four members in the family, then two incomes could be $3000 and the other two could be either both above or both below $3000. In the first case, the total income would be more than $9000, and in the second case, it would be less than $9000. So, option (C) is also incorrect.
If there were five members in the family, then three incomes could be $3000 and the other two could be either both above or both below $3000. In the first case, the total income would be more than $9000, and in the second case, it would be less than $9000. So, option (D) is also incorrect.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem using algebra. Let's call the current population "P". According to the problem, the population will increase by 10% each year for the next two years, so after one year, the population will be P + 0.1P = 1.1P. After two years, the population will be 1.1P + 0.1(1.1P) = 1.21P.
The problem states that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago, so we can set up the equation 1.21P = 2P - P. Solving for P, we get P = 2.21P / 1.21 = 2P. This means that the population has increased by 100% over the last year.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:


Let's call the original number "x". According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from x, the result is one-third of x:

x - 30 = (1/3)x

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:

3(x - 30) = x

Expanding the left side and simplifying gives:

3x - 90 = x

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

2x = 90

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 45

So the original number is 45. To find the value of 50% of this number, we can multiply 45 by 0.5:

50% of 45 = 0.5 * 45 = 22.5

Therefore, the answer is (A) 22.5.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is

We can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.
In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8%, n = 2 (since the interest is compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We want to find P, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for P:
P = A / ((1 + r/n)^(nt)) = $54,080 / ((1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)) = $50,000
Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is $50,000, which is option (B).

where % means "percent". To find m% in terms of x and y, we can rearrange this equation as follows:

m% = x / (4y)

To convert m% to a percentage, we need to multiply it by 100:

m = m% * 100 = x / (4y) * 100 = 25x / y

Therefore, m is 25 times x divided by y, or 2500% of x. The correct answer is (D).

We can use the formula for simple interest: I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount borrowed, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.
In this case, we know that P = Rs. 5000, I = Rs. 300, and T = 3 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
300 = 5000 * R * 3
Solving for R, we get:
R = 300 / (5000 * 3)
R = 0.02
Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%. The answer is (A).

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can let $x$ represent the number of grams of health food that must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins. Then we have \begin{align*}
9\% x &= 0.09x \text{ represents the amount of vitamin E}\\
8\% x &= 0.08x \text{ represents the amount of vitamin A}.
\end{align*} In order to get the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins, $0.09x + 0.08x = 0.17x$ must be greater than or equal to the sum of the minimum daily requirements of vitamin E and vitamin A, which is $0.09 + 0.08 = 0.17$. Solving this inequality, we find that $x \geq 1$. The only answer choice which satisfies this condition is $\boxed{10.5}$.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula for simple interest: S.I. = P * R * T / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.
For compound interest, we have the formula: CI = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P.
Given that the difference between simple interest and compound interest for Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72, we can set up the equation:
CI - S.I. = 72
Substituting the formulas for CI and S.I., we get:
P * (1 + R/100)^T - P * R * T / 100 = 72
Simplifying this equation, we get:
R * T * (100 - R) / 10000 = 72
Multiplying both sides by 10000, we get:
R^2 - 100R + 72000 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we can solve for R:
R = [100 ± sqrt(100^2 - 4*72000)] / 2
R = [100 ± sqrt(10000 - 288000)] / 2
R = [100 ± sqrt(-278000)] / 2
Since the square root of a negative number is not real, there is no solution for R using the quadratic formula. Therefore, none of the given answer choices are correct.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can set up an equation based on the information given:

Length of fence = width of picket + space between pickets * number of pickets

Substituting the values given, we get:

Length of fence = 1/2 inch + 6 inches * x

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Length of fence = 1/2 inch + 6x inches

To convert this to feet, we need to divide by 12:

Length of fence = (1/2 inch + 6x inches) / 12

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Length of fence = (1/24) inch + (1/2) foot * x

Since we want the length of the fence in feet, we can drop the fraction of an inch and write:

Length of fence = (1/24) foot + x feet

Multiplying both sides by 24, we get:

Length of fence * 24 = 1 foot + 24x feet

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Length of fence * 24 = 25x feet

Dividing both sides by 25, we get:

Length of fence = (25x)/24 feet

Therefore, the answer is (D).

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can solve this problem by using the concept of proportional reasoning. If the length of the ribbon was reduced in the ratio 5:3, then it means that for every 5 units of length that were removed, 3 units of length remained.
To find the new length of the ribbon, we need to determine how many units of length were removed and how many units of length remain. We can do this by setting up a proportion:
5/8 = x/30
where x represents the number of units of length that were removed.
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:
5 * 30 = 8 * x
150 = 8x
x = 18.75
This means that 18.75 units of length were removed from the original 30 cm length of the ribbon. To find the new length of the ribbon, we subtract this amount from the original length:
30 - 18.75 = 11.25
Therefore, the new length of the ribbon is 11.25 cm, which is closest to option (E) 12. So the answer is (E).

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3.
Since the rope is 20 meters long, we know that:
x + (x - 3) = 20
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x - 3 = 20
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
2x = 23
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 11.5
Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can calculate this by first finding the total number of small cubes in the large cube and then subtracting the number of cubes that are covered by the paint on the outside.

The large cube has sides of length 5 cm, so it contains $5^3 = 125$ small cubes. The thickness of the large cube is 1 cm, so there are 4 layers of small cubes in each direction. This means that there are a total of $4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64$ small cubes in each layer.

Since the paint covers the outside of the large cube, it covers all of the small cubes that are visible from any face of the large cube. There are 6 faces on a cube, so the paint covers a total of $6 \times 64 = 384$ small cubes.

Therefore, the number of small cubes that remain unpainted is $125 - 384 = -259$. However, since we cannot have a negative number of cubes, the answer must be 0. None of the answer choices match this value, so none of them are correct.

Question:When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
Let's call the length of the sheet "l" and the width "w". When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, we get two rectangles with dimensions l/2 and w. The perimeter of these two rectangles is 48 cm, so we have:
P = 2(l/2 + w)
48 = l + 2w
Similarly, when the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, we get two rectangles with dimensions l and w/2. The perimeter of these two rectangles is 66 cm, so we have:
P = 2(l + w/2)
66 = l + w
Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve them simultaneously by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:
66 - 2(48) = w - 2w
-18 = -w
w = 18
Substituting this value of w into either of the original equations gives us:
48 = l + 2(18)
48 = l + 36
l = 12
So the length of the sheet is 12 cm and the width is 18 cm. The area of the sheet is therefore:
A = l * w
A = 12 * 18
A = 216
Therefore, the answer is not among the choices given.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the fact that the midpoint of a line segment divides it into two equal parts to find the length ofRU.

SinceUis the midpoint ofST, the length ofSU is half the length ofST, which is 11.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length ofRU:

RU^2 = RS^2 + SU^2

RU^2 = 5^2 + 11^2

RU^2 = 25 + 121

RU^2 = 146

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

RU = √146 ≈ 12.08

Therefore, the length of line segmentRU is approximately 12.08 units. However, since this is not one of the answer choices, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us an answer of 13.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
Let's call the breadth "b" and the length "l". We can set up two equations based on the given information:

l = 4b + 1 (length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth)
Area = l * b = 150 (area is 150 square meters)

We can solve for "b" in terms of "l" using the first equation:

b = (l - 1) / 4

Substituting this expression for "b" into the second equation, we get:

l * ((l - 1) / 4) = 150

Multiplying both sides by 4 to clear the fraction, we get:

l^2 - l - 600 = 0

This is a quadratic equation that we can solve using the quadratic formula:

l = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

where a = 1, b = -1, and c = -600.

Plugging in these values, we get:

l = (1 ± sqrt(1^2 - 4*1*(-600))) / 2*1
= (1 ± sqrt(2401)) / 2
= (1 ± 49) / 2
= 25 or -24

Since the length cannot be negative, we reject the solution -24 and conclude that the length is 25 meters. Substituting this value back into either of the original equations, we can find the breadth:

b = (25 - 1) / 4
= 6

Finally, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to find the answer:

Perimeter = 2(l + b)
= 2(25 + 6)
= 62

Therefore, the answer is (C) 62 m.

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width. We know that one side of the rectangle is unpainted, so we can write:

P = 2L + 2W + U

where U is the length of the unpainted side. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write:

2L + 2W = 37

Simplifying this equation, we get:

L + W = 18.5

Now we can substitute this expression into our first equation:

P = 2L + 2W + U
P = 2(L + W) + U
P = 2(18.5) + U
P = 37 + U

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we can substitute this value into our equation:

P = 37 + 9
P = 46

Therefore, the perimeter of the parking space is 46 feet. To find the area of the parking space, we need to divide the perimeter by 2 and subtract the length of the unpainted side:

Area = (Perimeter - U) / 2
Area = (46 - 9) / 2
Area = 37 / 2
Area = 18.5

So the area of the parking space is 18.5 square feet. However, since the area must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 19 square feet. Therefore, the answer is not among the choices given. The correct answer is (E) None.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We know that the volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, and the volume of a cube with side length $s$ is $s^3$. Since a sphere can fit in a cube, we must have $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \leq s^3$, or $\frac{\pi r^3}{s^3} \leq \frac{3}{4}$. Taking the cube root of both sides gives $\frac{r}{s} \leq \sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{3}}{2}$.
Since the sphere fits in the cube, the side length of the cube must be at least twice the radius of the sphere. Therefore, we have $s \geq 2r$, or $\frac{r}{s} \leq \frac{1}{2}$. Combining this with the previous inequality, we get $\frac{r}{s} \leq \frac{\sqrt[3]{3}}{2} \leq \frac{1}{2}$.
Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is at most $\frac{s^3}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3} = \frac{27}{4\pi}$. Among the answer choices, only option (A) has a ratio less than or equal to $\frac{27}{4\pi}$, so the answer is (A).
