Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can write 2272 as $N \cdot q_1 + r_1$ and 875 as $N \cdot q_2 + r_2$, where $q_1,q_2,r_1,$ and $r_2$ are positive integers and $r_1 = r_2$. Then $2272 - 875 = N \cdot (q_1 - q_2)$. Since $2272 - 875 = 1397 = 11 \cdot 127$, we see that $q_1 - q_2 = 127$. Then $q_1 = 127 + q_2$ for some non-negative integer $q_2$. Substituting this into our first two equations, we have \begin{align*}
2272 &= N \cdot q_1 + r_1 \\
&= N \cdot (127 + q_2) + r_1 \\
875 &= N \cdot q_2 + r_2.
\end{align*} Subtracting these two equations, we obtain $N \cdot q_1 - N \cdot q_2 = 2272 - 875 = 1397$, so $N(q_1 - q_2) = 1397$. But since $q_1 - q_2 = 127$, we have $N = \frac{1397}{127} = 11$. The sum of the digits of $N$ is $\boxed{11}$.
Therefore, the answer is

(B).

Question:What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We need to make as many identical bouquets as possible with the given flowers. Since each bouquet must have an equal number of red and white tulips, we can start by dividing the total number of tulips into groups of equal size.
The largest group size would be the GCD (greatest common divisor) of 28 and 98, which is 14. So we can divide both the white and red tulips into groups of 14.
For the white tulips, we can make 2 groups of 14, leaving 4 tulips unused. For the red tulips, we can make 7 groups of 14, leaving 0 tulips unused.
Therefore, the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be made is 7, using all the red tulips and 2 groups of white tulips. The answer is (B).
Therefore, the answer is

(B).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can write the equation as $M-N=396(c-15)$, so we need to find all solutions for $c$ such that $M-N>0$. Since $M>N$, we have $a>c$. We also know that $M$ and $N$ are both three-digit numbers, so $100\leq a,c\leq 9$. Therefore, $c$ can be any value from $10$ to $8$, inclusive. For each value of $c$, there are two possible values of $a$ (since $a>c$), and one possible value of $b$ (since $M$ and $N$ are distinct). So the total number of possible values of $M$ is $2\times 8\times 1=16$. However, we need to subtract the cases where $M<300$. If $a=1$, then $M<300$ regardless of the values of $b$ and $c$. If $a=2$, then $M<300$ only when $b=1$ and $c=10$. Therefore, there are $2+1=3$ cases where $M<300$. Hence, the number of values of $M$ that are more than 300 is $16-3=13$. The answer is (E).

Question:The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let the digits be $a$, $b$ and $c$. We have that: \begin{align*}
a+b+c &= 17 \\
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 &= 109 \\
100a+10b+c - 495 &= 100c + 10b+a
\end{align*}From this, we can see that $(a-b)(a-c) = 0$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all nonnegative integers, it follows that at least one of $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be zero; without loss of generality, let $b=0$. Then $c = 17-a$, and we plug these values into the last equation to get: \begin{align*}
100a + 10(0) + a - 495 &= 100(17-a) + 10(0) + 17-a \\
101a &= 2222 \\
a &= 22.
\end{align*}Then, $c = 17-a = 5$ and $b = 0$, so our number is $\boxed{225}$.
Therefore, the answer is

Question:If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
Answer: Let's think step by step.


To solve this problem, we need to recall some basic facts about prime factorization and the number of factors of an integer.

1. Every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers in a unique way, up to rearrangement of the factors.
2. The number of factors of a positive integer n is equal to (p+1)(q+1), where p and q are the exponents of the two distinct prime factors of n.

Using these facts, we can see that if Q has 5 factors, then it must have exactly two distinct prime factors, say p and q, with exponents 1 and 4 respectively. This means that Q can be written as:

Q = p^1 * q^4

Now, let's consider each of the options given:

A) Q is divisible by 30: Since Q has only two distinct prime factors, it cannot be divisible by 30, which has at least three distinct prime factors (2, 3, and 5). Therefore, option A is false.

B) Q is a perfect square: If Q were a perfect square, then both p and q would have to be even, since the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of a perfect square must be even. But this would mean that Q has more than five factors, since there would be additional factors of 2 raised to higher powers. Therefore, option B is false.

C) Q is a multiple of 6: Since Q has only two distinct prime factors, it cannot be divisible by 6, which has at least three distinct prime factors (2, 3). Therefore, option C is false.

D) Q is a multiple of 8: Since Q has only two distinct prime factors, it cannot be divisible by 8, which has at least three distinct prime factors (2, 2, and 2). Therefore, option D is false.

E) Q is a multiple of 10: Since Q has only two distinct prime factors, it cannot be divisible by 10, which has at least three distinct prime factors (2, 5). Therefore, option E is false.

Therefore, none of the options given must be true about Q.

Question:Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let x = Joe's age, y = Joe's sister's age, z = Joe's father's age.
From the given conditions, we can form the following equations:
x + y + z = 100
y = 2 * x (when Joe is as old as his father)
z = 2 * y (when Joe is as old as his father)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
x + 2x + 2(2x) = 100
7x = 100
x = 14.29

Since Joe's age cannot be a fraction, we need to check if any of the other options satisfy the given conditions.

Option (A): If Joe's father's age is 45, then Joe's sister's age would be 2 * 14.29 = 28.58, which is not an integer. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.

Option (B): If Joe's father's age is 48, then Joe's sister's age would be 2 * 14.29 = 28.58, which is not an integer. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.

Option (C): If Joe's father's age is 50, then Joe's sister's age would be 2 * 14.29 = 28.58, which is not an integer. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.

Option (D): If Joe's father's age is 55, then Joe's sister's age would be 2 * 14.29 = 28.58, which is not an integer. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect.

Option (E): If Joe's father's age is 58, then Joe's sister's age would be 2 * 14.29 = 28.58, which is not an integer. Therefore, option (E) is incorrect.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let x be the number of large cake helpers. Then, (3*20)/x = 60/x cakes can be made in 3 hours by a large cake helper. Similarly, let y be the number of small cake helpers. Then, (3*700)/y = 2100/y cakes can be made in 3 hours by a small cake helper. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:

60/x + 2100/y = 20 (large cakes)
3*x + 4*y = 60 (total helpers)

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

3*x + 4*(20 - 60/x) = 60

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

x = 10

Substituting x = 10 into the first equation, we get:

60/10 + 2100/y = 20

Simplifying and solving for y, we get:

y = 15

Therefore, the total number of helpers required is x + y = 10 + 15 = 25.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let $x$ be the larger of the two numbers. Then the smaller number is $3/5x$. After 9 is subtracted from each, the two numbers are $(x-9)$ and $\left(\frac{3}{5}x - 9\right)$. In this case, the ratio between them is still $3:5$, so we can set up the equation \begin{align*}
\frac{x-9}{\frac{3}{5}x - 9}&=\frac{3}{5}\\
5(x-9)&=3\left(\frac{3}{5}x - 9\right)\\
5x - 45 &= \frac{9}{5}x - 27\\
\frac{16}{5}x&=18\\
x&=\boxed{\frac{45}{4}}.

Question:I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let's call the five-digit number "x". According to the problem, when we add a 1 after x, the resulting number is three times larger than when we add a 1 before x.

So we can write an equation:

3(x + 1) = 10x + 1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3x + 3 = 10x + 1

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

3 = 7x + 1

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

2 = 7x

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

x = 2/7

However, since x is a five-digit number, we need to round up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the only possible value for x is 3.

So the five-digit number that satisfies the given property is 3.

Number of votes the loser got = (x - 15)/100 * 4000 = 3600 - 15x/100
Since the winner got 1 more vote than the loser, we get x = (3600 + 15x/100)/2
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 3600 = 375x/100

Question:In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The total number of students must be divisible by 16, 10, and 8, which means it must be a multiple of their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80, so the total number of students must be a multiple of 80.
Let's try some multiples of 80 that are also 4-digit numbers. The smallest such number is 8000, but this doesn't work because then there would be no room for the other subjects. The next largest multiple of 80 that is also a 4-digit number is 8800.
If we have 8800 students in the class, then 1/16 of them study math, which means 550 students study math. Similarly, 880 students study bio and 1100 students study English.
To find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students, we need to find the maximum possible number of students who could study each subject. If all 8800 students studied math, then the maximum number of students studying math would be 8800. If all 8800 students studied bio, then the maximum number of students studying bio would be 8800. And if all 8800 students studied English, then the maximum number of students studying English would be 8800.
So the maximum possible number of students studying any one subject is 8800. To find the minimum possible number of students studying any one subject, we can subtract the number of students studying the other two subjects from the total number of students. In this case, the minimum possible number of students studying math would be 8800 - 880 - 1100 = 6820.
Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 8800 - 6820 = 1980. This is not one of the answer choices given. However, we can see that the closest answer choice is (A) 8880, which is only 10 more than the actual difference. Therefore, the answer is (A) 8880.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(A) 8880.

Question:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can find the probability by counting the number of relatively prime numbers in S and dividing by the total number of numbers in S. The prime factorization of 1,000 is $2^3 \cdot 5^3$. A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not contain any factors of 2 or 5. There are $500$ multiples of 2 between 1 and 1,000, $300$ multiples of 5 between 1 and 1,000, and $100$ multiples of both 2 and 5 between 1 and 1,000. Thus, there are $500 + 300 - 100 = 700$ numbers that are not relatively prime to 1,000. So, there are $1000 - 700 = 300$ relatively prime numbers. The probability that a randomly selected number is relatively prime to 1,000 is $\frac{300}{1000} = \boxed{\frac{3}{10}}$.

3/10.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that the units digit of an odd number is either 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9. We also know that the sum of any 5 consecutive odd numbers will always be divisible by 10. This means that the units digit of their sum must be 0. Since the units digit of each odd number in the sequence is either 1 or 9, the units digit of their sum must be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. Therefore, the tens digit of the sum must be 2. The only option that has a tens digit of 2 and a units digit of 1 is 41.

How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
Answer: Let's think step by step.
There are 5 vowels and 20 consonants, so we have a total of 25 letters to choose from.
We need to choose 3 letters, where the middle letter is a vowel and the first and third letters are consonants.
The number of ways to choose the first letter is 20 (since it cannot be a vowel), and the number of ways to choose the third letter is also 20 (since it cannot be the same as the first letter or a vowel).
Once we have chosen the first and third letters, there are only 4 vowels left to choose from for the middle letter.
So the total number of possible codes is:
20 * 20 * 4 = 1600
Therefore, the answer is not among the options given.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
None of the above. The correct answer is not among the options given. The calculation for the total number of possible codes is incorrect. The correct calculation would be:
Number of ways to choose the first letter: 20 (consonants)
Number of ways to choose the second letter: 5 (vowels)
Number of ways to choose the third letter: 19 (remaining consonants)
Total number of possible codes = 20 * 5 * 19 = 1900

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can solve this problem with some basic set theory. The intersection of two sets contains the elements that are in both sets. So, if we want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to find the intersection of the set of hardcover books and the set of fiction books.
To do this, we can use the formula for the size of the intersection of two sets:
|A ∩ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∪ B|
where |A| represents the size of set A, and |A ∪ B| represents the size of the union of sets A and B.
In this case, we know that |A| = 30 (the number of hardcover books), |B| = 20 (the number of fiction books), and |A ∪ B| = 45 (the total number of books on the shelf). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
|A ∩ B| = 30 + 20 - 45 = 5
So the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 5. Therefore, the answer is (A) 10.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let C be the number of copper coins and B be the number of brass coins. We have the following system of equations:

20C + 25B = 340

We want to minimize C, so we need to find the smallest possible value of B that satisfies this equation.

Dividing both sides by 5 gives:

4C + 5B = 68

Now we can try different values of B until we find one that works. If B = 0, then 4C = 68, which means C = 17. But since there are only 100 cents in a dollar, C cannot be greater than 10. So we try B = 1:

4C + 5(1) = 68

4C = 63

C = 15.75

Since C must be an integer, we round up to get C = 16. This means the coin-diver brought at least 16 copper coins.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 0.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. If Jill needs 10 bottles of soda for 8 people, then we can write:

10/8 = x/y

where x is the number of bottles of soda Jill needs for 12 people and y is the number of people at the second party.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

10y = 8x

Then we can divide both sides by 8:

y/8 = x/10

Now we can substitute the value of y from the given information:

12/8 = x/10

Simplifying the left side gives:

3/2 = x/10

Multiplying both sides by 10 gives:

15 = x

Therefore, Jill will need to buy 15 bottles of soda for a party in which 12 people are attending. The answer is not among the choices provided, so we cannot select any of them.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let the distance between X and Y be d. When they meet for the first time, they have traveled a combined distance of 2d. Since Bob travels faster, he will cover this distance in less time than Allen. Therefore, when they meet for the first time, Bob will have covered more distance than Allen.
When they meet for the second time, they have traveled a combined distance of 4d. Since Bob still travels faster, he will cover this distance in less time than Allen. Therefore, when they meet for the second time, Bob will have covered more distance than Allen again.
We are told that by the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. This means that the total distance that Bob has traveled is 2d + 48 km, while the total distance that Allen has traveled is 2d.
Since Bob travels at 78 kmph and Allen travels at 54 kmph, we can set up the equation:
(2d + 48) / 78 = 2d / 54
Solving for d gives us:
d = 144 km

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let the original speed of the jeep be x km/hr. Then, during the return journey, its speed was (x + 12) km/hr. 

We can use the formula: distance = speed × time

For the forward journey:
distance = x × 6

For the return journey:
distance = (x + 12) × 4

Since the total distance covered in both journeys is the same, we can set up an equation:

x × 6 = (x + 12) × 4

Simplifying this equation, we get:

6x = 4x + 48

2x = 48

x = 24

So, the original speed of the jeep was 24 km/hr.

Using this value, we can find the distance covered in each journey:

Distance covered in forward journey = 24 × 6 = 144 km

Distance covered in return journey = (24 + 12) × 4 = 36 × 4 = 144 km

Therefore, the total distance covered by the jeep is:

Total distance = distance covered in forward journey + distance covered in return journey
Total distance = 144 km + 144 km
Total distance = 288 km

The closest answer choice is (D) 228km.
Therefore, the answer is

Question:Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The time for one complete rotation of ball A is 26/2 = 13 minutes. The time for one complete rotation of ball B is 35/5 = 7 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes for both balls to make one complete rotation is lcm(13, 7) = 91 minutes. To find out how long it takes for them to be at the same starting point again, we need to divide the total number of rotations by the time it takes for both balls to make one complete rotation. This gives us 2 * 91 + 5 * 91 = 585 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means that it will take them 585/60 = 9.75 hours to be at the same starting point again. Rounding up to the nearest hour, we get 10 hours and 31 minutes, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let t be the time in hours that it takes for the two ants to meet. Then, we can set up the equation:

distance traveled by ant A = distance traveled by ant B

Since both ants are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds together to get the total distance they travel in one hour:

total distance traveled in one hour = 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour

Using this information, we can write the equation:

distance traveled by ant A = distance traveled by ant B = 15t

Substituting the given value of the distance between the farms into this equation, we get:

15t = 75

Solving for t, we get:

t = 5

Now that we know how long it takes for the ants to meet, we can calculate the distance traveled by ant A:

distance traveled by ant A = 9 cm/hour x 5 hours = 45 cm

Therefore, the answer is (A) 45.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let x be the number of toys made by Jacob. Then, the number of toys made by Alex is 35 - x. We know that Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. Therefore, the total time taken by both of them to make all the toys is 7x + 9(35 - x). Since they have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that this total time is equal to some constant value C. So, we get the equation 7x + 9(35 - x) = C. Solving this equation, we get x = 18. Therefore, Jacob has made 18 toys.

The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let's start by drawing a diagram to represent the situation:

```
     /|
    / |
   /  | h
  /___|
      x
```

In this diagram, `x` represents the distance that the car has traveled since the angle of elevation changed from 45° to 60°. We can use trigonometry to find `x`. Since the angle of elevation is 45°, we know that the height of the tower (`h`) is equal to `x`. And since the angle of elevation is 60°, we know that the height of the tower plus `x` is equal to `x tan(60°)`.

So we have:

```
h = x
h + x = x tan(60°)
```

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

```
x + x = x tan(60°)
2x = x tan(60°)
2 = tan(60°)
2 = √3
```

Therefore, `x = 2√3`.

Now we need to find out how long it took for the car to travel this distance. We know that the car was traveling at a uniform speed, so we can use the formula:

```
distance = rate × time
```

where `rate` is the speed of the car and `time` is the amount of time it took to travel the distance. We don't know the speed of the car, but we do know that it took 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. This means that the car traveled a distance of `2√3` in 10 minutes. So we can set up another equation:

```
2√3 = rate × 10
```

Solving for `rate`, we get:

```
rate = 2√3/10
rate = √3/5
```

Finally, we can use the formula again to find out how long it took for the car to travel the remaining distance to the base of the tower:

```
distance = rate × time
time = distance/rate
time = (h + x)/rate
time = (2√3 + 2√3)/(√3/5)
time = 10√3/√3
time = 10
```

Therefore, it will take the car an additional 10 minutes to reach the base of the tower. The answer is (E).
Therefore, the answer is

(E).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
If Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to travel to a certain city and back by train, it means that the total time taken for the round trip is 17 hours.
If he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train, it means that the actual time taken for the round trip by train is 17 - 4 = 13 hours.
If he had traveled by car in both ways, the total time taken for the round trip would be twice the time taken for one way by car.
Let's assume that the time taken for one way by car is x hours.
Then, the total time taken for the round trip by car would be 2x hours.
We know that the total time taken for the round trip by train was 13 hours, so we can set up an equation:
2x = 13
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6.5
Therefore, the time taken for one way by car is 6.5 hours.
The total time taken for the round trip by car would be 2 * 6.5 = 13 hours.
So the answer is (E).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The distance traveled by the space shuttle in 40 seconds is 700 meters. The time it takes to pass a point is 5 seconds. We can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the length of the space shuttle. In this case, the speed is the distance traveled divided by the time, which is 700 meters / 40 seconds = 17.5 meters/second. The length of the space shuttle is the distance traveled in 5 seconds, which is 17.5 meters/second x 5 seconds = 87.5 meters. The closest answer choice is (D) 125 m.

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let’s assume that the distance between Mumbai and Lucknow is d.
Time taken by train A to reach Lucknow = d/40 Time taken by train B to reach Lucknow = d/72
Since both trains are moving in the same direction, we can add their speeds to find the relative speed at which they approach each other:
Relative speed = 40 + 72 = 112 kmph
Now, let’s assume that they meet t hours after train A starts its journey.
In this time, train A covers a distance of 40t km, while train B covers a distance of 72t km.
Since they meet at the same point, the distance covered by train A must be equal to the distance covered by train B:
d = 40t = 72t
Solving for t, we get:
t = d/36
Substituting this value of t in the equation for the time taken by train A to reach Lucknow, we get:
d/40 = d/36 + t
Simplifying this equation, we get:
t = 4 hours
Therefore, the two trains will meet each other 4 hours after train A starts its journey, which is at 5 pm on the same day.

Therefore, the answer is (C).
Therefore, the answer is

(C). 5 pm on the next day.

Question:A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
Answer: Let's think step by step.
If the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells, then the cost price of each bag is $100 / (1 + 0.25) = $80. The total cost price of all the bags sold is therefore $80 * number of bags sold. Since the grocer made a profit of $3,000, we can set up the equation: $80 * number of bags sold = $3,000 + $80 * number of bags sold * 0.25. Solving this equation gives us: number of bags sold = $3,000 / ($80 - $80 * 0.25) = 40.

Therefore, the answer is (E).

Question:The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let x be the original price and y be the new price after the reduction. We know that y = x - 0.3x = 0.7x. To make the price 100%, we need to increase y to x, so we have x = y + (x - y). Substituting y = 0.7x, we get x = 0.7x + (x - 0.7x), which simplifies to x = 1.4x - 0.7x. Solving for x, we find that x = 2y. Therefore, the percentage increase needed to make the price 100% is (x - y) / y * 100% = (2y - y) / y * 100% = y / y * 100% = 100%. So the answer is (E).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
If Jack paid 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners, then the total cost of white sharpeners would be 18 * x + 18 * y = 100, where x is the number of white sharpeners and y is the number of brown sharpeners. Since we know that the total number of sharpeners is 18, we can write: x + y = 18. We can use these two equations to solve for x and y. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us: x - y = 1. Adding these two equations together gives us: 2x = 19. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 9.5. Since x must be an integer, we can round up to get x = 10. Substituting this value into the second equation gives us: y = 18 - x = 18 - 10 = 8. So Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. The answer is (B).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can solve this problem with algebra. The cost savings is 25% of the cover price, so let x be the cover price. Then we have: 0.25x = $42 - 15x We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 0.25x + 15x = $42 15.25x = $42 Divide both sides by 15.25 to find the value of x: x = $42 / 15.25 x = $2.76 This means that the cover price per issue is $2.76.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
If the fixed salary is $500, then we need to find out what percentage of sales would result in an additional $1000 in salary. This can be done by setting up an equation:

$500 + 0.05x = $1500

where x is the total sales for the month.

Solving for x, we get:

$x = \frac{1000}{0.05} = 20000$

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 so that the shop assistant's monthly salary reaches $1500.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
If the salesperson makes x sales, then his total commission will be 10/100 * 250x = 25x dollars. To reach a salary of at least $1000, the salesperson needs to earn at least $1000 - 25x dollars from his base salary. Since we don't know the base salary, let's assume it is y dollars. Then, the salesperson needs to make at least y + 750 dollars in total. Solving for y, we get y >= 750 - 25x. Substituting this into the equation for the total commission, we get 25x <= 250y. Dividing both sides by 25, we get x <= 10y. Since x and y are positive integers, the smallest possible value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 10. Therefore, the salesperson needs to make at least 10 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let’s assume the cost per pen is x.
Then, total cost of 7200 pens = 7200x
Total revenue from selling 7200 pens = 7200 * 10 = 72000
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = 72000 - 7200x
Since the profit is 25%, we can write:
0.25 * 7200x = 72000 - 7200x
Simplifying this equation, we get:
1800x = 72000
x = 40
Therefore, the cost per pen is Rs. 40.

Therefore, the answer is (E).

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let S be the number of employees who take a summer vacation and W be the number of employees who take a winter vacation. We are told that 0.75W + 0.40(W + S) + 0.20(N + W + S) = N, where N is the total number of employees. Simplifying this equation, we get 0.95W + 0.60S = N. We want to find Q, which is the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. This means that Q is equal to the ratio of the number of employees who take only a summer vacation to the total number of employees. In other words, Q = (0.60S - 0.75W) / N. To solve for Q, we need to express it in terms of known quantities. We know that N = 0.75W + 0.40(W + S) + 0.20(N + W + S), so we can substitute this expression into the equation above to get Q = (0.60(0.75W + 0.40(W + S) + 0.20(N + W + S)) - 0.75W) / (0.75W + 0.40(W + S) + 0.20(N + W + S)). Simplifying this expression, we get Q = (0.45W + 0.24S) / (0.75W + 0.40(W + S) + 0.20(N + W + S)). Now we can plug in the values given in the problem to get Q = (0.45 * 0.75 + 0.24 * 0.40) / (0.75 * 0.75 + 0.40 * (0.75 + 0.40) + 0.20 * (0.75 + 0.40 + 0.20)) = 0.3825 / 1.05 = 0.3627. Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get Q = 36. Therefore, the answer is (C).

Question:Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The median income is the middle value in an ordered list of incomes. Since the median income is $3000, we know that half of the family members earn more than $3000 and half earn less than $3000. Therefore, the total income from the higher-earning half of the family must be greater than or equal to $3000 * 2 = $6000. Similarly, the total income from the lower-earning half of the family must be less than or equal to $3000 * 2 = $6000. Since the total income of the entire family is $9000, we can conclude that the family has at least 3 members (the higher-earning half plus one member from the lower-earning half). However, it is possible that some members of the family have the same income as others, so we cannot definitively say that the family has exactly 3 members. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3.
Therefore, the answer is

(B) 3.

Question:At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can calculate the future value of an investment with the formula FV = PV(1 + r/n)^(nt), where FV is the future value, PV is the present value, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. In this case, we know that FV = $54,080, r = 8%, n = 2 (since the interest is compounded semi-annually), and t = 1/2 (since the investment was for one year). Plugging these values into the formula, we get $54,080 = PV(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1/2). Solving for PV, we get PV = $54,080 / (1.04)^1 = $52,000. So the amount of money that Charles originally invested is $52,000.

Therefore, the answer is (C).

Question:You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

  1. We know that you can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents.
  2. We also know that you can purchase two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents.
  3. To solve this problem, we need to find out how much each item costs individually.
  4. Let's call the cost of one soda "s" and the cost of one energy bar "e".
  5. From the first piece of information, we can set up an equation: s + 2e = 150
  6. From the second piece of information, we can set up another equation: 2s + 3e = 300
  7. Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can use algebra to solve for s and e.
  8. One way to solve this system is to multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second equation. This will eliminate the variable s.
  9. When we do this, we get: -2s - 4e + 2s + 3e = -300 + 300
  10. Simplifying this equation, we get: -e = 0
  11. Therefore, the cost of one energy bar is e = 0 cents.
  12. Now we can substitute this value into either of our original equations to solve for s.
  13. Using the first equation, we get: s + 2(0) = 150
  14. Simplifying this equation, we get: s = 150
  15. Therefore, the cost of one soda is s = 150 cents.
  16. So, to answer your question, one soda costs 150 cents and one energy bar costs 0 cents.
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
One soda costs 150 cents and one energy bar costs 0 cents.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The rate of interest is given by the formula: R = (P * T * I) / (P * T) where P is the principal amount borrowed, T is the time period in years, and I is the interest earned.
In this case, P = Rs. 5000, T = 3 years, and I = Rs. 300. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
R = (5000 * 3 * 300) / (5000 * 3) = 300000 / 15000 = 20%
Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 20%. The correct answer is not among the options provided.

Question:One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let $x$ represent the number of grams of the health food that must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins. Since one gram of the health food provides $\frac{9}{100}$ of the daily requirement of vitamin E and $\frac{8}{100}$ of the daily requirement of vitamin A, we have \begin{align*}
\frac{9}{100}x \geq \text{min daily req for vitamin E}\\
\frac{8}{100}x \geq \text{min daily req for vitamin A}.
\end{align*} Dividing the first inequality by $\frac{9}{100}$ and the second inequality by $\frac{8}{100}$, we find that $$x \geq \frac{100}{9}\text{ min daily req for vitamin E} = \frac{1000}{9}\text{ mg of vitamin E}$$ and $$x \geq \frac{100}{8}\text{ min daily req for vitamin A} = \frac{1250}{8}\text{ mg of vitamin A}.$$ Thus, $x$ must be at least the larger of these two quantities. Since $\frac{1250}{8} > \frac{1000}{9}$, we conclude that $x$ must be at least $\frac{1250}{8}$ mg of vitamin A in order to satisfy both inequalities. The only answer choice which is greater than or equal to $\frac{1250}{8}$ is (C). Therefore, the answer is (C).
Therefore, the answer is

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We can use the fact that if a number is a root of a quadratic equation, then it must satisfy the equation. Plugging in x=1.5 into the equation, we get:

(1.5)^2 + m(1.5) + 22 = 0

Simplifying this expression, we get:

2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0

Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get:

1.5m = -24.75

Dividing both sides by 1.5, we get:

m = -16.5

Answer: Let's think step by step.
The length of the ribbon was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3, which means that for every 5 units of length that were removed, 3 units of length remained. Therefore, if we start with 30 cm and remove 5/8 of it, we will be left with 3/8 of the original length.
To find out what 3/8 of 30 cm is, we can multiply 30 by 3/8:
30 * 3/8 = 11.25

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

The side length of the large cube is 5 cm and the thickness of each wall is 1 cm, so the inner dimensions of the large cube are 5 - 2 = 3 cm. This means that there are 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 small cubes in the large cube. Since each face of a small cube is painted, this means that all 6 faces of each small cube are painted. However, since the large cube has 12 edges, each edge contains two adjacent small cubes sharing one face. Therefore, 12 / 2 = 6 pairs of adjacent small cubes share one face. Since each pair shares one face, this means that 6 faces of the small cubes are not painted. So the answer is (A).

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that U is the midpoint of ST, so the length of ST is twice the length of RU. Therefore, if we let x be the length of RU, then the length of ST is 2x. We also know that the sum of the lengths of RS, RT, and ST is equal to the total distance along the line from R to U. So, we can set up the equation:

RS + RT + ST = RU + US

Substituting in the given values, we get:

5 + 17 + 22 = x + x

Simplifying, we get:

44 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 22/2 = 11

Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let b be the breadth and l be the length of the rectangle. We know that l = 4b + 1 and l * b = 150. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get (4b + 1) * b = 150. Expanding and simplifying, we get 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0. Factoring, we get (b - 6)(4b + 25) = 0. So b = 6 or b = -25/4. Since the width cannot be negative, we take b = 6. Therefore, the length is l = 4 * 6 + 1 = 25. The perimeter is P = 2l + 2b = 2(25) + 2(6) = 62.

To convert cubic meters to liters, we need to multiply by 1000:
Volume in liters = 120 cubic meters x 1000 liters/cubic meter
= 120000 liters
Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 120000 liters.

Therefore, the answer is (D).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:

Question:A rectangle has a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 3 centimeters. Find the perimeter. Answer Choices: (A) 18cm (B) 22cm (C) 20cm (D) 30cm (E) 28cm
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Perimeter is defined as the total distance around a closed figure. For a rectangle, it can be calculated using the formula P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width. Plugging in the given values, we get P = 2(8) + 2(3) = 16 + 6 = 22 cm.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Question:The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The volume of a sphere with radius r is $4/3\pi r^3$. The volume of a cube with side length s is $s^3$. Since the sphere fits inside the cube, we have $r \leq s$, so $(4/3)\pi r^3 \leq s^3$. Dividing both sides by $s^3$ and simplifying gives $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3/s^3 \leq 1$, or $\frac{r^3}{s^3} \leq \frac{3}{4\pi}$. Taking the cube root of both sides gives $\frac{r}{s} \leq \sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4\pi}} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{3}}{\sqrt[3]{4\pi}}$. This means that the ratio of the volumes of the cube and sphere is at most $\frac{s^3}{r^3} = \left(\frac{r}{s}\right)^{-3} = \frac{4\pi}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt[3]{3}}{\sqrt[3]{4\pi}}\right)^{-3} = \frac{4\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{4\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{4\pi}{3} = \frac{64\pi^3}{27}$.

Therefore, the answer is (E).
Therefore, the answer is
Output:
(E).
