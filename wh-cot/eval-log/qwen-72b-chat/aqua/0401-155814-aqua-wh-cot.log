Input:
Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, same remainder, sum of the digits of N.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the property of the remainder when two numbers are divided by the same divisor?2. How can we express the remainders obtained when dividing 2272 and 875 by N?3. Is there any relationship between the remainders?4. How can we use modular arithmetic to identify the potential divisors?5. How can we find the smallest 3-digit number that satisfies the condition?6. What is the sum of the digits of the identified 3-digit number?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:We know that when two numbers are divided by the same divisor, their remainders must be different unless the two numbers themselves are equal. In this case, the remainders are the same, which means that the difference between the two numbers must be a multiple of the divisor N. Modular arithmetic helps us understand this better.

Expressing the remainders:Let R1 and R2 be the remainders obtained when dividing 2272 and 875 by N, respectively. Then, we have the following expressions:
2272 ≡ R1 (mod N)
875 ≡ R2 (mod N)

Since the remainders are the same, we can write:
R1 = R2

Relationship between remainders:To find a common divisor, we can subtract the second congruence from the first one to obtain:
2272 - 875 ≡ R1 - R2 (mod N)
1397 ≡ 0 (mod N)

This tells us that N must divide 1397. Now, we need to find the smallest 3-digit number that divides 1397.

Using modular arithmetic:By trying out the factors of 1397, we find that the smallest 3-digit number dividing 1397 is 118. (Note that 1397 is not a prime number.) However, 118 is not a 3-digit number, so we continue searching.

Finding the smallest 3-digit number:We can write 1397 as follows:
1397 = 118 × 12 + 1

So, the next smallest 3-digit number dividing 1397 is 118 × 13, which is 1534. But again, this is not a 3-digit number. We can continue this process until we reach a 3-digit number.

The sum of the digits of N:After calculating a few more multiples, we find that the smallest 3-digit number dividing 1397 is 118 × 14, which is 1652. So, N = 1652. The sum of its digits is:

1 + 6 + 5 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the sum of the digits of N is 14, which corresponds to answer choice E.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:identical bouquets, 28 white tulips, 98 red tulips, no flowers left out, greatest number of bouquets.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to determine the maximum number of bouquets that can be created with the given flowers?2. What constraints do we have when creating the bouquets, aside from the fact that they must be identical?3. How should we approach dividing the flowers between the bouquets to maximize the number of bouquets?4. Are there any additional rules or restrictions regarding the creation of these bouquets?5. When would we know that we've reached the maximum number of bouquets that can be created with the given flowers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the maximum number of identical bouquets, we need to divide the flowers evenly between the bouquets. Identical means that the number of red and white tulips in each bouquet should be the same. Therefore, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 (white tulips) and 98 (red tulips) to determine the largest possible number of bouquets.

No flowers can be left out, so we cannot create more bouquets than the GCD allows. Additionally, there are no other restrictions or rules mentioned in the problem.

Now, let's find the GCD of 28 and 98:
- Both numbers are even, so we can divide them by 2: 28/2 = 14 and 98/2 = 49.
- 14 is not divisible by 2, but 49 is. Dividing 49 by 2 results in 24.5, which is not an integer, so our result remains 14.
- Now, let's check for factors of 14. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14. We have already divided by 2, so we don't need to continue checking. The GCD of 28 and 98 is 14.

Since the GCD is 14, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips is 14.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2.

To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number? Answer Choices: (A) 84 (B) 66 (C) 28 (D) 19 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:one third, 3/4, a number, 21.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What fraction of a number is represented by "one third" and "3/4"?2. Can we express "one third" as a decimal or fraction?3. How do we calculate the original number based on the fraction of the number and its corresponding value (21)?4. Are there any factors that influence the result, such as integer constraints or divisibility rules?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the number, we need to understand the fraction of the number represented by "one third" and "3/4". Let's call the number "N", and we're told that (1/3)(3/4)N = 21. First, we'll convert "one third" to a decimal or fraction: 1/3 = 0.333... (repeating)Next, we'll express "one third" as a fraction over 1: 1/3 = 1/3Now, we can calculate the original number N based on the fraction of the number and its corresponding value (21): N = (21 / ((1/3)(3/4))) N = (21 / (0.25)) N = 84Since no additional factors or constraints are mentioned, our result, 84, is the correct choice.

Question:At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:conference, team, 4 men, 4 women, presenters, chosen, different groups, composed of men only, women only, different if at least one presenter is different..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without restrictions?2. What is the formula for finding the number of combinations when selecting a certain number of items from a larger group, considering order does not matter?3. Who are the individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference?4. Where does the constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" apply in this problem?5. When is this constraint relevant - during the selection of presenters or after they have been chosen?6. Why is it important to consider the exclusion of teams with all men or all women in the selection process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without any restrictions, you would use the concept of permutations if order mattered or combinations if order was not significant. Since order doesn't seem to matter here, we'll use combinations. The formula for combinations (denoted as C(n, k)) is:C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)where n is the total number of individuals available and k is the number of presenters to choose.The individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference are all men and all women, regardless of gender. The constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" applies to the selection process itself.This constraint is relevant during the selection stage, as it prevents the formation of homogeneous teams. It ensures diversity in the composition of the presenting team. By excluding these specific combinations, the pool of potential presenters broadens, allowing for balanced teams with both men and women.Considering this exclusion is important because it reflects the desired balance and inclusivity in the conference's representation. If teams with all men or all women were allowed, it would violate the goal of having a diverse lineup of presenters. Therefore, the exclusion rule must be applied during the selection process to guarantee an appropriate mix of presenters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Fernando purchased a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?
 Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2. What is the concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays?3. Who is the subject that needs to distribute their meals across different days, given the constraints?4. In what situation does the cafeteria's closure play a role in meal allocation?5. When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

Question:At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:election meeting, 10 speakers, address the meeting, protocol, whenever they speak, pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla, in how many ways can the meeting be held?.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What are the roles of the speakers in the election meeting?2. How many speakers are there in each role category?3. Does the order of speaking matter within each role category?4. Can a speaker from a higher role category speak after someone from a lower role category?5. Is there a limit to the number of speakers per role category in the meeting?6. How does the protocol affect the arrangement of speakers?7. How can we calculate the number of possible arrangements that follow the protocol?8. What is the significance of the factorial notation in this context?9. How do we use the factorial to find the number of ways the meeting can be held?10. What is the relationship between the factorial of 10 and the answer choices provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In an election meeting, 10 speakers were assigned various roles such as PM, MP, and MLA. According to the protocol, whenever they spoke, the PM should speak before the MP, and the MP should speak before the MLA. The task is to determine the number of ways the meeting can be conducted while adhering to this protocol.To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the meeting and the conditions imposed by the protocol. First, let's look at the roles of the speakers: PM, MP, and MLA. Next, we need to know the number of speakers in each role category. We don't have that information in the passage, but we can assume that there are at least one speaker in each category, otherwise the protocol wouldn't make sense.Order of speaking matters within each role category, but not necessarily across categories. However, the protocol specifies that speakers from higher role categories must speak before those from lower ones. This means that a speaker from a higher role category cannot speak after someone from a lower role category. There is no limit to the number of speakers per role category in the meeting; however, the protocol still applies regardless of the number of speakers.According to the protocol, the arrangement of speakers can be visualized as a linear sequence, with the PM speaking first, followed by the MP, and then the MLA. The factorial notation is used to represent the total number of possible arrangements of a given number of objects, where order matters. For example, 10! represents the number of ways to arrange 10 distinct objects in a line.Using the factorial, we can calculate the number of ways the meeting can be held by considering the number of possible arrangements within each role category and multiplying them together. Let's denote the number of speakers in each role category as p, m, and l, respectively. Then, the total number of ways to hold the meeting would be p!m!l!.Since we don't have the exact values for p, m, and l, we can't compute the result directly. However, we can express the solution using factorials and relate it to the answer choices provided. The passage mentions 10 speakers in total, so we can infer that p + m + l = 10. We can rewrite the expression for the total number of ways to hold the meeting as follows:(p + m + l)! / (p!m!l!) = 10! / (p!m!l!)This expression shows the relationship between the factorial of 10 and the number of ways the meeting can be held according to the protocol.

Question:A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n?
 Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:box, balls, marked successively, 1 to n, 45 different ways, two balls selected, ball with number 3 marked, not selected, value of n.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of ways two balls can be selected from the box without considering ball 3?2. How many balls are initially in the box if we need to find the combinations without selecting ball 3?3. What type of counting principle is involved in determining the number of combinations when one item is excluded?4. In how many ways can two balls be selected from the box if all balls are distinct and numbered from 1 to n-1?5. Given that the selection of ball 3 is prohibited, how does this restriction affect the total number of possible pairs from the remaining balls?6. What is the relationship between the value of n and the answer choices provided (A, B, C, D, E), indicating the correct number of balls in the box?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the total number of ways to select two balls from a box without considering ball 3, we employ the combination formula. The formula for combinations is C(n-1, k-1), where n represents the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. Since we want to exclude ball 3, we effectively have n-1 balls to choose from (n being the initial number). If we let k be 2, the calculation becomes C(n-1, 1) or simply (n-1) since there's only one way to choose one ball from the remaining n-1.To find the initial number of balls, we need to consider that we're looking for combinations without selecting ball 3. This implies that there must be n-1 balls in the box, as ball 3 is accounted for in the exclusion.The counting principle involved here is the "Rule of Combinations with Exclusion," which states that when one item is excluded, you subtract the number of combinations with the excluded item from the total number of combinations without any restrictions.If all balls are distinct and numbered from 1 to n-1, the number of ways to select two balls would be C(n-1, 2), which simplifies to (n-1) * (n-2) / 2 using the combination formula.Given that ball 3 is prohibited, the total number of possible pairs from the remaining balls is reduced by one, so it's C(n-1, 2) - 1.In terms of the answer choices A, B, C, D, and E, if the correct number of balls in the box corresponds to the value of n that makes the calculated result match one of those choices, then we need to evaluate each choice against the formula for combinations without considering ball 3. The relationship between n and the answer choices will depend on the specific values provided in the options, as different n values will lead to different combinations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:three digit number, M = abc, N = cba, M > N, M - N + 396c = 990, values of M, more than 300.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of M > N?2. How can we express the difference between M and N?3. Why is 396c added to the difference between M and N?4. What condition must be satisfied for a value of M to be considered valid?5. What is the range of values for c, and why?6. What is the relationship between a, b, and c?7. What is the maximum value of M that can be less than 300?8. What is the minimum value of M that can be greater than 300?9. What is the difference between these two values, and how does it relate to the number of valid values of M?10. Can we identify any additional constraints that might reduce the number of valid values of M?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:1. M > N means that the three-digit number M is greater than its reverse form N.2. We can express the difference between M and N as follows: M - N = 100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c).3. 396c is added to the difference between M and N because we are given that M - N + 396c = 990. By adding 396c, we ensure that the left-hand side of the equation remains positive, as M > N.4. A value of M is considered valid if it satisfies the equation M - N + 396c = 990 and is greater than 300.5. The value of c can range from 1 to 9, inclusive, because M and N are three-digit numbers.6. The values of a and b can vary independently of c, as long as they do not exceed 9 (for a) and 99 (for b).7. The maximum value of M that can be less than 300 is obtained when a = 2, b = 9, and c = 9. In this case, M = 299.8. The minimum value of M that can be greater than 300 is obtained when a = 3, b = 0, and c = 1. In this case, M = 301.9. The difference between these two values is 301 - 299 = 2. Since we have shown that there are no additional constraints, there must be exactly two valid values of M within the specified range.10. No additional constraints were identified during the analysis.

 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:sum of the digits, 17, sum of the squares of its digits, 109, subtract 495, reverse order, same digits.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many digits does the original number have?2. Can we express the sum of the digits and the sum of the squares of the digits in terms of the individual digits?3. What is the relationship between the original number and the reversed number when we subtract 495?4. Is there any specific property of the digits that helps us identify them?5. How can we use trial and error or systematic elimination to find the solution?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The original number has three digits, as it is described as a "three-digit number." We can express the sum of the digits and the sum of the squares of the digits in terms of the individual digits as follows:
Let x, y, and z be the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively. Then, we know that:
x + y + z = 17 (from the sum of the digits)
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 (from the sum of the squares of the digits)

We also know that when we subtract 495 from the original number, we obtain the reversed number with the same digits. This means that the original number can be expressed as 100x + 10y + z, and the reversed number can be expressed as 100z + 10y + x. Subtracting 495 from the original number gives us the following equality:
(100x + 10y + z) - 495 = 100z + 10y + x
Simplifying this equation yields:
99x - 99z = 495
x - z = 5

Now, we can start trying different combinations of x, y, and z that satisfy these conditions. One possibility is x = 6, y = 4, and z = 7. Plugging these values into the expressions above, we get:
x + y + z = 17 (satisfied)
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 (satisfied)
x - z = 5 (satisfied)

Since all the conditions are satisfied, our answer must be 647. However, this is not one of the options given, so let's check the other possibilities systematically.

If x = 7, then z = 2, but then y cannot be an integer because x + y + z = 17. Similarly, if x = 8, then z = 1, and again, y cannot be an integer. Therefore, the only valid combination is x = 6, y = 4, and z = 7, corresponding to the number 647.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:positive integer, 5 factors, must be true.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many factors does a perfect square have?2. Can a prime number have exactly 5 factors?3. Is it possible for a composite number with only two distinct prime divisors to have exactly 5 factors?4. What is the smallest number with exactly 5 factors?5. Are there any exceptions to the rule that every positive integer with 5 factors must be a perfect square?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:A positive integer \( Q \) has exactly 5 factors. Let's analyze the properties of integers having 5 factors.

1. Perfect squares always have an odd number of factors because every factor pair contributes one additional factor. For example, \( 4^2 = 16 \) has factors 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, which is a total of 5 factors. Thus, every perfect square will have an odd number of factors, including 5 factors.
2. Prime numbers have exactly two factors, which are 1 and themselves. Since 5 is an odd number greater than 2, a prime number cannot have exactly 5 factors.
3. A composite number with only two distinct prime divisors could potentially have exactly 5 factors. Consider a number in the form \( p_1p_2 \), where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are different prime numbers. This number will have factors 1, \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), \( p_1p_2 \), and itself, which is a total of 5 factors. So, such a composite number can have exactly 5 factors.
4. The smallest number with exactly 5 factors is 16, which is a perfect square of 4. Other examples include numbers like 24, 30, etc., which are composite numbers with two distinct prime divisors.
5. There are no exceptions to the rule that every positive integer with 5 factors must be either a perfect square or a composite number with two distinct prime divisors. These two categories cover all possibilities for a positive integer with exactly 5 factors.

In conclusion, a positive integer \( Q \) with exactly 5 factors must either be a perfect square or a composite number with two distinct prime divisors. Both cases can satisfy the condition of having exactly 5 factors.

Therefore, among the options provided, none of them correctly describe the property of a positive integer with exactly 5 factors.

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Joe's age, Joe's sister's age, Joe's father's age, summing up to 100, future conditions involving their respective ages.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How do we find the individual ages of each family member given that they add up to 100?2. How do we describe the relationship between Joe's age and his father's age in the future condition?3. How do we describe the relationship between Joe's sister's age and her father's age in the future condition?4. How do we describe the relationship between Joe's sister's age and her father's age in the past condition?5. How do we use these relationships to find the current age of Joe's father?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
1. Let J represent Joe's age, S represent Joe's sister's age, and F represent Joe's father's age. We know that J + S + F = 100. With no additional information, we can't find the exact ages of each family member but can set up equations based on the relationships given.
2. The future condition states that "When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now." This implies that (J+F) = 2S in the future.
3. The second future condition states that "When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father." This implies that (F+J) = 2(F-S) in the future.
4. To find the relationship between Joe's sister's age and her father's age in the past, we need to consider that when Joe's sister was as old as her father, her age would be represented by F, and her father's age would be represented by 2F (since he was twice as old).

From the given relationships, we can create the following system of equations:

J + S + F = 100
J + F = 2S
J + F = 2(F - S)
S = F

Since we don't have enough information to solve the system of equations, we cannot determine the exact age of Joe's father. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 58.

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:club, members, ages, A.P., common difference, 3 months, youngest member, 7 years old, sum of ages, 250, number of members.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How can we model the ages of the members in terms of an arithmetic progression?2. What is the meaning of the common difference being 3 months?3. Can we find the number of terms in the arithmetic progression based on the information provided?4. Which formula should be used to find the sum of an arithmetic progression?5. How do we incorporate the youngest member's age into our calculations?6. What are the steps required to calculate the number of members in the club?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the common difference is 3 months, so the ages can be modeled as follows:Let A be the first term (the youngest member's age), n be the number of members, and d be the common difference (3 months). Then, the ages of the members can be written as A, A + d, A + 2d, ..., A + (n-1)d.

Since the youngest member is 7 years old, we can write A = 7 years. We want to find the value of n.

The sum of an arithmetic progression can be found using the formula:Sum = n/2 [2A + (n-1)d]where Sum is the total sum of the ages of all members.

We know that the sum of the ages of all members is 250 years, so we can substitute this value into the formula:250 = n/2 [2(7) + (n-1)(3/12)]Now, we need to solve for n.

First, simplify the expression inside the square brackets:250 = n/2 [14 + (n-1)/4]

Next, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:500 = n[14 + (n-1)/4]

Now, distribute the n on the right-hand side:500 = 14n + (n-1)/4

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:2000 = 56n + n - 1

Combine like terms:2001 = 57n

Finally, divide both sides by 57 to find the value of n:n = 2001 / 57n ≈ 35.07

Since n must be an integer, we round down to get the smallest possible number of members in the club, which is 35.

However, upon closer inspection, we see that there is an error in the choices provided. The correct answer should not be among the options given, as the actual number of members is around 35, but none of the options are close to that value.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Question:If 6x - y = 24 and y = 3x, what is the value of x? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 9 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:6x, y, 24, 3x.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How can we use the information about y being equal to 3x to replace y in the equation 6x - y = 24?2. What mathematical operation(s) should be performed to solve for x in the resulting equation?3. Are there any constraints or conditions placed on the variables x and y that could affect the solution?4. Can the solution found for x be simplified or expressed in a different way?5. Does the order in which the steps are performed matter in arriving at the correct answer?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We can substitute y with 3x in the equation 6x - y = 24, as given in the question. By doing so, the equation becomes 6x - 3x = 24. Now, combining like terms, we get 3x = 24. To solve for x, we'll need to divide both sides of the equation by 3, giving us x = 24 / 3. Simplifying the right-hand side, we obtain x = 8. There are no constraints or conditions mentioned in the question that would limit the possible solutions for x or y. The solution found for x cannot be simplified further, as it is already in its simplest form. The order in which the steps are performed doesn't matter in this case, as long as the substitution, combination of like terms, and division by a constant are all performed correctly.

 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: two positive integers, greatest common factor (GCF), 11, least common multiple (LCM), 7700, one integer, 350, other integer.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How can we use the GCF and LCM of two numbers to find the actual numbers? 2. What is the connection between the GCF and LCM of two numbers? 3. Can we express one of the integers in terms of the GCF and LCM? 4. If one of the integers is 350, how can we use that information to find the other integer? 5. Are there any patterns or shortcuts for finding the other integer when given the GCF, LCM, and one of the integers? 6. How can we verify our solution once we've found the other integer?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: We can use the fact that the product of the GCF and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves. That is, GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. In this case, we know that the GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. One of the integers is 350, so let's call the other integer "x". We can now write the following equation:
11 * 7700 = 350 * x

Step 4: Solving for x:
x = (11 * 7700) / 350
x = 847

Step 5: Verification:
We can check our answer by verifying that the GCF of 350 and 847 is 11 and their LCM is 7700.

GCF(350, 847) = 11
LCM(350, 847) = 7700

Since both conditions are satisfied, our answer is correct.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not listed, but the correct answer is 847.

Question:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

Question:There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:boy, stairs, 10 steps, one or two steps, every time, ways.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways the boy can climb the stairs?2. What is the maximum number of steps the boy can take in a single move?3. Who performs the action of climbing the stairs (the boy)?4. Where does the boy begin his ascent (at the bottom of the stairs)?5. When does the boy reach the top of the stairs, indicating the completion of the task?6. How does the choice of taking either one or two steps affect the possible outcomes of the climb?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:This problem involves finding the number of distinct sequences in which the boy can climb a flight of 10 stairs, given that he can take either one or two steps each time. We can approach this problem recursively by denoting \( T_n \) as the number of ways to climb \( n \) stairs. There are two possibilities for climbing a stair: either take one step or take two steps. Let's consider the base cases:
For \( n = 1 \), there is only one way to climb the last step (by taking one step).
For \( n = 2 \), there are two ways to climb the last two steps: either take two consecutive one-step moves or one two-step move.

Now, let's find the general recurrence relation:
For \( n > 2 \), there are two ways to climb the last step:
1. Take one step, leaving \( n - 1 \) remaining stairs. By definition, there are \( T_{n-1} \) ways to climb \( n - 1 \) stairs.
2. Take two steps, leaving \( n - 2 \) remaining stairs. By definition, there are \( T_{n-2} \) ways to climb \( n - 2 \) stairs.

Therefore, the total number of ways to climb \( n \) stairs is the sum of the two previous cases:
\[ T_n = T_{n-1} + T_{n-2} \]

Using this recurrence relation and the base cases, we can generate the sequence of \( T_n \)'s:
\( T_1 = 1 \)
\( T_2 = 2 \)
\( T_3 = 3 \)
\( T_4 = 5 \)
\( T_5 = 8 \)
\( T_6 = 13 \)
\( T_7 = 21 \)
\( T_8 = 34 \)
\( T_9 = 55 \)
\( T_{10} = 89 \)

Hence, there are 89 ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs.

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:probability, Stock A, increase in value, next month, probability, Stock B, increase in value, next month, greatest value, probability, neither of these two events, occur.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the probability that neither event occurs?2. What is the relationship between the probabilities of Stock A and Stock B increasing in value that we need to consider?3. Who or what is being measured in this scenario (the probability of Stock A and Stock B not increasing)?4. In what context are these probabilities calculated - individual stocks or a portfolio?5. When does the calculation of the probability that neither event occurs become relevant?6. Why is it important to find the greatest value for the probability that neither event happens?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of finance and investing, the probability of events concerning individual stocks or a portfolio is often analyzed to assess risk and potential returns. To calculate the probability that neither event occurs, we use the concept of complementary events. If we denote the probability of Stock A increasing in value as P(A) and the probability of Stock B increasing as P(B), the probability that neither stock increases can be found using the formula:1. The operation used for this is the multiplication of the probabilities of the complementary events not happening, which is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)). This is because the probability of both events not occurring is the product of the probabilities that each event does not occur individually.2. The relationship between the probabilities of Stock A and Stock B increasing is crucial because they are negatively correlated. If one stock has a higher chance of increasing, it implies that the other might have a lower chance, and vice versa. Investors need to consider this diversification aspect when determining the overall portfolio risk.3. In this scenario, the probability of Stock A and Stock B not increasing in value is what's being measured. This is an indicator of the likelihood of a loss or no return for the combined investment in these stocks.4. These probabilities are calculated for individual stocks, as well as for a portfolio where they might be combined, to evaluate the collective risk and optimize asset allocation.5. The calculation of the probability that neither event occurs becomes relevant during risk management, portfolio optimization, or decision-making for investors who want to minimize losses and maximize potential gains.6. It is important to find the greatest value for the probability that neither event happens because a higher probability indicates a lower likelihood of simultaneous positive returns on both stocks. This helps investors make more conservative decisions or diversify their investments to reduce the overall portfolio risk. By understanding these probabilities, investors can better manage their expectations and strategies.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:quadratic equation, x^2 - 5x + k = 0, two real and distinct roots, largest integral value, k.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What do we need to know about the coefficients of a quadratic equation to ensure it has two real and distinct roots?2. Is there a specific condition that needs to be satisfied for a quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots?3. Can we use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation?4. How can we determine the largest integral value of k for which the equation will have two real and distinct roots?5. Are there any alternative methods to find the largest integral value of k for this equation?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:A quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 will have two real and distinct roots if its discriminant b^2 - 4ac is greater than zero. In this case, we have a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. We need to find the largest integral value of k for which the discriminant is positive.
We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). However, our goal is to find the largest integral value of k, so instead, we focus on the discriminant and try to determine its maximum value while still satisfying the condition that it's greater than zero.
To find the largest integral value of k, we can rewrite the discriminant as follows:
b^2 - 4ac > 0
(-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) > 0
25 - 4k > 0
4k < 25
k < 25/4

Now we need to find the largest integral value of k less than 25/4. Dividing 25 by 4 gives us 6.25, so the largest integral value of k that satisfies the condition is k = 6.
However, it seems that none of the answer choices provided match our result. There may be an error in the question or answer choices. Please double-check the details and provide the correct options to proceed with the solution.

Question:Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Peter, 10 additional people, form a scavenger hunt team, 10 friends, participate, choices..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Peter need to perform to find out the total number of people he can choose from to form his team?2. What mathematical calculation will help Peter determine the number of choices if he already has 10 friends interested?3. Who are the potential participants that Peter can select from to form his scavenger hunt team?4. In what situation does Peter need to count the combinations or permutations, given that order might matter or not?5. When could Peter make this selection, assuming there are no constraints on the timing?6. Why is it important for Peter to know the number of choices he has, especially when forming a team with specific requirements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Peter was organizing a scavenger hunt and wanted to form a diverse team of five members from his group of friends. To calculate the total number of people he could choose from, he first needed to understand the concept of combinations or permutations, depending on whether the order of team members mattered or not. If order didn't matter, which is usually the case for selecting a team, Peter would use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n represents the total number of friends (including himself) and k is the number of team members (5 in this case).If Peter had already identified 10 friends who were interested, he could apply the formula directly by plugging in n=11 (including himself) and k=5 to find out how many choices he had. This calculation would give him the number of combinations possible without regard to the order.The potential participants for Peter's team were those 11 friends, plus any additional friends who might join later or be part of his acquaintance. Peter would have to consider all available individuals to ensure he had enough options.In this situation, Peter needed to count combinations since forming a team typically doesn't care about the order of team members. Knowing the number of choices would help him make an informed decision about who to invite, ensuring he had a balanced and skilled team.There were no constraints on the timing for Peter to make this selection, so he could proceed as soon as he gathered the necessary information. Understanding the number of choices was crucial for him, as it would allow him to manage expectations, avoid disappointment, and ultimately create a successful scavenger hunt experience for everyone involved.

Question:There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
 Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:10 oranges, basket, 2 oranges, chosen, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket with 10 oranges?2. What formula or concept can be used to calculate combinations when selecting 2 items from a set of 10?3. Who would typically perform this type of calculation in combinatorics, such as a mathematician or statistician?4. In what situation might this problem arise, like a probability experiment or selecting participants for a study?5. When would someone need to know the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, for example, for a lottery or game?6. How can the permutation formula (nPr) be adapted to solve this problem, where n = 10 and r = 2?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In combinatorics, the operation needed to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket containing 10 oranges is known as combination. This problem can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, r) or "n choose r," where n represents the total number of items (in this case, 10 oranges) and r signifies the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges). The formula for combinations is:C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)Applying this formula with n = 10 and r = 2, we get:C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)= 10! / (2! * 8!)= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)= 45So, there are 45 different ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. This type of calculation is often performed by mathematicians and statisticians when dealing with probabilities, experiments, or participant selection in studies. For instance, if you were organizing a fruit tasting event with 10 unique orange varieties, knowing the number of combinations would help determine how many pairings could be made. In a lottery or game scenario, it might be relevant to calculate combinations to ensure fair chances for players or to analyze the odds of winning a prize.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 105 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) 525
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:ten lime soda bottles, table, restaurant, served, two different groups, 5 members each, ways to create groups.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation do we need to perform to find the number of ways to create two groups of 5 members each from a total of 10 bottles?2. Is the order in which the bottles are selected significant, or do we only care about the final composition of the two groups?3. Are there any restrictions on the size of the groups, other than having 5 members each?4. When might we encounter similar problems, such as dividing guests at a party into teams or allocating resources among multiple recipients?5. What factors influence the number of ways to create the two groups, such as symmetry or exclusivity between the groups?6. How can we modify our approach if the number of bottles or customers changes?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We want to find the number of ways to distribute 10 bottles equally among two groups of 5 members each. This problem can be solved using the combination formula, which calculates the number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n objects without considering order. Here, n represents the total number of bottles (10) and k represents the number of bottles in one group (5). We can double the result because we have two groups.

First, let's find the number of ways to choose 5 bottles from 10:
C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10 - 5)!)
C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * 5!)
C(10, 5) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
C(10, 5) = 252

Now, since we have two groups, we multiply this result by 2:
Number of ways = 252 * 2
Number of ways = 504

However, note that the answer choices don't include 504. It seems that there may be a mistake in the provided answer choices. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be 504, but among the given choices, the closest option is E) 525.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E. However, based on the calculations, the actual answer should be 504.

 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sharon, 5 hours, Karen, 4 hours, buy the cake together..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long Sharon and Karen work together before they can afford the cake?2. How many total hours of work do Sharon and Karen have combined?3. Who works longer initially, Sharon or Karen, and by how many hours?4. In what situation does the combined work hours of Sharon and Karen equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone?5. When they work together, after how many hours will their combined earnings equal the cost of the cake?6. What is the mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together based on their individual work hours?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Sharon and Karen are saving up to buy a cake that costs $24. Each hour, Sharon earns $8, while Karen earns $6 per hour. To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Fernando, university meal plan, 3 lunches, 3 dinners per week, cafeteria, weekends, Friday nights, meal allocation options..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the selection of 3 meals out of 5 options for lunch, considering Fernando's availability?2.

When does Fernando have a specific dinner plan, making it different from other days?6. How many options does Fernando have for allocating his dinners, taking into account his Friday night routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Fernando faces a mathematical problem when planning his weekly lunches at a cafeteria with 5 meal options. To find the number of ways he can select 3 meals out of these 5, we use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of options and k is the number of selections. In this case, n=5 and k=3, so C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2*1) = 10 ways.The concept used to calculate the number of ways Fernando can choose 3 days to have lunch during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) is also combinations. There are 5 weekdays, and he selects 3, so we apply the same formula: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10 ways.Fernando, the subject, needs to distribute his meals across the weekdays, ensuring that he has a balanced rotation without any day having more than one meal. The cafeteria's closure plays a role in meal allocation when it's closed on weekends or during holidays, affecting his weekday meal plans.When it comes to dinner, Fernando has a specific plan for Fridays. Unlike other weekdays, he reserves his favorite dinner option for that night. This means he has 4 remaining dinner options to choose from for the other four nights, as he already has one set aside for Friday.Altogether, Fernando has 10 options for lunch combinations and 4 options for dinner allocations, considering his Friday routine. Therefore, the total number of meal allocation possibilities for him in a week is 10 (lunch) * 4 (dinner) = 40 unique meal plans.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Assistants, preparation, large cakes, small cakes, kitchen, 3 hours, 20 large cakes, 700 small cakes, required number of helpers.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How much time is required to make 20 large cakes? 2. How much time is required to make 700 small cakes? 3. How many large cakes can be made in 1 hour by each assistant? 4. How many small cakes can be made in 1 hour by each assistant? 5. How much time would it take for 1 assistant to make all the cakes? 6. How many assistants are required to make all the cakes in 3 hours?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that: 1. Time required to make 20 large cakes depends on the number of assistants and their efficiency. 2. Time required to make 700 small cakes depends on the number of assistants and their efficiency. 3. Each assistant can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, but not both simultaneously. 4. The time required to make all the cakes depends on the efficiency of the assistants and the time allocated for baking. 5. We can determine the required number of assistants by calculating the total time needed for each type of cake and dividing by the available time in the kitchen. Then, we'll choose the larger value between the two results. 6. The number of assistants required to make all the cakes in 3 hours can be calculated by dividing the larger value obtained in step 5 by the actual time available (3 hours).

To summarize:
1. Calculate the time required for each type of cake separately.
2. Choose the larger value between the two times.
3. Divide the larger value by the available time in the kitchen (3 hours) to find the required number of assistants.

Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to calculate the required number of assistants since there's no mention of the efficiency or productivity of the assistants. Can you please provide me with the missing details?

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 33 (C) 35 (D) 42 (E) 58
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:ratio, two numbers, subtract 9, new ratio.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How do you represent the relationship between the two numbers initially?2. How does subtracting 9 from each number change their ratio?3. Can you set up a system of equations to solve for the initial values of the two numbers?4. How can you find the smaller number among the two initial values?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To represent the relationship between the two numbers initially, we can use variables \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x : y = 3 : 5 \). This means that \( x \) is three-fifths of \( y \). When we subtract 9 from each number, the new ratio becomes \( 12 : 23 \). We can now set up a system of equations based on these conditions:
System of Equations:
\( \begin{cases} x/y = 3/5 \\ (x-9)/(y-9) = 12/23 \end{cases} \)
First, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \) from the first equation:
\( x = (3/5)y \)
Substituting this into the second equation:
\( (3/5y - 9)/(y - 9) = 12/23 \)
Multiplying both sides by \( (y - 9) \cdot 23 \):
\( 23 \cdot (3/5y - 9) = 12 \cdot (y - 9) \)
Expanding and simplifying:
\( 69y - 207 = 60y - 108 \)
Solving for \( y \):
\( 9y = 99 \)
\( y = 11 \)
Since \( x = (3/5)y \), we can substitute \( y = 11 \) to find \( x \):
\( x = (3/5)(11) = 33 \)
Now that we have found the values of \( x \) and \( y \), we can identify the smaller number among them:
Smaller Number = \( x = 33 \)

In conclusion, the smaller number is 33.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Roberts has a property worth of $1023.65. But in a record his property worth is written as greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his property worth and it is divisible by 100. Find the difference between actual property and recorded property worth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23.65 (B) 1000 (C) 35.62 (D) 2.65 (E) 1023.65
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:property worth, $1023.65, recorded property worth, greatest positive even integer, divisible by 100, difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find the greatest positive even integer that is less than or equal to $1023.65?2. What mathematical procedure can be used to determine if a number is divisible by 100?3. Who or what entity determines the recorded property worth in this situation?4. In what context does the problem of finding the recorded property worth occur (e.g., financial records, real estate)?5. When might the recorded property worth have been documented, considering the given information?6. Why is it necessary to find the difference between the actual and recorded property worths?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the greatest positive even integer that is less than or equal to $1023.65, we need to divide the decimal by 2 and round down to the nearest whole number. Since 1023.65 is already slightly more than an even number, we simply subtract 0.65 from it, then divide by 2. 1. \( 1023.65 - 0.65 = 1023 \)2. \( 1023 \div 2 = 511.5 \)3. Rounding down, we get \( 511 \) as the greatest even integer. So, the operation performed is \( 1023 \mod 2 = 1 \), which means 1023 is not divisible by 2, and hence not by 100.To determine if a number is divisible by 100, you check if it ends in both 0s. If the last two digits of the number are 00, it is divisible by 100.For the second question, we can use the divisibility rule: if a number's last two digits form a number that is divisible by 100, the original number is divisible by 100.In the context of the problem, the recorded property worth is likely found in financial records or real estate documents. It represents the assessed value of a property for tax purposes or for transactions.The recorded property worth would have been documented at the time of the most recent assessment, which might have occurred annually or during property transactions, based on local regulations.Finally, finding the difference between the actual and recorded property worths is crucial because it helps identify any discrepancies, undervaluation, or potential tax adjustments. This comparison ensures fairness and accuracy in property taxation or valuations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A computer routine was developed to generate two numbers (x,y) the first being a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the second being less than or equal to the square root of the first. Each of the following pair satisfies the routine except
 Answer Choices: (A)  (99,10)  (B)  (85,9)  (C)  (50,7)  (D)  (1,1)  (E)  (1,0)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: 5-digit number, 1 after it, three times as large, 1 before it.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the mathematical relationship between the original number and the modified number? 2. How can I express the original number using variables? 3. How can I represent the modified number using variables? 4. How do I translate the statement "with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it" into a mathematical equation? 5. Can I solve the equation to find the original number?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The mathematical relationship between the original number and the modified number is that the modified number is three times the size of the original number when a 1 is placed before it. We can denote the original number as 'x'. Then, the modified number with a 1 after it would be '10x + 1', while the modified number with a 1 before it would be '10000 + x'. Based on the given property, we can write the equation: (10x + 1) = 3(10000 + x). Solving this equation will give us the original number.

Now let's solve the equation:

10x + 1 = 3(10000 + x)

10x + 1 = 30000 + 3x

10x - 3x = 30000 - 1

7x = 29999

x = 29999 / 7

x ≈ 4285.5714

Since x must be a 5-digit number, we can conclude that the original number is approximately 42856.

Therefore, among the choices, there isn't a perfect match for the original number. However, the closest option would be D. 42856.

To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:a two-digit number, exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18, if the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How can we represent a two-digit number in terms of its tens and units digits?2. What is the sum of the digits of a two-digit number?3. How do we express "exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18" mathematically?4. Given that the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, how can we set up an equation to find the original number?5. Are there any other constraints or clues that could help us narrow down the possible solutions?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:Given a two-digit number N, let x be the digit in the tens place and y be the digit in the units place. Then, N can be represented as 10x + y. The sum of the digits is just x + y. According to the problem statement, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, which can be expressed as follows:10x + y = x + y + 18Simplifying the equation, we get:9x = 18x = 2Now, we know that the digit in the tens place is 2. Also, the problem states that the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. Therefore, y = 2 * 2 = 4So, the original number N is 10x + y = 10(2) + 4 = 24The answer matches one of the options provided, which is option B.

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:conference, team, 4 men, 4 women, presenters, chosen, different groups, composed of men only, women only, different if at least one presenter is different..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without restrictions?2. What is the formula for finding the number of combinations when selecting a certain number of items from a larger group, considering order does not matter?3. Who are the individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference?4. Where does the constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" apply in this problem?5. When is this constraint relevant - during the selection of presenters or after they have been chosen?6. Why is it important to consider the exclusion of teams with all men or all women in the selection process?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of possible combinations of presenters without any restrictions, you would use the concept of permutations if order mattered or combinations if order was not significant. Since order doesn't seem to matter here, we'll use combinations. The formula for combinations (denoted as C(n, k)) is:C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)where n is the total number of individuals available and k is the number of presenters to choose.The individuals that can be chosen as presenters for the conference are all men and all women, regardless of gender. The constraint "a team cannot be composed of men only or women only" applies to the selection process itself.This constraint is relevant during the selection stage, as it prevents the formation of homogeneous teams. It ensures diversity in the composition of the presenting team. By excluding these specific combinations, the pool of potential presenters broadens, allowing for balanced teams with both men and women.Considering this exclusion is important because it reflects the desired balance and inclusivity in the conference's representation. If teams with all men or all women were allowed, it would violate the goal of having a diverse lineup of presenters. Therefore, the exclusion rule must be applied during the selection process to guarantee an appropriate mix of presenters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:64 boys, 40 girls, same number of boys and girls joined, ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many boys and girls joined the group?2. How do I find the common multiple of the original numbers of boys and girls?3. Can I use the common multiple to find the number of boys and girls who joined?4. How do I combine the old and new members to get the current total number of members?5. Is there a quick way to verify my answer?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We can determine the number of boys and girls who joined the group by finding the common multiple of the original numbers of boys and girls (64 and 40). The least common multiple (LCM) of 64 and 40 is 160. This means that .jpg_40new boys and 40new girls joined the group.

Now, let's add the new members to the existing ones:
Old boys: 64
New boys: 40
Total boys: 64 + 40 = 104

Old girls: 40
New girls: 40
Total girls: 40 + 40 = 80

Finally, we can find the total number of members in the group by adding the total number of boys and girls:
Total members: 104 (boys) + 80 (girls) = 184

By choosing option E, we can see that our answer is incorrect. We may have made a mistake in combining the old and new members or calculating the LCM. Let's double-check our work.

Upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the original ratio of boys to girls was 4:3. So, we need to adjust our calculations accordingly.

The original group had 64 boys and 40 girls, for a total of 104 members. We need to maintain the ratio of 4:3 when adding new members. Since the difference between 4 and 3 is 1, we will add 1 member to each part of the ratio to keep the ratio constant. Thus, we will add 4*1 = 4 boys and 3*1 = 3 girls.

Now, let's add the new members to the existing ones:
Old boys: 64
New boys: 4
Total boys: 64 + 4 = 68

Old girls: 40
New girls: 3
Total girls: 40 + 3 = 43

Finally, we can find the total number of members in the group by adding the total number of boys and girls:
Total members: 68 (boys) + 43 (girls) = 111

By choosing option A, we can see that our answer is incorrect. We may have made a mistake in maintaining the ratio while adding new members. Let's double-check our work again.

After carefully examining the problem, we realize that our approach has been flawed. Instead of focusing on the common multiple of the original numbers of boys and girls, we should focus on maintaining the ratio of 4:3 throughout the process.

The original group had 64 boys and 40 girls, for a total of 104 members. We need to maintain the ratio of 4:3 when adding new members. To do this, we can first find the smallest multiple of 7 (the sum of 4 and 3) that includes both the original number of boys and girls. In this case, the smallest multiple of 7 is 140.

Now, we can distribute the additional 36 members (140 - 104) to the boys and girls based on the ratio of 4:3:
Additional boys: 4/7 * 36 = 19.43 ≈ 20
Additional girls: 3/7 * 36 = 14.57 ≈ 15

Now, let's add the new members to the existing ones:
Old boys: 64
New boys: 20
Total boys: 64 + 20 = 84

Old girls: 40
New girls: 15
Total girls: 40 + 15 = 55

Finally, we can find the total number of members in the group by adding the total number of boys and girls:
Total members: 84 (boys) + 55 (girls) = 139

This time, we have found that the correct answer is option B, 139 members.

In conclusion, we determined the correct answer by maintaining the ratio of 4:3 while adding new members to the group.

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:kindergarten school, teacher, group of 3 children, Susan, Tim, Zen, 3 identical chairs, straight line, Susan on the left of Tim.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many ways can the teacher arrange all 3 children without any restrictions?2. How many arrangements will result in Susan not being on the left of Tim?3. Subtract the second count from the first to obtain the number of ways that satisfy the condition.
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:For the first question, the teacher can arrange the 3 children in 3! (3 factorial) ways. That means there are 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 possible arrangements in total.

Now, let's consider the second question. We want to count the arrangements where Susan is not on the left of Tim. There are two possibilities here:
- Susan is on the right of Tim: In this case, we treat Susan and Tim as a single entity (ST), and we have 2 entities to arrange (ST and Zen). There are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange these two entities, which equals 2. However, within ST, Susan and Tim can also switch places, resulting in another arrangement (TS). So, there are actually 2 * 2 = 4 arrangements where Susan is on the right of Tim.
- Susan is in the middle: Here, we have Tim on the left side of Susan (T_S_). There are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange Zen and T_S_, which equals 2. But remember, within T_S_, Susan and Tim can also switch places, resulting in another arrangement (S_T). So, there are actually 2 * 2 = 4 arrangements where Susan is in the middle.

Adding up the two cases, we get a total of 4 + 4 = 8 arrangements where Susan is not on the left of Tim.

Finally, to find the number of ways that satisfy the condition (Susan is on the left of Tim), we subtract the count of unsatisfying arrangements from the total count: 6 (total arrangements) - 8 (unsatisfying arrangements) = -2.

However, since negative numbers don't make sense in this context, the actual answer is 0. There are no valid arrangements where Susan is always on the left of Tim, considering the constraints given in the question.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Input:
Question:There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election?
 Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:a 90% chance, registered voter, Burghtown, last election, five registered voters, randomly chosen, exactly four, likelihood.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting in the last election, given a 90% chance?2. What is the probability of a single randomly chosen registered voter from Burghtown not voting in the last election, if 90% did vote?3. Who are the subjects of interest in this problem - the voters or the selection of five voters? 4. In which town does this scenario take place - Burghtown?5. When is the event being discussed - the last election?6. Why is it important to find the likelihood of exactly four out of five voters voting - for statistical analysis or prediction purposes?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of a statistical analysis and prediction exercise, the last election held in the town of Burghtown serves as the focal point. Given that 90% of the registered voters participated in the election, we can apply the binomial probability formula to determine the probability of specific outcomes. To calculate the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting, we use the formula:P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)where:- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (voters voting) out of n trials (voters),- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also known as "n choose k"),- n = 5 (since there are five voters),- k = 4 (we want to find the probability of four voting),- p = 0.9 (90% chance of a voter voting).Plugging in the values, we get:P(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.9^4 * (1-0.9)^(5-4)P(X = 4) = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1P(X = 4) ≈ 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1P(X = 4) ≈ 0.32805So, the probability of exactly four out of five voters voting is approximately 32.81%.Conversely, to find the probability of a single randomly chosen registered voter not voting, given that 90% voted, we subtract the probability of voting from 1:P(Voter doesn't vote) = 1 - P(Voter votes) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1This means the probability of a single voter not voting is 10%.The subjects of interest in this problem are the voters themselves, as we are calculating probabilities based on their voting behavior. The scenario takes place in the town of Burghtown during the last election. The importance of finding the likelihood of exactly four out of five voters voting lies in understanding the distribution of voter turnout, which can be crucial for statistical analysis and making predictions about future elections.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:voters, 5000, 20% not eligible, two candidates, winning candidate, 15% votes, total number of votes, he got.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many voters are not eligible to vote?2. How many voters are actually eligible to vote?3. What is the difference between the votes received by the winning candidate and the losing candidate?4. If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, how many votes did the losing candidate receive?5. If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, how many votes did the winning candidate receive?6. What is the total number of votes casted in the election?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
1. Calculate the number of voters who are not eligible to vote: 5000 voters * 20% = 1000 voters
2. Calculate the number of eligible voters: 5000 voters - 1000 voters = 4000 voters
3. Determine the difference in votes between the winning candidate and the losing candidate: 15% of the eligible voters
4. Calculate the number of votes received by the losing candidate: 4000 voters * (1 - 15%) = 4000 voters * 0.85 = 3400 votes
5. Calculate the number of votes received by the winning candidate: 3400 votes (losing candidate) + 15% of 4000 voters = 3400 votes + 600 votes = 4000 votes
6. Calculate the total number of votes casted in the election: We already know the total number of eligible voters, which is equal to the total number of votes casted in the election.

In conclusion, the winning candidate received 4000 votes, and the total number of votes casted in the election is also 4000. However, none of the answer choices match our result, so there seems to be an error in the options provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:staircase elevator, coming down, walk 20 steps, stop, reach bottom, 10 minutes, walk 10 steps, stop, reach to the ground, 20 minutes, speed of the elevator..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation determines the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find out the speed of the elevator if you know the number of steps taken and the corresponding time?3. Who is involved in the process of using the elevator (the person walking or the elevator itself)?4. Where does this scenario take place - on a staircase or within an enclosed elevator shaft?5. When does the elevator's speed become relevant - during the initial descent or throughout the entire trip?6. Why is it important to calculate the elevator's speed? (To optimize efficiency, ensure safety, or for maintenance purposes, for example)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The operation that governs the relationship between the number of steps taken and the time it takes to reach the bottom is simple arithmetic, specifically division. To determine the speed of the elevator, one can use the formula: Speed (in steps per second) = Number of Steps / Time (in seconds). This mathematical operation helps in understanding how quickly the elevator moves when given specific data about the steps taken and the corresponding duration.In the process of using the elevator, both the person walking and the elevator itself are involved. The person controls the action by stepping, while the elevator's machinery handles the movement. This scenario typically takes place within an enclosed elevator shaft, which isolates passengers from external factors like stairs.The elevator's speed becomes relevant throughout the entire trip, as it affects the comfort and efficiency of the ride, especially during the initial descent and any stops along the way. Calculating the elevator's speed is crucial for several reasons, such as optimizing energy consumption, ensuring passenger safety by avoiding excessive acceleration or deceleration, and maintaining the elevator's overall performance for effective and reliable operation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:factory, staplers, Monday, defective, non-defective staplers, rejected, 72 staplers, produced that day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced if 72 were rejected, considering 2% of them were rejected by mistake?2. What percentage of the total staplers produced on Monday were non-defective if 72 were rejected, assuming 10% were defective?3. Who or what determines the number of staplers produced on Monday? 4. Where does this scenario take place - at which factory?5. When did the production occur - on which day?6. Why are we interested in finding the total number of staplers produced? Is it related to quality control or factory output?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a manufacturing facility, the quality control process ensures the consistency and reliability of the products. On Monday, the factory aimed to produce a significant quantity of staplers. However, during inspection, it was discovered that 72 staplers were rejected, with an error rate of 2% indicating that the actual defective count was 72 / (1 + 0.02) = 69 staplers. This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday before rejection was 72 + 69 = 141.Of these, 10% were initially identified as defective, so the non-defective staplers made up 90% of the total. To find the percentage of non-defective staplers, we calculate (100% - 10%) * (total before rejection) = 80% * 141 = 112.8%, which is not possible as a percentage. The calculation suggests that there might be a rounding error or a misunderstanding in the data provided.The interest in determining the total number of staplers produced lies in understanding the factory's output and assessing the efficiency of the production line. It's crucial for quality control purposes, as well as for planning future inventory and potential adjustments in production processes.In conclusion, although the exact percentage of non-defective staplers couldn't be determined due to the rounding issue, the scenario took place at an unidentified factory on Monday, where the focus was on ensuring a high-quality product output. The total number of staplers produced before rejection was estimated to be 141, and the situation highlights the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality standards in manufacturing.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:consecutive integers, product, sum, 727+728+729.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How do I identify three consecutive integers when their product is given?2. Can I express the sum of 727, 728, and 729 as a function of those three consecutive integers?3. Who or what determines the three consecutive integers?4. In what kind of problem would the concept of consecutive integers be used?5. How can I calculate the sum of three consecutive integers given their product?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To identify three consecutive integers when their product is given, we need to factorize the product and find factors that differ by 1. For instance, suppose we have the product 6, then its factors could be 1, 2, and 3, which are consecutive integers. We can express the sum of 727, 728, and 729 as a function of those three consecutive integers by recognizing that these numbers are themselves consecutive integers differing by 1. The three consecutive integers must be represented as x, x+1, and x+2. So, we can rewrite the sum as x+(x+1)+(x+2)=3x+3. Therefore, the sum of three consecutive integers is always three times the middle integer plus 3. In this problem, the concept of consecutive integers is being used to represent the given numbers 727, 728, and 729. The factors of the product determine the three consecutive integers. To calculate the sum of three consecutive integers given their product, we first factorize the product and find the factors that differ by 1. Then, we identify the middle integer and multiply it by 3 and add 3 to obtain the sum.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:students, school, more than 501, 20% physics, 28% math, least possible number of students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation can we perform to find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math if we know the percentages of students taking each subject?2. What: How can we combine the given percentages of students taking physics (20%) and math (28%) to find the maximum overlap without exceeding the total count of more than 501 students?3. Who: In this context, what entity is responsible for ensuring that the least possible number of students are accounted for twice (once in physics and once in math)?4. Where: The problem is set in a school, so how does this context affect the calculation of the least possible number of students?5. When: Is there a specific constraint related to the timeframe in which the school's student population could be determined? If not, why does it not matter in this case?6. Why: Why is finding the least possible number of students important in this situation? Does it relate to budgeting, class sizes, or another relevant factor?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario at a school, the mathematics department and physics department conducted a survey to determine student enrollment. To find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math, we need to perform a mathematical operation known as set intersection. By subtracting the percentage of students taking only one subject from the total, we can estimate the overlap. First, let's calculate the percentage of students taking either physics or math or both. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, we add these two percentages together (20% + 28% = 48%). However, since the total number of students cannot exceed 501, the overlap cannot account for more than this number. To avoid double-counting, we must subtract the sum of the percentages from 100% (the entire student population) and then find the intersection within the remaining 52% (100% - 48%).Now, let's assume that the overlap represents the least possible number of students taking both subjects. This implies that these students would not be counted twice in the physics and math counts. Therefore, the school administration, responsible for maintaining accurate records, is the entity ensuring this consistency.The context of the problem being set in a school affects the calculation because it provides the real-world setting where such enrollment data is typically gathered. However, there is no specific timeframe mentioned, and the calculation does not rely on a particular date, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.The importance of finding the least possible number of students taking both subjects lies in efficient resource allocation and planning. It ensures that when allocating budgets for resources like classrooms, instructors, or materials, the school does not overestimate the demand for combined courses, thereby making the allocation more precise and cost-effective.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: students, class, 1/16 math, 1/10 bio, 1/8 english, 4-digit number, difference between max and min number of students.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How do we determine the maximum and minimum number of students in the class?
2. How do we use the given fractions to find the upper and lower bounds for the number of students?
3. What is the significance of the 4-digit number requirement in the problem?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
- To find the maximum number of students, we want to maximize the denominators of the fractions. The largest common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8 is 80. So, the maximum number of students will be a multiple of 80.
- To find the minimum number of students, we want to minimize the denominators of the fractions. We can achieve this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is also 80. So, the minimum number of students will be an integer greater than or equal to 80.
- The 4-digit number requirement means that the maximum number of students should be less than 10,000, but the minimum number should still be greater than or equal to 80.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the number of tempos needed to lift 29400 toys in one round, we must first understand the packing structure. Five dozen toys are packed in a box, and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. By understanding the relationships between these quantities, we can calculate the total number of toys that can be lifted in one round by a single tempo. We can then divide the total number of toys by the number of toys that can be lifted in one round to determine the minimum number of tempos required to lift 29400 toys in one round.

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Question:If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now? Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 41 (C) 40 (D) 42 (E) 43
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Raj, one-third as old as Rahim, 5 years back, Raj is 17 years old now, how old is Rahim now.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between Raj's age and Rahim's age?2. What is Raj's age five years ago?3. Given Raj's age five years ago, what is Rahim's age five years ago?4. How do you calculate the present age of Rahim based on his age five years ago?5. What is the result of applying the appropriate calculations to find the answer?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:According to the question, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim five years ago. So, let's denote Raj's age five years ago as x and Rahim's age five years ago as y. Then we can write the following equation:
x = (1/3)y
Also, the question tells us that Raj is 17 years old now, meaning he has aged 5 years since the reference point. Thus, Raj's age five years ago is 17 - 5 = 12 years old. Substituting this value in the above equation, we get:
12 = (1/3)y
Solving for y, we obtain:
y = 12 * 3 = 36
So, Rahim was 36 years old five years ago. To find out his current age, we add 5 years to his age five years ago:
Current age of Rahim = 36 + 5 = 41 years old.

Question:Let A and B be independent events with P (A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B)?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.2 (B) 0.4 (C) 0.6 (D) 1.2 (E) 1.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, independent events, P(A), P(B), P(A/B).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the conditional probability P(A|B) given that A and B are independent events?2. What is the formula for calculating the probability of an event A occurring given that event B has already occurred, if A and B are independent?3. Who or what determines that P(A/B) can be found using the relationship between independent events?4. In what context would you apply the probabilities P(A) and P(B) when finding P(A|B) for independent events?5. When working with independent events like A and B, why is the probability of both events happening together equal to the product of their individual probabilities?6. How do you compute P(A|B) when given P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8, knowing that they are independent?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In probability theory, when dealing with the conditional probability of an event A occurring given that another event B has occurred, the appropriate operation to use is Bayes' theorem. However, for independent events A and B, a simpler approach applies. The formula for calculating P(A|B) when A and B are independent is based on the fact that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. The conditional probability P(A|B) can be found using the following formula:\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]Here, P(A ∩ B) represents the probability of both events happening together, which, for independent events, is equal to the product of their individual probabilities:\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]Since A and B are independent, we know that:\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(B)} \]\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]Now, let's consider the specific case where P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. For independent events, we directly substitute these values into the simplified formula:\[ P(A|B) = 0.2 \]So, when given the probabilities of two independent events, the conditional probability P(A|B) can be computed by multiplying their individual probabilities without any further calculations, as the dependency between them is null. This concept is useful in various contexts, such as statistics, gambling, or decision-making scenarios where the likelihood of one event does not influence the likelihood of another.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A computer routine, two numbers (x, y), first number, random number, 0 and 100, inclusive, second number, less than or equal to the square root of the first, pair, satisfies the routine, exception..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the routine require for the second number?2. What is the condition that defines a valid pair according to the routine?3. Who might have created this computer routine for generating such numbers?4. In what context would this routine be used, such as a simulation or a statistical experiment?5. When might a pair fail to satisfy the routine, and why does it matter?6. How can one verify if a given pair (x, y) follows the condition of the routine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The computer routine in question employs a mathematical operation involving subtraction for the second number. It defines a valid pair as one where the difference between x and y, denoted as |x - y|, is less than or equal to 10. This unique routine was likely crafted by an individual with expertise in mathematics or computer science, possibly for applications in simulations or statistical experiments where small, controlled variations are essential.In a simulation, for instance, it could be used to model random fluctuations within a predefined range, ensuring realistic outcomes. In a statistical experiment, it might be employed to generate paired data samples with limited dispersion. A pair fails to satisfy the routine when the absolute difference between x and y exceeds 10; this matters because it deviates from the intended constraint, potentially altering the nature of the data or violating the assumptions of the analysis.To verify if a given pair (x, y) adheres to the routine, one simply calculates the absolute difference |x - y| and checks if it is less than or equal to 10. If the condition holds true, the pair is considered valid according to the provided routine.

Question:The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 0.6 (C) 0.7 (D) 0.8 (E) 0.9
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:events A and B, independent, probability that event A occurs, 0.6, probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs, 0.96, probability that event B occurs.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the probability of event B occurring given that A and B are independent?2. What is the relationship between the probabilities of A and B when they are independent?3. Who or what determines the probability of at least one of A or B happening?4. In which context does the independence of events A and B play a role in calculating the probability of B?5. When calculating the probability of B, what information about A's occurrence is already known?6. How can we use the given probabilities (0.6 and 0.96) to find the probability of B occurring?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:When dealing with probabilities, the concept of independence is crucial for understanding certain calculations. Given two events, A and B, if they are independent, this means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring. To find the probability of event B happening specifically when A has occurred and they are independent, we use the multiplication rule of probability. The formula for this is P(B|A) = P(B), where P(B|A) represents the conditional probability of B given A, and P(B) is the probability of B alone.The relationship between the probabilities of A and B when they are independent is that their joint probability, P(A ∩ B), equals the product of their individual probabilities, P(A) * P(B). This is expressed as P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) / P(A).The probability of at least one of A or B happening, denoted as P(A ∪ B), is determined by adding the probabilities of A and B, minus their intersection (since they cannot both happen at the same time): P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).Independence of events A and B plays a role in calculating the probability of B in situations where we want to know the likelihood of B occurring without considering the occurrence of A. If A and B are independent, we can directly use P(B) to find the probability of B.In the context of calculating the probability of B, if we know that A and B are independent, and we have the probabilities P(A) and P(B), we can simply use P(B) to find the probability of B without needing any additional information about A's occurrence.To find the probability of B using the given probabilities of 0.6 for A and 0.96 for B, since they are independent, we can directly apply P(B) = 0.96, as the occurrence of A does not affect B's probability. Therefore, the probability of B occurring is 0.96.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:relatively prime, two numbers, common positive factors, 1, set S, integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive, probability, number chosen from S, relatively prime to 1,000.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the definition of "relatively prime"?2. Can two numbers be relatively prime even if they share some negative factors?3. Is it necessary for the numbers to be consecutive for them to be relatively prime?4. How many positive integers less than or equal to 1,000 are relatively prime to 1,000?5. What is the total number of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive?6. How can we calculate the probability of choosing a number from set S that is relatively prime to 1,000?7. What is the significance of having no common positive factors other than 1 in the context of relative primality?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:"Relatively prime" refers to two numbers that have no non-trivial common factors. In other words, the only factor they share is 1. No, two numbers can still be relatively prime even if they share some negative factors, but those factors must not be positive. Relatively prime numbers need not be consecutive; they can be separated by any number of integers. To determine how many positive integers less than or equal to 1,000 are relatively prime to 1,000, we can use the totient function (also called Euler's phi function), which counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. In this case, the totient of 1,000 is 400. The total number of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive, is 1,000. To calculate the probability of choosing a number from set S that is relatively prime to 1,000, we divide the number of relatively prime integers by the total number of integers in set S: P(number is relatively prime to 1,000) = 400 / 1,000 = 2 / 5. Having no common positive factors other than 1 ensures that the numbers are coprime, meaning they have no shared divisors other than 1. This property is important in number theory, cryptography, and various mathematical applications.

 Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the squares of two numbers, difference, 256000, sum of the numbers, 1000, numbers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the squares of the two numbers?2. What is the mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the squares and their difference being 256000?3. How can we set up an algebraic expression to solve for the two numbers if their sum is 1000?4. Who are the unknown variables in this problem, and what constraints do they have based on the given information?5. In what type of situation or context does this problem arise, such as geometry or algebra?6. Given that the sum is 1000, why is it not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers without additional information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In solving problems involving squares and sums, algebra plays a crucial role. To find the squares of two numbers, you would typically use the multiplication operation, squaring each number individually. For example, if x and y are the unknown numbers, their squares would be represented as x^2 and y^2.To represent the relationship where the squares of the two numbers differ by 256000, the mathematical equation would be:(x^2 - y^2) = 256000This equation comes from the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to (x + y)(x - y). Since the difference is given, we can deduce that (x + y) and (x - y) are factors of 256000.Now, if the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can set up an algebraic expression using the variable constraint. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y, so x + y = 1000. To solve for the two numbers, we would typically use substitution or elimination methods in algebra.The unknown variables in this problem are x and y, and they are constrained by the sum condition x + y = 1000. This problem falls under the category of algebra, specifically linear equations, since the relationship between the variables is linear.However, without additional information about the relationship between the squares or differences, it is not possible to uniquely determine the two numbers. For instance, if we only knew the sum and the squares' difference, there would be multiple pairs of numbers (like 500 and 500 or 998 and 2) that could satisfy these conditions. Thus, extra data is needed to break the ambiguity.

 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

 Answer Choices: (A) 820 (B) 202 (C) 420 (D) 209 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:consecutive two-digit odd numbers, sum, divided by 10, perfect square.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the general rule for identifying consecutive odd numbers?2. How many two-digit odd numbers exist?3. How can we ensure that the sum of five consecutive odd numbers is divisible by 10?4. What is the connection between the divisibility of the sum by 10 and it becoming a perfect square?5. Can we use algebra to identify potential candidates for the five consecutive odd numbers?6. Why is it important to consider the remainder when dividing by 10?7. What is the maximum possible value for the sum of five consecutive odd numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Consecutive odd numbers are generated by adding a fixed even number to the previous odd number. For example, the first odd number is 1, and the second odd number is 1 + 2 = 3. Similarly, the third odd number is 3 + 2 = 5, and so on. Two-digit odd numbers range from 11 to 99, inclusive. To guarantee that the sum of five consecutive odd numbers is divisible by 10, we must ensure that the last digit of each odd number is either 5 or 0. This is because any number ending with 5 or 0 will yield a zero remainder when divided by 10. Moreover, for the sum to become a perfect square, it implies that the original sum is a multiple of 10 and also ends with 0. We can use algebra to express the five consecutive odd numbers as follows: x-4, x-2, x, x+2, and x+4, where x is the middle odd number. The sum of these five numbers can be expressed as 5x. We need to find the values of x that make 5x divisible by 10 and end with 0. It's essential to consider the remainder when dividing by 10 because it affects whether the resulting sum will be a perfect square. The maximum possible value for the sum of five consecutive odd numbers is 99 + 97 + 95 + 93 + 91 = 475, which is not divisible by 10.

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 60 (C) 70 (D) 80 (E) 90
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: present age of Ajay, subtract 6 years, remainder divided by 18, present age of Rahul, 2 years younger to Denis, Denis's age is 5 years.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the relationship between Ajay's age and Rahul's age? 2. How do we obtain Rahul's age from Ajay's age? 3. What is the age difference between Rahul and Denis? 4. Given Denis's age, how can we determine the value of Ajay's age?

From the problem statement, we can deduce the following relationships:
- Ajay's age minus 6 years gives a multiple of 18, which equals Rahul's age.
- Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old.

Now, let's analyze these relationships to find Ajay's age:

1. We already know the relationship between Ajay's age and Rahul's age, which is stated in the problem statement.
2. To obtain Rahul's age from Ajay's age, we need to subtract 6 years from Ajay's age and divide the result by 18.
3. We know that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old. So, Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years.
4. To find Ajay's age, we need to reverse the process mentioned in step 2. First, multiply Rahul's age by 18, then add 6 years to get Ajay's age.

Since Rahul is 3 years old, we can plug that value into the calculations:

Ajay's age = (Rahul's age × 18) + 6
= (3 × 18) + 6
= 54 + 6
= 60

Therefore, Ajay's present age is 60 years.

Hence, the correct answer is choice (B): 60.

Input:
Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 160 (C) 150 (D) 210 (E) 220
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:sum, subtracted, 2/3 of a number, 10, result, equal, sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of "subtracted" in the context of the question?2. What does "result" refer to in the question?3. What is meant by "sum" in the question?4. How can we use the information given in the question to form an equation and solve for the unknown number?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage:According to the question, if we take 2/3 of a number and subtract 10 from it, the outcome will be equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Our goal is to find the value of this number.

We can start by assigning a variable 'x' to represent the unknown number. Next, we can express the different components of the question using algebraic expressions:
- 2/3 of the number: (2/3)x
- 10 subtracted from 2/3 of the number: (2/3)x - 10
- Sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number: 40 + (1/3)x

Now, we can create an equation based on the given information:

(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x

Our task is to solve this equation for the variable 'x'.

First, let's eliminate the term with (1/3)x from the right-hand side of the equation by subtracting (1/3)x from both sides:

(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40

Simplifying the left-hand side:

(1/3)x - 10 = 40

Next, isolate (1/3)x by adding 10 to both sides:

(1/3)x = 50

Finally, solve for x by multiplying both sides by 3:

x = 50 * 3

x = 150

So, the unknown number is 150.

Input:
Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In how many ways can the letters of the word "PROBLEC" be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat?

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:the letters of the word "PROBLEC", rearranged, 7 letter words, none of the letters repeat.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of arrangements possible when all the letters of a word are considered without repetition?2. What is the factorial notation used to calculate the number of permutations when arranging a set of distinct elements, like the letters in "PROBLEC"?3. In the context of the word "PROBLEC," how many unique letters does it have that can be rearranged to form 7-letter words?4. How does the concept of factorial apply to determining the number of ways the letters in "PROBLEC" can be arranged to create 7-letter words with no repeats?5. Who would typically perform this calculation, a mathematician, a computer programmer, or someone solving a puzzle?6. Where might you encounter this type of problem, in combinatorics, probability, or a word game like Scrabble?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the realm of combinatorics, the operation that represents the total number of arrangements possible when all the letters of a word are considered without repetition is known as permutations. This is calculated using the factorial notation, which is denoted by an exclamation mark (!). For instance, to find the permutations of the distinct elements in the word "PROBLEC," we would use the formula n! where n is the number of elements. In the case of "PROBLEC," there are 7 unique letters (P, R, O, B, L, E, and C), so the factorial for 7 letters, 7!, would give us the number of permutations.When arranging the letters in "PROBLEC" to form 7-letter words with no repeats, the factorial calculation comes into play. The number of permutations would be 7! because each letter can be placed in any of the 7 positions without repetition. To find the exact number, we multiply 7 by 6 by 5 by 4 by 3 by 2 by 1, which equals 5,040.This type of calculation is commonly performed by mathematicians and computer programmers who need to determine the combinations or permutations in various scenarios, such as data analysis, cryptography, or even in word games like Scrabble, where players need to know how many unique words they can make with a given set of letters. In essence, understanding factorials is crucial for tackling problems in combinatorics and probability.

Question:John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, 3-letter codes, 5 vowels, 20 consonants, middle letter must be vowel, first and third letters different consonants.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many different ways can John choose the first consonant?2. How many different ways can John choose the middle vowel?3. How many different ways can John choose the third consonant, ensuring it is different from the first consonant?4. How do we combine the number of possibilities for the first consonant, middle vowel, and third consonant to determine the total number of codes?5. Which answer choice (A) 1,980, (B) 2,020, (C) 2,100, (D) 2,200, or (E) 1,900 best represents the total number of codes John can create under the given conditions?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of codes John can create, we need to calculate the number of ways he can choose each of the three letters based on the specified conditions. We'll start with the first consonant:1. There are 20 consonants available for John to choose from, so he has 20 options for the first consonant.2. Once the first consonant is chosen, there are 5 vowels remaining for him to pick from, so he has 5 options for the middle vowel.3. Now, we need to ensure that the third consonant is different from the first consonant. Since there are 20 consonants overall and one has already been selected, there are 19 consonants left for John to choose from. However, we also need to subtract those consonants that are the same as the first consonant, which leaves us with 18 consonants for the third position. Therefore, he has 18 options for the third consonant.To find the total number of codes, we multiply the number of options for each position together:20 (first consonant) × 5 (middle vowel) × 18 (third consonant) = 1,800 codesHowever, the given answer choices don't include 1,800. It appears there may be an error in the answer choices provided. Based on the information given in the question, the correct answer should be 1,800 codes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not present.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:25/12, 5, equals.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the decimal representation of 25/12?2. How does multiplying 25/12 by 5 change the decimal value?3. Among the answer choices, which option matches the calculated result?4. Are there any mathematical shortcuts or tricks to calculate 25/12 * 5 more efficiently?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When calculating 25/12 * 5, it's crucial to convert the mixed fraction 25/12 to a decimal first. Once we have the decimal representation, we can multiply it by 5 to obtain the desired result. After finding the product, we will compare our answer to the available options to select the correct one.Let's begin by converting 25/12 to a decimal:

25 ÷ 12 = 2 remainder 1
25 = 12 * 2 + 1
1 ÷ 12 = 0.0833 recurring

Since the decimal is repeating, we can express it as 2.0833 recurring (or 2.08333...).

Next, we'll multiply this decimal by 5:

2.08333... * 5 = 10.41666...

Question:If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 < x < 54 (B) 23 < x < 58 (C) 25 < x < 64 (D) 28 < x < 60 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:n, 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x, n^2, 2√n(n + 4), 16, n + 4√n + 4.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation(s) does x represent in the equation?2. How does the quadratic expression (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) relate to x's formation?3. What type of simplification or algebraic manipulation is needed to evaluate x?4. Given the range 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, how does it affect the values of x?5. In what interval does the denominator (n + 4√n + 4) contribute to the range of x?6. Which answer choice best describes the range of x for the given conditions on n?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The equation we are dealing with is not explicitly provided, but let's assume that it involves a variable x that is derived from a quadratic expression. In the quadratic expression \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \), we can recognize that this is likely the expanded form of a square trinomial, since the constant term (16) is the square of 4. This suggests that \( x \) might be formed by completing the square or factoring the expression.To evaluate \( x \), we would need to simplify the expression by grouping terms and factoring out perfect squares, if possible. If \( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) \) can be rewritten as \( (n + something)^2 \), then \( x \) would be the result of this transformation.Given the range for \( n \) from 36 to 72, this affects the values of \( x \) because the square root term (\( \sqrt{n} \)) is within the bounds of the range, so \( x \) will vary as \( n \) does within that interval. However, without knowing the exact relationship between \( x \) and \( n \), we cannot determine the exact impact on \( x \).The denominator in the expression, \( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \), contributes to the range of \( x \) by potentially causing division by zero issues if there are any values of \( n \) within the interval where this expression equals zero. To find the interval where this occurs, we would set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( n \), which would involve finding the roots of a quadratic equation.In conclusion, to describe the range of \( x \) for the given conditions on \( n \) (36 ≤ n ≤ 72), we need to first simplify the quadratic expression, possibly completing the square, and then analyze how the range of \( n \) affects the possible values of \( x \), accounting for any potential restrictions from the denominator. The answer choice that best describes the range of \( x \) would depend on the specific algebraic manipulation and the nature of the simplified expression. Without the actual equation, we cannot provide an exact numerical range, but the process described above outlines the steps necessary to determine it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Question:A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
 Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:student, value of 7/8 of a number, value of 7/18 of the number, answer, actual one, difference, 770, number..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the student perform incorrectly: finding the value of 7/8 or 7/18?2. What is the relationship between the two fractions (7/8 and 7/18) that the student should have used?3. Who is affected by the incorrect calculation - the student or the person who checks their answer?4. Where does the error occur in the student's thought process or calculation?5. When did the student make this mistake - during the calculation or after?6. Why does the difference between the two answers equal 770? (This pertains to the concept of proportion or algebraic reasoning.)
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The student performed an incorrect operation when they attempted to compare the values of 7/8 and 7/18 instead of finding a common ground for comparison. The relationship between the two fractions is that they both have the same numerator, 7, which indicates that their values are directly proportional to their respective denominators. The correct approach would be to recognize that the error lies in assuming the fractions were equal without considering that 8 is divisible by 18, making 7/8 a larger fraction.The incorrect calculation affects the person who checks the student's answer, as they would interpret the comparison as if it were accurate. The error occurs in the student's thought process, where they failed to recognize the need for simplification or proportionality. To see why the difference equals 770, we can set up the equation (7/8 - 7/18) * total quantity = 770. Using algebraic reasoning, we find that the common denominator is 72, and the simplified expression becomes (9 * 7 - 8 * 7) / 72. This simplifies to (63 - 56) / 72, which equals 7/72. Since the total quantity is not given, we can't calculate the exact number, but the concept involves recognizing that the difference in the reduced form represents 770 times the common denominator or another related factor.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Suppose you want to arrange your English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography and Science books on a shelf. In how many ways can you do it ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 520 (B) 720 (C) 920 (D) None (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:arrange, English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, Science books, shelf, ways..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of arrangements in this problem?2. How many distinct books are there that need to be arranged?3. In how many ways can you arrange the first book (e.g., English)?4. Given that the second book can be any of the remaining, how many choices do you have for placing the Hindi book?5. What is the general term for the number of permutations when arranging n items without regard to order?6. Can you determine the answer without knowing the exact number of ways for each book's position? If not, why not?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of arrangements in the given problem, we can apply the concept of permutations, which is a mathematical operation used to determine the number of ways n items can be arranged. Let's denote the number of distinct books as B.1. The operation used for this calculation is permutation, represented by the formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where "!" denotes factorial, which means multiplying all positive integers up to that number.2. There are B distinct books that need to be arranged.3. For the first book, since it has no restrictions, there are B choices for its position.4. Once the first book is placed, there are (B-1) choices left for the second book, as it can be any of the remaining books.5. The general term for the number of permutations when arranging n items without regard to order is indeed P(n, n) = n!, as each item can go in any of the n positions.6. Yes, we can determine the answer without knowing the exact number of ways for each book's position because the final result will only depend on the total number of distinct books (B). We can multiply the number of choices for the first book by the number of choices for the second book, and so on, until all books are accounted for, resulting in B * (B-1) * ... * 1, which simplifies to B!.Therefore, the passage describing the calculations would be:To find the total number of arrangements, we apply the permutation formula P(B, B) = B! where B is the number of distinct books. First, there are B choices for placing the first book. Since the second book can be any of the remaining (B-1) books, we multiply these choices together: B * (B-1). This gives us the total number of distinct arrangements, which simplifies to B! arrangements when considering all books without regard to their specific order.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Amy, organizing bookshelves, 10 different types of books, codes, single letter, pair of two different letters, smallest number of letters..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of unique single letters Amy can use to code her 10 books if each type gets only one code?2. How many different pairs of two letters can be formed using the available letters for Amy's coding system?3. Considering both single-letter and pair-of-two-letter codes, how many distinct combinations can Amy create with a limited number of letters?4. Assuming no repetition of letters, how many additional letters would Amy need beyond the first set of single letters to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs?5. Given that order does not matter in pairs, how many unique pairs can be formed from a set of n single letters where n is the total number of letters Amy has?6. Which answer choice (A) 3, (B) 4, (C) 5, (D) 10, or (E) 20 best represents the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Amy is tasked with coding her 10 books using a limited number of unique single letters and pairs of two letters. To find the minimum number of single letters needed, she realizes that each book requires a distinct code. Since there are 10 books and each gets one code, she needs at least 10 unique single letters (answer 1). Next, she calculates the number of different pairs that can be formed from these 10 single letters. The formula for combinations when order doesn't matter is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time. In this case, n=10 and k=2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45 pairs (answer 2).To find the total distinct combinations considering both single letters and pairs, we add the number of single letter codes (10) to the number of pair codes (45), which equals 55 combinations (answer 3).For Amy to accommodate all 10 book types with unique pairs without repeating single letters, she would need more than just the initial set of 10 single letters. Let's say she uses m additional letters for pairs. Each pair uses two letters, so she needs (m * (m - 1)) / 2 pairs. Adding these to the initial 10 single letters, we have 10 + (m * (m - 1) / 2) = 10. Solving for m, we find that m = 4 (answer 4). This means she needs 4 additional letters.Finally, to determine the smallest number of letters needed for unique pairs from a set of n letters, we need to consider the combinations of choosing 2 letters out of n. Using the combination formula again, C(n, 2), we calculate C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!), where n is the total number of letters. For this question, n is the sum of the initial 10 single letters and the 4 additional letters, which equals 14. Plugging n=14 into the formula, we get C(14, 2) = 91 unique pairs (answer 5).Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create codes for all 10 book types is the sum of the initial set (10) and the additional letters needed for pairs (4), which equals 14 letters (answer 6). The passage detailing these calculations is as follows:Amy codes her 10 books using a combination of single letters and pairs. With 10 books needing unique codes, she initially requires 10 single letters (answer 1). She forms 45 pairs from these letters (answer 2), making the total distinct combinations 55. To accommodate all book types with unique pairs, she needs 4 more letters (answer 4), bringing the total to 14 letters. From these 14 letters, she can create 91 unique pairs (answer 5), and the smallest number of letters needed is 14 (answer 6).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 18 (D) 20 (E) 30
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:bookshelf, 45 books, 30 hardcover, 20 fiction, maximum number, both hardcover and fiction.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Is there enough information to determine the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction?2. Are the categories hardcover and fiction mutually exclusive?3. How many books are neither hardcover nor fiction?4. Can we determine the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction based on the number of books that belong to each category individually?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:1. Yes, there is enough information to determine the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.2. No, the categories hardcover and fiction are not mutually exclusive, meaning a book can be both hardcover and fiction.3. To find the number of books that are neither hardcover nor fiction, we can subtract the number of hardcover and fiction books from the total number of books: 45 - 30 - 20 = -5. However, this result indicates that our calculation is incorrect, as it cannot be negative. The error is due to double-counting some books that are both hardcover and fiction.4. Based on the individual counts of hardcover and fiction books, we know that there are at most 30 hardcover books and at most 20 fiction books. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is the smaller of these two quantities, which is 20.Books can be categorized into four groups: hardcover and fiction, hardcover but not fiction, fiction but not hardcover, and neither hardcover nor fiction. To determine the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we should first understand that a book can belong to multiple categories simultaneously. Thus, the categories are not mutually exclusive, meaning a book can be both hardcover and fiction.

The passage explaining the reasoning behind the answer could be:Upon examining the given information about the bookshelf containing 45 books, we observe that the categories of hardcover and fiction are not mutually exclusive, meaning a book can be both hardcover and fiction. Therefore, to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to compare the number of hardcover books (30) and the number of fiction books (20). Since a book can be both hardcover and fiction, the maximum number of such books is the smaller of these two quantities, which is 20. This means that there are at most 20 books on the bookshelf that are both hardcover and fiction.

Question:Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
 Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Q, R, T, the sum of the ages of R and T, difference between R and Q's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the difference between R and Q's age?2. What is the relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T?3. Who are the two individuals whose age difference we need to determine?4. Where does the sum of R and T's ages play a role in this problem?5. When is the provided information about the sum of ages relevant for calculating the difference?6. Why is it not possible to determine the exact difference without more information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the difference between R and Q's age, you would subtract Q's age from R's age, using the operation of subtraction (R - Q). The relationship between Q's age and the ages of R and T is that their combined ages, which is represented by the sum (R + T), plays a role in establishing a connection. Specifically, if you know the sum of R and T's ages and the individual age of Q, you can use the formula (R + T) - 2Q to find out the combined age difference between R and T. However, without additional information, such as specific values for R, T, and Q, it is not possible to calculate the exact difference between R and Q since there are two unknowns in the equation. The given information about the sum of ages is relevant when attempting to solve for the difference under the assumption that R and T have an equal age difference from Q, which might be true in certain scenarios. In other cases, more data would be necessary to pinpoint the exact age difference.

Question:In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
 Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:IPL season, Sachin, current batting average, 51, finals, scores 78 runs, batting average, 54, total number of matches played..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out Sachin's new batting average after scoring 78 runs?2. What is the formula for calculating a player's batting average if we know their initial average and the number of runs scored?3. Who is the subject of the batting average calculation in this scenario (Sachin)?4. Where does the change in batting average occur - in the IPL season or specifically during the finals?5. When does the change in batting average happen - after scoring 78 runs or at the end of the season?6. How many matches did Sachin play before the finals to have a current average of 51 runs?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of Sachin's cricketing journey, his batting average is a crucial statistic that reflects his performance. To determine his new average after scoring an impressive 78 runs, we can use the batting average formula. The formula is:\[ \text{New Average} = \frac{\text{Initial Average} \times \text{Matches Played} + \text{Runs Scored}}{\text{Matches Played} + 1} \]Let's assume Sachin had a current average of 51 runs before the additional match. If he played \( M \) matches prior to the finals, the calculation would look like this:\[ \text{Initial Average} = 51 \]\[ \text{Runs Scored} = 78 \]\[ \text{Matches Played Before Finals} = M \]After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his new average \( \text{NewAvg} \) would be:\[ \text{NewAvg} = \frac{51M + 78}{M + 1} \]The specific change in batting average occurs during the finals, as it's after scoring those 78 runs. To find out how many matches \( M \) Sachin played before the finals to have a current average of 51, we would need to know the total runs scored before the finals. Unfortunately, without this information, we cannot directly calculate \( M \). However, once we have \( M \), we can plug it into the formula above to find his new average.

 Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:age, 2 years old, brother, half my age, now, 60 years old, brother's age.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the relationship between your ages when you were 2 years old?2. What mathematical operation can be used to find your brother's age at that time, given he was half your age?3. Who was half the age of the other person in the scenario?4. In what context does the problem take place, regarding your current ages?5. When did the age difference between you and your brother become relevant to determine his current age?6. How much older are you now compared to when you were 2 years old, which will help find your brother's current age?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When we were both just 2 years old, the relationship between our ages was represented by simple addition, as you were only twice as old as I was. To find your brother's age at that time, I would subtract one half of your age from your total age. Since you were 2 years old, your brother's age would have been 2 - (1/2 * 2) = 1 year old.At that moment, your brother was half the age of you, which means he was half the 2-year-old version of yourself. As for the context, this situation takes place in our childhood, specifically when we were both very young.The age difference between us became relevant to determine your brother's current age when we started comparing our ages more precisely, likely around the time I turned 20 or so, assuming you're a bit younger than me. To find your brother's current age, we can calculate it by adding the difference in our ages since we were 2. If I am currently X years old and you're Y years old, then your brother's current age (B) would be X - 2 (your age at 2) + (Y - 2) (your brother's age at 2).Now, if you were 2 years younger than me, and I am Z years older than you now, the calculation for your current age (Y) would be Z - 2, and your brother's age (B) would be Z - 4. Therefore, my current age is Z, and your brother's current age is Z - 2, making him 2 years younger than me.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 25 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 21
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Ages of Sachin and Ajay, 10 years ago, future age of Sachin, present age of Ajay.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How do we describe the relationship between Sachin and Ajay's ages 10 years ago?2. What mathematical operations should be performed to determine Ajay's current age?3. What is the significance of Sachin being 40 years old in 10 years in relation to Ajay's age?4. How do we account for the passage of time in the given information to accurately calculate Ajay's age?5. Is there any additional information that may help us narrow down the options or confirm the correct choice?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Ten years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay, meaning that their ages were related by a factor of 2. This can be expressed as \( S_{-10} = 2A_{-10} \), where \( S_{-10} \) denotes Sachin's age 10 years ago and \( A_{-10} \) denotes Ajay's age 10 years ago. We also know that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, meaning that his current age is 30 years. Using this information, we can create an expression for Ajay's current age based on the age relationship from ten years ago: \( A_0 = \frac{S_{-10}}{2} + 10 \). This expression tells us that Ajay's current age is equal to half of Sachin's age 10 years ago plus 10 years. Plugging in the known value for Sachin's age 10 years ago, we get \( A_0 = \frac{30 - 10}{2} + 10 = 20 \).

Question:In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row?
 Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:row of children, Neha, 12th from left end, Radha, 6th from right end, shifted left by 2 places, shifted right by 2 places, 6 children between, Radha and Neha.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the problem involve to find out the initial positions of Neha and Radha relative to each other?2. What calculation is needed to determine the new position of Radha after shifting left by 2 places?3. How many places are there between Radha's initial position and her new position?4. Which operation should be used to find out the new position of Neha after shifting right by 2 places?5. How many places are there between Neha's initial position and her new position?6. How many children will be there between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, given the specified condition?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Neha and Radha initially positioned themselves on a number line for a game. To find their relative positions, we need to perform an arithmetic operation. Let's assume Neha is at position 'N' and Radha is at position 'R'. The problem doesn't provide specific values for N and R, but to determine their positions relative to each other, we would subtract Radha's position from Neha's: N - R.For Radha's movement, she shifts left by 2 places. Her new position would be R - 2. This involves a subtraction operation.The distance between Radha's initial and new positions can be calculated by subtracting her new position from her initial one: |R - (R - 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places.Now, let's consider Neha's shift. She moves right by 2 places, so her new position would be N + 2. Again, an addition operation is involved.The distance between Neha's initial and new positions is similarly calculated: |N - (N + 2)|, which simplifies to 2 places as well.Finally, to determine the number of children between Radha's new position and Neha's new position, we would subtract Radha's new position from Neha's new position, given that the children are evenly spaced and there are no gaps: |(N + 2) - (R - 2)|. Since we don't have specific values for N and R, we cannot calculate an exact number, but this formula represents the calculation needed.In summary, to find the initial positions relative to each other, we subtract Radha's position from Neha's; for Radha's new position, it's a left shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions is 2; for Neha's new position, it's a right shift of 2 places; the distance between their positions remains 2; and the number of children between them depends on their specific positions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 84 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:travel from M to Q, 3 buses, place M, place N, 4 buses, place O, 1 bus, place P, 3 buses.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do you need to perform to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q?2. How many different combinations can you form by taking 3 buses from place M to place N?3. What is the total number of ways to travel from place N to place O using 4 buses?4. Once you reach place O, how many choices do you have for the next bus that goes to place P?5. After arriving at place P, how many ways are there to complete the journey with 3 buses to reach place Q?6. To find the overall number of ways from M to Q, what do you need to multiply together: the number of ways from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we need to consider the independent steps involved in the journey. First, let's break it down:1. To find the total number of ways to travel from M to N, since there are multiple buses available, we assume each bus has a unique route. If there are B1 buses between M and N, then the number of ways to choose 3 buses for this leg is C(B1, 3), which is the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of buses (B1) and k is the number of buses chosen (3).2. Once at N, there are B2 buses to choose from for the trip to O. The number of ways to do this is C(B2, 4), as we need to select 4 buses.3. Upon reaching O, there are B3 buses for the journey to P, and the number of ways is C(B3, 1), since we only need one bus.4. At P, for the final leg to Q, there are B4 buses, and the choice is C(B4, 3) again, as we take 3 buses.Now, to find the overall number of ways from M to Q, we multiply the number of ways for each step together:Total ways = C(B1, 3) * C(B2, 4) * C(B3, 1) * C(B4, 3)This product gives us the total number of unique combinations to travel from M to Q. Note that each combination represents a distinct sequence of buses along the entire route.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
 Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:total no. of distinct bike no.'s, 2 letters, 2 no.'s, distinct letters.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total number of distinct bike numbers?2. How many factors does the formation of a bike number with 2 letters and 2 numbers involve?3. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations if there are 2 distinct letters available?4. In how many ways can you arrange 2 unique letters for the bike number?5. How does the presence of distinct letters affect the total count of possible bike numbers?6. What is the product of the number of choices for the first letter and the second letter, given they must be distinct?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to consider the different components that make up a bike number. A bike number typically consists of two letters followed by two numbers. Let's break it down:1. For the letters, since they are distinct, we have 26 choices for the first letter (assuming the alphabet is from A to Z) and 25 choices left for the second letter (as we can't repeat the first letter). The multiplication principle applies here, so the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25\).2. For the numbers, each position has 10 choices (from 0 to 9). Since there are two positions, the number of factors in the formation of a bike number with two numbers is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).3. The mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations when there are n unique items taken m at a time, without regard to order, is the combination formula: \(_nC_m = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\). If we have 2 distinct letters (\(n = 2\)) and we want to choose 2 (\(m = 2\)), the formula gives us \(_2C_2 = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\) combination.4. Arranging the 2 unique letters for the bike number is simply a permutation problem. The number of permutations for \(n\) objects taken all at a time is \(n!\), so for 2 letters, \(2!\) = 2.5. The presence of distinct letters adds to the total count because each letter choice is independent, and we multiply the counts. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers considering both letters and numbers is the product of the letter combinations and the number combinations: \(26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 10\).6. To find the product of the number of choices for the first and second letter, we multiply them: \(26 \times 25\).Combining these calculations into a passage:The formation of a bike number involves two distinct letters and two numbers. With 26 choices for the first letter and 25 for the second due to their distinctness, the total number of distinct letter combinations is \(26 \times 25 = 650\). Each of the two number positions offers 10 choices, resulting in \(10 \times 10 = 100\) factors for the number part. When calculating combinations with distinct letters, there's only one way to select both (\(_2C_2 = 1\)). The arrangement of the two unique letters forms \(2!\) permutations, which equals 2.The presence of distinct letters affects the total count by multiplying these separate components: \(650\) (letters) multiplied by \(100\) (numbers) gives us the total number of distinct bike numbers, which is \(650 \times 100 = 65,000\). The product of the choices for the first and second letter is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:My wall contains 8 red colour ties, 13 violet colour ties,10 blue colour ties, 5 pink colour ties, 4 green colour ties. If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:wall, 8 red ties, 13 violet ties, 10 blue ties, 5 pink ties, 4 green ties, electricity gone, at least two ties of same color, how many ties to take out.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the minimum number of ties required to ensure that there are at least two ties of the same color?2. How many ties are there in total on the wall?3. Is it necessary to take out more than the minimum number of ties to satisfy the condition?4. Can we guarantee that there will always be two ties of the same color if we take out the minimum number of ties?5. How many ties should be removed from the rack to meet the condition, considering the worst-case scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the minimum number of ties required to ensure that there are at least two ties of the same color, we can analyze the situation based on the number of colors present. There are five colors (red, violet, blue, pink, and green), and we know that we have at least one tie of each color. Therefore, if we remove just one tie from each color, we will still not have any pairs of ties with the same color. We need to remove one additional tie to create a pair of ties with the same color.

Now, let's calculate the total number of ties on the wall:8 red ties + 13 violet ties + 10 blue ties + 5 pink ties + 4 green ties = 39 ties

It's not necessary to take out more than the minimum number of ties to satisfy the condition, as removing one additional tie from any color guarantees that there will be at least two ties of the same color.

Yes, we can guarantee that there will always be two ties of the same color if we take out the minimum number of ties, as removing one additional tie from any color creates a pair.

Considering the worst-case scenario, we have already established that removing one additional tie from any color guarantees that there will be at least two ties of the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of ties that should be removed from the rack to meet the condition is 6.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Question:20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:marbles, pulled out, white marbles, painted black, 20 marbles, 1 black marble, percentage, second time, represents, percentage in the bag, total Q, bag..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find out the initial number of black marbles in the bag before any were painted?2. How many white marbles were originally in the bag if 20 were later painted black?3. What mathematical operation can be used to find the total number of marbles that were initially in the bag?4. What percentage of the original marbles was represented by the 1 black marble drawn the second time?5. How many marbles were returned to the bag after the first batch of 20 was pulled out?6. Using the information about the second draw, what algebraic manipulation would you apply to determine the current number of black marbles in the bag?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To begin, let's denote the initial number of black marbles as B and the number of white marbles as W. According to the given information, we know that one black marble was added for every two white marbles that were painted black. If 20 white marbles were painted black, this implies that there were initially (20/2) = 10 black marbles (since each pair of white marbles resulted in one additional black).The total number of marbles initially in the bag, including both black and white, can be found by adding B and W. Since we know there were 10 black marbles and no other information about the white marbles, we'll call this sum T, where T = B + W.For the second draw, if 1 black marble was drawn out of the bag and returned, the percentage of the original marbles it represented can be calculated using the formula: (number of black marbles / total original marbles) * 100%. Since we now have 11 black marbles (10 original plus 1 added), the percentage is (11/T) * 100%.After the first batch of 20 marbles was pulled out, they were all returned, so the number of marbles in the bag remained the same at T.To find the current number of black marbles in the bag after the second draw, we subtract the one black marble that was drawn and returned from the total after the first batch was removed. This gives us (11 - 1) = 10 black marbles.In summary:1. To find the initial number of black marbles, we divided the number of painted white marbles by 2: B = 20/2 = 10.2. There were initially 10 white marbles in the bag.3. The total number of marbles initially in the bag, T, is the sum of black and white marbles: T = B + W.4. The percentage of the original marbles represented by the second black marble drawn is (11/T) * 100%.5. After the first batch was pulled out and returned, the number of marbles stayed the same at T.6. The current number of black marbles in the bag is 10, after accounting for the one returned marble.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Question:During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost? Answer Choices: (A) 70 (B) 30 (C) 3 (D) 7 (E) 5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:tennis team, one season, won 20 matches, lost 30% of their matches, number of matches that the team lost.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of "lost 30% of their matches"?2. Is there any way to use the fact that the team won 20 matches to help solve the problem?3. Can we use algebra to solve the problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:1. Lost 30% of their matches means that 30% of the total number of matches played by the team were losses. We can find the total number of matches played by dividing the number of wins by the win percentage (in this case, 20 wins / 70% win rate = 28.57 matches played). Since we cannot have a fraction of a match, we will round this number down to 28 matches played.2. The fact that the team won 20 matches doesn't directly help us find the number of matches lost. However, we can use it in combination with the total number of matches played to find the number of matches lost.3. Yes, we can use algebra to solve the problem. Let L be the number of matches lost. We know that the total number of matches played is 28, so we can write the following equation:28 = 20 (matches won) + L (matches lost)
Solving for L, we get: L = 28 - 20 = 8 matches lost.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
 Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:sum, k consecutive integers, 51, least integer, -50.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the sum of consecutive integers?2. What algebraic procedure can be used to determine the value of k if the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50?3. Who or what determines the value of k in this sequence problem?4. In what type of problem does the concept of consecutive integers play a role?5. When would someone encounter a situation where they need to find the number of consecutive integers with a given sum?6. How can we calculate the value of k if we know the sum (51) and the smallest term (-50) in the sequence?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:Consecutive integers refer to a series of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding or subtracting a constant, usually 1, from the previous one. To find the sum of a set of consecutive integers, you employ the arithmetic progression formula, which is S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term (or the least integer in the sequence), and l is the last term (which is one more than the greatest integer).In the case where the sum is 51 and the least integer is -50, you can use this formula to determine the value of k, which represents the number of terms in the sequence. First, let's denote the first term as a = -50, the sum as S = 51, and we want to find n. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = 2S / (a + l). Since l = a + k (where k is the common difference, which is 1 for consecutive integers), we can substitute l into the equation: n = 2 * 51 / (-50 + (-50 + k)). Now, solving for k involves isolating it: k = 2S / n - 2 * a.The value of k depends on the specific problem context, but generally, it's determined by the given sum and the initial term or condition provided. Consecutive integer problems often arise in situations where you need to find the number of items in an evenly spaced list, such as calculating the total count in a series or determining the range of a set of numbers.To calculate k, you would plug in the known values (S = 51, a = -50), and then solve for n using the formula for the sum. Once you have n, you can substitute that back into the equation to find k. For example, if you find n, you'd compute k = 102 / n - 100. This algebraic procedure allows you to find the unknown quantity in the sequence of consecutive integers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:900 + 5 × 12 = ?

Step 1:Key elements of the question:900, 5, 12, equals.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation 900 + 5 × 12?2. What is the result of multiplying 5 by 12?3. In the expression 900 + (result from step 2), what is the sum?4. Which answer choice represents the correct result of the original equation?5. Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Add: +45 and -30 Answer Choices: (A) -30 (B) +30 (C) 0 (D) 15 (E) -15
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: addition, positive number, negative number.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the sign of the result when adding a positive number and a negative number? 2. How do you determine the absolute value of the result when adding two numbers with different signs? 3. What is the resulting value when combining the positive number 45 and the negative number -30? 4. How can you represent the result in terms of the available answer choices?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
- When adding a positive number and a negative number, their signs will cancel each other out, and the result will be positive if the absolute value of the larger number is greater than the absolute value of the smaller number, or negative if the absolute value of the smaller number is greater than the absolute value of the larger number.
- To determine the absolute value of the result, subtract the absolute value of the smaller number from the absolute value of the larger number.
- In this case, the positive number is 45, and the negative number is -30. The absolute value of 45 is greater than the absolute value of -30, so the result will be positive. Subtracting the absolute value of -30 (which is 30) from the absolute value of 45 gives 15, so the resulting value is 15.
- Based on the answer choices, option D corresponds to the calculated result.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:students, school, more than 501, 20% physics, 28% math, least possible number of students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What mathematical operation can we perform to find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math if we know the percentages of students taking each subject?2. What: How can we combine the given percentages of students taking physics (20%) and math (28%) to find the maximum overlap without exceeding the total count of more than 501 students?3. Who: In this context, what entity is responsible for ensuring that the least possible number of students are accounted for twice (once in physics and once in math)?4. Where: The problem is set in a school, so how does this context affect the calculation of the least possible number of students?5. When: Is there a specific constraint related to the timeframe in which the school's student population could be determined? If not, why does it not matter in this case?6. Why: Why is finding the least possible number of students important in this situation? Does it relate to budgeting, class sizes, or another relevant factor?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a hypothetical scenario at a school, the mathematics department and physics department conducted a survey to determine student enrollment. To find out the minimum number of students who could have taken both physics and math, we need to perform a mathematical operation known as set intersection. By subtracting the percentage of students taking only one subject from the total, we can estimate the overlap. First, let's calculate the percentage of students taking either physics or math or both. Since 20% took physics and 28% took math, we add these two percentages together (20% + 28% = 48%). However, since the total number of students cannot exceed 501, the overlap cannot account for more than this number. To avoid double-counting, we must subtract the sum of the percentages from 100% (the entire student population) and then find the intersection within the remaining 52% (100% - 48%).Now, let's assume that the overlap represents the least possible number of students taking both subjects. This implies that these students would not be counted twice in the physics and math counts. Therefore, the school administration, responsible for maintaining accurate records, is the entity ensuring this consistency.The context of the problem being set in a school affects the calculation because it provides the real-world setting where such enrollment data is typically gathered. However, there is no specific timeframe mentioned, and the calculation does not rely on a particular date, as long as the percentages are based on a consistent snapshot of the student population.The importance of finding the least possible number of students taking both subjects lies in efficient resource allocation and planning. It ensures that when allocating budgets for resources like classrooms, instructors, or materials, the school does not overestimate the demand for combined courses, thereby making the allocation more precise and cost-effective.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, children, girls, 2/5th, 100 boys.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the total number of children in the class if 100 boys represent 3/5th of the total?2. What mathematical operation can be applied to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal to compare it with the boys' ratio?3. Who or what is being represented by the fraction 2/5th in this context?4. Where does the concept of 2/5th come into play when calculating the number of girls in the class?5. When does the information about the 100 boys become relevant in determining the number of girls?6. Why is it necessary to divide the total number of children by 5 to find out the number of girls, given the information provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a class, the total number of children's composition was such that 100 boys represented 3/5th of the entire student body. To find the total number of children, we can set up the following equation using the given ratio:Let x be the total number of children.(3/5)x = 100 boysTo solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3:x = (100 boys) * (5/3)x = (100 * 5) / 3x = 500 / 3x ≈ 166.67Since the number of children must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately 167 children in the class.Now, to convert the fraction 2/5th into a decimal for comparison, we simply divide the numerator (2) by the denominator (5):Decimal representation of 2/5 = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4The fraction 2/5th represents the girls in the class, as it shows their proportion relative to the total students. When calculating the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of children, assuming the remaining students are girls:Number of girls = Total children - Number of boysNumber of girls = 167 - 100Number of girls = 67The information about the 100 boys becomes relevant when we're trying to determine the balance between boys and girls in the class. To find the exact number of girls, we need to know the total number of children first, which is obtained by dividing the total number of boys by their proportion (3/5) and then adjusting for the remaining students.Lastly, dividing the total number of children by 5 is necessary because the girls represent one-fifth of the total, as the boys represent three-fifths. Once we have the total, dividing by 5 gives us the number of equal parts each girl's group would occupy, which in this case is 67.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:200 students, at least 45% attended prom night, at least 35% took part in debating session, maximum number of students, neither attended prom night nor debating session.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the maximum number of students attending the prom night?2. How do we calculate the maximum number of students participating in the debating session?3. Can we assume that all students attending the prom night also participated in the debating session?4. How can we use the given attendance percentages to find the maximum number of students participating in both events?5. After finding the maximum number of students participating in both events, how can we calculate the maximum number of students who did not attend either event?6. What is the significance of the phrase "at least" in relation to the attendance percentages?7. Are there any constraints on the order in which students can participate in these activities?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the maximum number of students attending the prom night, we would multiply the total number of students (200) by the highest possible attendance percentage (45%). This gives us a maximum of 90 students attending the prom night.Similarly, to find the maximum number of students participating in the debating session, we multiply the total number of students (200) by the highest possible participation percentage (35%). This gives us a maximum of 70 students participating in the debating session.No, we cannot assume that all students attending the prom night also participated in the debating session, as the percentages are independent of each other. We need to find the maximum number of students participating in both events separately.To find the maximum number of students participating in both events, we need to consider the lowest possible overlap between the prom attendees and the debaters. This occurs when the attendance percentages are closest to each other. In this case, the difference between the percentages is 10%. So, we take the smaller percentage (35%) and multiply it by the overlapping percentage (10%). This gives us a maximum of 7 students participating in both events.After finding the maximum number of students participating in both events, we can calculate the maximum number of students who did not attend either event by subtracting the sum of the maximum participants from the total number of students. This means:200 students - (90 students + 70 students - 7 students) = 200 - 153 = 47 studentsThe phrase "at least" indicates that the given percentages represent the minimum number of students participating in each activity. This means that our calculations for the maximum number of students attending each event and participating in both are valid under the assumption that the actual numbers might be higher than the minimums provided.No, there are no constraints on the order in which students can participate in these activities. The problem only asks for the maximum number of students who did not attend either event, regardless of whether they attended one event but not the other or neither event.

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:brings each copper coin, bottom of a river, 20 cents, brass coin, 25 cents, one dive, $3.40, minimum number of copper coins.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the value of one copper coin?2. What is the value of one brass coin?3. How many dollars did the coin-diver earn from diving once?4. What is the smallest possible number of copper coins the coin-diver could have retrieved?5. Can we conclude that the coin-diver retrieved only copper coins?6. Is there a combination of copper and brass coins that adds up to $3.40?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:1. One copper coin is worth 20 cents.2. One brass coin is worth 25 cents.3. The coin-diver earned $3.40 from diving once.4. To minimize the number of copper coins, we should maximize the number of brass coins.5. No, we cannot conclude that the coin-diver retrieved only copper coins because the total earnings can also come from a mix of both types of coins.6. Yes, we can try different combinations of copper and brass coins to see if they add up to $3.40. By trial and error, we can find that if the coin-diver retrieves 2 copper coins and 10 brass coins, the total value would be 2 _20 cents + 10_ 25 cents = 20 cents + 250 cents = 270 cents = $2.70. This is less than $3.40. If we increase the number of copper coins by 1, the total value becomes 3_ 20 cents + 10_ 25 cents = 60 cents + 250 cents = 310 cents = $3.10. This is still less than $3.40. If we increase the number of copper coins by another 1, the total value becomes 4_ 20 cents + 10_ 25 cents = 80 cents + 250 cents = 330 cents = $3.30. This is also less than $3.40. If we increase the number of copper coins by another 1, the total value becomes 5_ 20 cents + 10_ 25 cents = 100 cents + 250 cents = 350 cents = $3.50. This is greater than $3.40. Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver could have retrieved is 4.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bee, flowers, bypasses, 0.05%, nectar, 8 flowers.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should we use to find out how many flowers the bee would typically fly by without bypassing any?2. What percentage of flowers does the bee actually inspect when it bypasses 8 flowers?3. How many flowers does the bee inspect before it bypasses one flower?4. Given the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, what fraction of the flowers it encounters represents those it bypasses?5. In order to find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, what formula can we apply using the given bypass rate?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option represents the total number of flowers the bee would inspect if it bypasses 8 flowers based on the given bypass rate?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the bee's flower inspection process, let's denote the total number of flowers as \( F \). According to the problem, the bee bypasses a certain percentage of flowers, which is given as 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \) (as a decimal). 1. To find out how many flowers the bee would typically inspect without bypassing any, we simply divide the total number of flowers by 1, so \( F \) flowers.2. When the bee bypasses 8 flowers, the percentage inspected is \( 100\% - 0.05\% \), which simplifies to \( 99.95\% \) of the flowers. To find the fraction, we divide this percentage by 100: \( \frac{99.95}{100} \).3. To find out how many flowers the bee inspects before bypassing one, we need to invert the bypass rate. Since the bee bypasses 0.05%, it inspects \( 100\% - 0.05\% = 99.95\% \) for each flower. Therefore, we can express this as \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \).4. The fraction of flowers bypassed is the bypass rate, which is 0.05% or \( 0.0005 \).5. To find the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, we can set up the equation \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \). Solving for \( F \), we rearrange the terms and multiply both sides by 0.9995 to isolate \( F \).6. Once we solve the equation from step 5, we will get the total number of flowers the bee would inspect before bypassing 8, denoted as \( T \).After performing the calculations, we find that:- The bee would inspect \( F \) flowers without bypassing.- It inspects \( \frac{99.95}{100} \) or approximately 99.95% of flowers per flower.- Before bypassing one flower, it inspects \( \frac{F}{0.9995} \) flowers.- The fraction of bypassed flowers is \( 0.0005 \).- The total number of flowers inspected before bypassing 8 is determined by solving \( F - 8 = 8 \times \frac{F}{0.9995} \).The specific numerical values for the total number of flowers before bypassing 8 cannot be determined without knowing the total number of flowers (\( F \)) in the first place. However, the passage provides the steps needed to calculate it given \( F \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
 Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:survey of students, list of 10 songs, 2 songs, liked best, each song selected 5 times, students surveyed.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the total number of song selections made by students?2. What calculation can be used to find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students?3. Who are the subjects involved in the survey, and how many unique combinations of two songs could be selected by them?4. In what type of scenario does the "list of 10 songs" play a role?5. When does the fact that each song was selected 5 times come into play in determining the number of students surveyed?6. How can we relate the information about each song being selected 5 times to the total number of students surveyed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a survey conducted among students, a list of 10 songs was provided, and it was observed that each song was selected exactly 5 times. To determine the total number of song selections made by students, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each song is selected 5 times independently, we multiply the total number of songs by the number of selections per song:Total song selections = Number of songs * Selections per songTotal song selections = 10 songs * 5Total song selections = 50To find out how many pairs of songs were chosen by the students, we calculate the number of combinations when selecting 2 songs from the 10 available, which follows the combination formula C(n, k) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose:Number of pairs = C(10, 2)Using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)Number of pairs = 10! / (2! * 8!)Number of pairs = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)Number of pairs = 45The subjects involved in the survey are the students, and there are 45 unique combinations of two songs that could be selected by them. The "list of 10 songs" played a role as the basis for these song pairings. The fact that each song was selected 5 times indicates that there must have been 5 students who participated, as each student contributed to all 10 songs being selected. Therefore, to determine the number of students surveyed, we divide the total song selections by the number of selections per song:Number of students = Total song selections / Selections per studentNumber of students = 50 / 5Number of students = 10In summary, the survey involved 10 students who collectively made 50 song selections, with 45 unique pairs of songs chosen. Each song was selected 5 times, and this information helped to reveal that there were 10 students in the study.

Question:If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 12 (E) 14
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: bottles of soda, party, 8 people, 10 bottles, 12 people.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many bottles of soda did each person at the first party consume?2. Can we assume that the consumption pattern will remain the same for the second party?3. How many bottles of soda will be required for each person at the second party?4. What is the total number of bottles required for the second party?5. Does the answer choice reflect the result obtained from the previous step?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
1. At the first party, Jill bought 10 bottles of soda for 8 people, meaning each person consumed 10 bottles / 8 people = 1.25 bottles/person.
2. There is no information indicating that the consumption pattern will change, so we can assume that each person will still consume 1.25 bottles of soda at the second party.
3. With 12 people attending the second party, we can estimate the number of bottles required for each person by multiplying the number of attendees by the consumption rate: 12 people * 1.25 bottles/person = 15 bottles.
4. Therefore, Jill needs to buy 15 bottles of soda for the second party.
5. Comparing our calculated result with the answer choices, we see that none of the options match our result. Option E comes closest, but it is still greater than our calculated value.

Hence, among A through E, the answer is None of the above choices (since none of the options match the calculated result).

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
 Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:pita breads, falafel, six pita breads, two rolls, three rolls, five baguettes, two baguettes.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes do, given that three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes and six pita breads equal two rolls?2. What is the relationship between the falafel quantities in pita breads and baguettes, if we know that three rolls have the same amount as five baguettes and two rolls are equivalent to six pita breads?3. Who are the entities involved in this comparison - pita breads, rolls, and baguettes - when trying to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes?4. In what context does this problem take place, where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread?5. Given the information about the ratios, when would you solve for the unknown quantity (number of pita breads), assuming you have the necessary data on falafel content?6. Why is it important to find out the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, based on the given ratios?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a culinary context where the quantities of falafel are being compared across different types of bread, a fascinating calculation can be made using the provided ratios. To determine how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we first establish the conversion factors. Three rolls are equivalent to five baguettes, meaning each roll holds (5/3) times the falafel content of a baguette. Additionally, six pita breads equal two rolls, implying one pita bread contains (1/3) of a roll's falafel.To find out the number of pita breads needed, we set up the following equation: If x represents the number of pita breads, then (x * (1/3) rolls) must equal the falafel content of two baguettes. Since we know each baguette is equivalent to (5/3) rolls, we can write:(x * (1/3)) = 2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguetteNow, let's solve for x:x = (2 baguettes * (5/3) rolls/baguette) / (1/3)Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:3x = 2 * 53x = 10x = 10 / 3So, approximately 3.33 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. This comparison highlights the relative falafel quantities across pita breads, rolls, and baguettes, providing insight into portion sizes and ingredient distribution in various types of sandwiches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:rice, wheat, corn, ratio, 2:3:5, bag of mixture, 3 pounds of rice, corn含量．
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the total weight of rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio 2:3:5?2. What is the total weight of the bag of mixture if it contains 3 pounds of rice?3. How much corn does the bag of mixture contain?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:
1. The total weight of rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio 2:3:5 can be calculated by finding the sum of their respective weights in the ratio. We can represent the ratio as follows: Rice : Wheat : Corn = 2x : 3x : 5x, where x is a common factor. So, the total weight of all three components is 2x + 3x + 5x = 10x.
2. If the bag of mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, we can equate the weight of rice in the ratio to 3 pounds and solve for x. Thus, 2x = 3 pounds, which implies x = 3/2 pounds.
3. To find the amount of corn in the bag of mixture, we can substitute the value of x back into the expression for corn weight: Corn = 5x = 5 * (3/2) pounds = 7.5 pounds.

Therefore, the answer is B.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Question:[(272 - 32) (124 + 176)] / (17 x 15 - 15) = ? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 2.25 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:272, 32, 124, 176, 17, 15, ?.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the difference between 272 and 32?2. What is the sum of 124 and 176?3. How do you simplify the numerator of the fraction [(272 - 32)(124 + 176)]/(17 x 15 - 15)?4. How do you simplify the denominator of the fraction [(272 - 32)(124 + 176)]/(17 x 15 - 15)?5. What is the value of the simplified fraction [(272 - 32)(124 + 176)]/(17 x 15 - 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:1. To find the difference between 272 and 32, we simply subtract 32 from 272: \( 272 - 32 = 240 \).2. To find the sum of 124 and 176, we add them together: \( 124 + 176 = 300 \).3. To simplify the numerator of the fraction, we substitute the results from steps 1 and 2: \( (272 - 32)(124 + 176) = 240 \times 300 = 72000 \).4. To simplify the denominator of the fraction, we first calculate the product of 17 and 15: \( 17 \times 15 = 255 \). Then, we subtract 15 from 255: \( 255 - 15 = 240 \).5. Now that we have simplified both the numerator and denominator, we can evaluate the fraction: \( \frac{72000}{240} = 300 \).

 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Question:The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:number of water lilies, doubles every two days, one water lily, 60 days, lake fully covered, initially, 64 water lilies..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the doubling of water lilies represent in terms of exponential growth?2. How many times does the number of water lilies double during the 60 days when starting with one lily?3. What is the initial condition that needs to be considered for the 64 water lilies?4. In how many days would the lake be half-covered if there were initially 64 water lilies?5. Given the doubling pattern, how many days would it take for 64 water lilies to double to the point of covering half the lake?6. How many doublings are needed for 64 water lilies to cover the entire lake, considering the lake started with one lily?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The doubling of water lilies represents an exponential growth process, where the number of plants increases at a constant rate. To calculate the number of times the lilies double during 60 days, we can use the formula for exponential growth: \( N = N_0 \times 2^{t/d} \), where \( N \) is the final number, \( N_0 \) is the initial number (one lily), \( t \) is the time (in days), and \( d \) is the doubling period.For the first question, since the lake doubles every day, \( d = 1 \) day. So after 60 days, \( N = 1 \times 2^{60/1} = 1 \times 2^{60} \). This indicates that the lilies double 60 times over 60 days.Now, for the second question, since the initial condition was one lily, the lake would be half-covered if there are 64 lilies. To find out how many doublings this represents, we can use the formula again with \( N_0 = 1 \) and \( N = 64 \): \( 64 = 1 \times 2^x \), solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \log_2(64) = 6 \) doublings. For the third question, if there are initially 64 water lilies, we need to determine how many days it takes for them to cover half the lake. Since each doubling covers half the remaining area, we don't need to calculate the exact number of days but can infer that it would be half the number of doublings required for 64 to double to 128 (covering the whole lake). So, it would take 3 doublings (since \( 2^3 = 8 \), and 8 is half of 16).Finally, to find out how many days it takes for 64 lilies to double to cover half the lake, we use the same logic as before: since each doubling halves the remaining area, it would take half the number of doublings to go from 64 to 32, which is \( \log_2(32) = 5 \) days.To cover the entire lake, we've established that 6 doublings are needed, so if we start with one lily, it would take \( 6 \times 1 \) day, which is 6 days.In summary, the doubling of water lilies represents an exponential growth process. Over 60 days, they double 60 times when starting with one lily. For 64 lilies to cover half the lake, it would take 3 doublings, which is approximately 5 days. To cover the entire lake, 64 lilies require 6 doublings, taking 6 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Shweta, rides, rate of 10 km per hour, stops, 10 minutes rest, every 15 km, cover, 100 km..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does Shweta perform when calculating her total travel time?2. What is the distance she covers without stopping each time?3. How many times does she need to stop for a rest during the 100 km journey?4. How long does each rest period last in terms of hours?5. In how many intervals of 15 km does she ride before taking a break?6. How can we combine her riding time and resting time to find the total time taken to cover 100 km?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Shweta's strategy for her 100 km journey involves a unique pattern of riding and resting. She maintains a steady pace without stopping for the first part of the trip. To calculate her total travel time, Shweta performs simple arithmetic by dividing the total distance by her continuous riding speed. Let's assume she rides at a constant speed of 20 km/h.1. When calculating her total travel time, Shweta uses the formula: Time (hours) = Distance (km) / Speed (km/h). Since she rides without stopping initially, we only consider this part of the calculation.2. The distance she covers without stopping each time is 100 km, as she is riding continuously until she reaches the first rest point.3. To find out how many times she needs to stop for a rest, we divide the total distance by the distance she rides before needing a break. Assuming she takes a break after every 15 km, we calculate: Breaks = Total Distance / Interval Distance = 100 km / 15 km = 6.67, which rounds up to 7 breaks because she cannot take a fraction of a break.4. Each rest period lasts the same duration. If she takes a break after completing one interval, the rest time would be the time it takes to ride 15 km at her speed. Rest Time (hours) = Interval Distance (km) / Speed (km/h) = 15 km / 20 km/h = 0.75 hours.5. Since she rides 15 km before taking a break, we can say that she rides in 6 intervals (as calculated above) before stopping for the first time, and then again after each subsequent interval.6. To combine her riding time and resting time, we sum up the time for each interval. There are 7 intervals, including the initial one where she rides continuously. For the first interval, there's no rest, so the time is just the distance divided by speed. For the other intervals, we add the riding time and the rest time. So, Total Time (hours) = (100 km - (15 km * 6)) / 20 km/h + (0.75 hours * 6).In summary, Shweta rides at a speed of 20 km/h, covering 100 km in 5 hours (100 km / 20 km/h), taking 7 breaks, each lasting 0.75 hours. After accounting for the rest periods, her total time to cover 100 km is approximately 5.25 hours (100 km / 20 km/h + (0.75 * 6)).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:well, depth 30m, frog, bottom of the well, jumps 3m up, falls back 2m down, days, come out of the well.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much progress does the frog make each day towards reaching the top of the well?2. Is there any specific day when the frog makes more progress than usual?3. Can the frog reach the top of the well in less than 30 days?4. If the frog reaches the top of the well on the last day, does he fall back down?5. How do we calculate the number of days it takes for the frog to escape the well?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:
1. The frog makes a net progress of 1 meter per day (jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down).
2. No, the frog makes the same amount of progress every day.
3. Yes, the frog can reach the top of the well in fewer than 30 days because it only needs to climb 30 meters and makes a net progress of 1 meter per day.
4. No, once the frog reaches the top of the well, it escapes and doesn't fall back down.
5. We can calculate the number of days it takes for the frog to escape the well by dividing the well's depth (30 meters) by the net progress made per day (1 meter). However, we must also account for the fact that the frog may make enough progress in the final day to escape the well even though it hasn't climbed 1 meter.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B.

Question:A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, travel, south, 3km, east, 5km, north, 3km, west, 2km, from home..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which direction does A need to travel to return to their starting point from the final location?2. How far has A traveled in a straight line from their initial position?3. How many kilometers did A cover in total during their journey?4. After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars?
 Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Car 'X', distance 320 kms, 8 hours, Car 'Y', distance 415 kms, 5 hours, speed difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which car has a higher speed: Car 'X' or Car 'Y'?2. How far does Car 'X' travel per hour?3. What is the speed of Car 'X' in kilometers per hour?4. How far does Car 'Y' travel per hour?5. What is the speed of Car 'Y' in kilometers per hour?6. To find the speed difference, how many kilometers per hour does Car 'Y' travel more than Car 'X'?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After analyzing the given data, we can determine the speeds and distances traveled by both cars, Car 'X' and Car 'Y'. Unfortunately, no specific numerical values were provided for the speeds or distances. However, we can assume that if you have the necessary information, such as their respective speeds in miles per hour (mph) or meters per second (m/s), we can convert them into kilometers per hour (km/h) using the following conversions:1 mph = 1.60934 km/h1 m/s = 3.6 km/hTo compare the speeds, let's denote the speed of Car 'X' as \( V_X \) (in km/h) and the speed of Car 'Y' as \( V_Y \) (also in km/h). If \( V_X > V_Y \), then Car 'X' has a higher speed.For the distances traveled per hour, we would need the time traveled for each car to calculate the distance covered. Assuming they travel at constant speeds, the distance \( D_X \) for Car 'X' in one hour is \( V_X \) multiplied by the time, and similarly for Car 'Y', the distance \( D_Y \) is \( V_Y \) times the time.The speed difference between Car 'Y' and Car 'X' is calculated as \( |V_Y - V_X| \) (absolute value since we are only interested in the magnitude).Without the actual speeds, we cannot provide specific numbers for these calculations. However, if you provide the speeds or any other relevant data, we can easily perform the calculations and construct the passage accordingly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Allen, start from X, goes to Y, Bob, start from Y, goes to X, change direction, Allen travels 54 kmph, Bob travels 78 kmph, second meeting, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, distance between X and Y.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How do we know when Allen and Bob have met for the second time?2. Can we express the distance between X and Y using the relative speed of Allen and Bob?3. What is the relationship between the distance covered by Allen and the distance covered by Bob during their journey?4. Is there a way to determine the distance between X and Y using the given information?5. Can we apply the relative speed concept to solve the problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When Allen and Bob meet for the second time, they must have collectively covered twice the distance between X and Y. Let's denote the distance between X and Y as \( d \). We can use the relative speed concept to determine the distance between X and Y since they move towards each other and then move away from each other. During the entire journey, the combined speed of Allen and Bob is \( 54 + 78 = 132 \) kmph. Since they meet for the second time after covering twice the distance between X and Y, we can say that they collectively travel a distance of \( 2d \).

Now, according to the problem, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time. This means that during the entire journey, Bob traveled an additional 48 km compared to Allen. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ (78t - 54t) = 48 \]
where \( t \) represents the time taken for them to meet for the second time.

Solving for \( t \):
\[ 24t = 48 \]
\[ t = 2 \]

Now that we have the time, we can calculate the distance between X and Y:
\[ d = (54 + 78) \times t \]
\[ d = 132 \times 2 \]
\[ d = 264 \]

However, since they meet for the second time after covering twice the distance between X and Y, the actual distance between X and Y is half of the collective distance:
\[ d_{actual} = \frac{264}{2} \]
\[ d_{actual} = 132 \]

But none of the options match this result. It seems like there might be a mistake in the question or the given answer choices. Please double-check the question and the answer choices for accuracy.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of these.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:rate of draining, w/25 gallons, every x seconds, minutes, y gallons, pass through the drain, time required.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the connection between the rate of draining and the time required for y gallons to pass through the drain?2. How can the relationship between rate, time, and quantity be expressed mathematically?3. Is there any way to simplify the expression involving w, x, and y?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The key elements of the problem involve the draining rate of the liquid, which is given as \( w/25 \) gallons every \( x \) seconds. We want to find out how many minutes it will take for \( y \) gallons to pass through the drain. To solve this problem, we need to relate the draining rate, time, and the quantity of liquid passing through the drain. The formula connecting these three variables is:\[ \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = \text{Quantity} \]Using the given rate of draining,\[\begin{aligned} \text{Time} &= \frac{\text{Quantity}}{\text{Rate}} \\ &= \frac{y\text{ gallons}}{(w/25)\text{ gallons}/x\text{ seconds}} \end{aligned}\]Converting the time from seconds to minutes, we multiply the result by \( 60 \):\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = 60 \times \frac{y\text{ gallons}}{(w/25)\text{ gallons}/x\text{ seconds}} \]Simplifying the expression gives us the answer in terms of \( w \), \( x \), and \( y \).

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Question:A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:jeep, forward journey, 6 hours, return journey, increased speed, 12km/hr, 4 hours, distance travelled, options A through E.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which formula can be used to calculate the distance traveled based on speed and time?2. What is the relationship between the forward journey and the return journey?3. How do you calculate the increase in speed?4. Who is the subject performing the action (traveling) in this problem?5. Where does the jeep begin and end its journey?6. When does the change in speed occur - during the forward journey or the return journey?7. Can we use the given information to form an equation linking the speed, time, and distance traveled?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To solve this problem, we can use the formula for calculating distance, which is given by the product of speed and time. We have the following details for the forward journey and the return journey:

Forward Journey:
- Time: 6 hours
- Return Journey:
- Increased speed: 12 km/hr
- Time: 4 hours

We can use the distance formula to create an equation connecting the two journeys. Since the distance remains the same, we can write:

Distance (forward journey) = Distance (return journey)

Using the distance formula, we get:

Speed (forward journey) × Time (forward journey) = Speed (return journey) × Time (return journey)

Now, we can substitute the known quantities and solve for the unknown distance. We know that the return journey speed was increased by 12 km/hr over the forward journey speed, so we need to find the original speed.

Let's denote the initial speed as s. Then, the speed during the return journey is (s + 12).

So, our equation becomes:

s × 6 = (s + 12) × 4

Expanding the right-hand side gives us:

6s = 4s + 48

Solving for s, we get:

2s = 48

s = 24 km/hr

Now that we know the initial speed, we can calculate the distance traveled during the forward journey:

Distance (forward journey) = Speed (forward journey) × Time (forward journey)
Distance (forward journey) = 24 km/hr × 6 hours
Distance (forward journey) = 144 km

Hence, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.
 Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, eat, fruit (breakfast), vegetable (dinner), 6 different types of fruit, 8 different types of vegetables, eat one type at a time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of combinations when selecting one type of fruit for breakfast?2. How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day. Answer Choices: (A) 93 men (B) 94 men (C) 95 men (D) 96 men (E) 97 men
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:8 men, 6 days, complete a work, same work, 1/2 day, required men, answer choices.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the basic principle behind the problem?2. Can the work be divided into smaller parts?3. Is there any relationship between the number of men and the time taken to complete the work?4. How can the problem be simplified by breaking down the task into simpler steps?5. What is the formula for calculating the required number of men based on the given information?6. Are the given answer choices relevant to the problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:This problem deals with the concept of work and its division among men over a period of time. It involves understanding the relationship between the number of men, the time taken to complete a job, and the amount of work involved. The key to solving this problem lies in recognizing that the work remains constant, while the number of men and the time taken can change. Therefore, the work can be divided into smaller parts and the problem can be simplified by breaking it down into simpler steps.

The formula for calculating the required number of men is given by:
Men required ∝ Time taken

or,
Men required ∝ Amount of work done

Since the work is the same in both cases, we can say that:

8 men × 6 days = New number of men × 1/2 day

Solving for the new number of men:

New number of men = (8 men × 6 days) ÷ (1/2 day)
New number of men = 48 men ÷ (1/2)

Multiplying by the reciprocal of 1/2:

New number of men = 48 men × 2
New number of men = 96 men

Comparing the calculated value with the given answer choices, we can see that the closest option is D.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:two balls, circular track, ball A, 2 full rotations, 26 minutes, ball B, 5 full rotations, 35 minutes, start rotating, same point, when, same starting point again.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How fast does ball A rotate?2. How fast does ball B rotate?3. How long does it take for ball A to make one complete rotation?4. How long does it take for ball B to make one complete rotation?5. How long does it take for ball A to catch up with ball B once they start rotating from the same point?6. How long does it take for both balls to reach the same starting point again after they've caught up?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:1. To find out how fast ball A rotates, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time, where distance is 2 full rotations and time is 26 minutes. Since there are 2π radians in a full circle, we have: Speed A = 2(2π)/26 minutes/radian.2. Similarly, to find out how fast ball B rotates, we have: Speed B = 5(2π)/35 minutes/radian.3. To find out how long it takes for ball A to make one complete rotation, we can rearrange the formula for speed: Time = Distance / Speed. So, time for one rotation for ball A is: Time A = 2π / (2(2π)/26 minutes/radian) = 13 minutes.4. Similarly, time for one rotation for ball B is: Time B = 2π / (5(2π)/35 minutes/radian) = 14 minutes.5. To find out how long it takes for ball A to catch up with ball B, we can set up an equation based on the relative speed between them. The relative speed is the difference between their individual speeds: Relative Speed = Speed A - Speed B. Plugging in the values, we get: Relative Speed = (2(2π)/26 minutes/radian) - (5(2π)/35 minutes/radian). Then, we can use the formula: Catch-up Time = Distance / Relative Speed, where distance is the difference in positions when they start rotating simultaneously. The difference in positions is equal to one full rotation for ball B. So, Catch-up Time = 1(2π) / [(2(2π)/26 minutes/radian) - (5(2π)/35 minutes/radian)]. Solving this equation gives us the time needed for ball A to catch up with ball B.6. Once ball A catches up with ball B, it will take them both the same time to reach the starting point again. This time is equal to their common time for one rotation. Since ball A has a shorter time for one rotation, we can simply take the time for one rotation of ball A as our answer.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
 Answer Choices: (A) M + N / 8 (B) 2M + N / 8 (C) M + N / 4 (D) M + 3N / 8 (E) M + N / 5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:athlete, M miles, 4 hours, rides, bike, N miles, average speed, miles per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation combines the distances M miles and N miles to find the total distance traveled for both activities?2. How should the time taken (4 hours) be incorporated when calculating the average speed?3. What type of average speed is being asked for - arithmetic mean or another form?4. Who or what is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the athlete running and biking or just the combined activities?5. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the combined activities' performance?6. How are the values M and N related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different modes of transportation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When combining the distances covered during two separate activities, one can use the addition operation to find the total distance traveled. For instance, if an athlete runs M miles and then cycles N miles, the combined distance, denoted as D_total, would be calculated as follows:D_total = M miles + N milesTo incorporate the time taken for both activities, let's say it's 4 hours, we need to calculate the average speed, which represents the overall efficiency in terms of distance covered per unit time. The average speed (V_avg) is found by dividing the total distance by the total time spent on the activities:V_avg = D_total / Time (in hours)In this case, the average speed is an arithmetic mean, as it's a simple average of the speeds achieved during each mode of transportation without considering any variations or weights.The subject of the "average speed" calculation is the athlete, as it reflects their combined performance in running and biking. This average speed gives an indication of their overall pace for the day, regardless of whether they were faster on one activity or the other.The context in which this average speed is relevant is when assessing the athlete's endurance or comparing their performance across different days. By calculating V_avg, we can gauge how efficiently they utilized their time and energy during the combined running and biking session.The values M and N are directly related to the average speed formula, as they contribute to the numerator (total distance), while the time taken (4 hours) serves as the denominator, ultimately determining the rate at which the athlete covered the combined distance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, 5 kmph, 6 hrs, 4 kmph, 12 hrs, average speed
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What formula is used to calculate average speed?2. What is the distance traveled at 5 kmph for 6 hours?3. What is the distance traveled at 4 kmph for 12 hours?4. How do you combine the distances traveled to calculate the total distance?5. Who is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the man or someone else?6. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the man's performance?7. How are the values 5 kmph, 6 hours, 4 kmph, and 12 hours related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different segments of the journey?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To solve this problem, we must first calculate the total distance traveled by the man. We can then use the formula for average speed to determine the final result. The formula for average speed is:\[Average Speed = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\]The man spends 6 hours walking at 5 kmph and 12 hours walking at 4 kmph. Let's calculate the distance traveled in each segment separately:Distance Travelled at 5 kmph:\[distance_{5kmph} = speed_{5kmph} \times time_{5kmph}\]\[distance_{5kmph} = 5 kmph \times 6 hours = 30 km\]Distance Travelled at 4 kmph:\[distance_{4kmph} = speed_{4kmph} \times time_{4kmph}\]\[distance_{4kmph} = 4 kmph \times 12 hours = 48 km\]Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled:\[total\_distance = distance_{5kmph} + distance_{4kmph}\]\[total\_distance = 30 km + 48 km = 78 km\]Finally, we can calculate the average speed by using the formula mentioned earlier:Average Speed:\[average\_speed = \frac{total\_distance}{total\_time}\]\[average\_speed = \frac{78 km}{(6+12) hours} = \frac{78 km}{18 hours} = 4.33 kmph \approx 4 \frac{1}{3} kmph\]

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two ants, ant A, ant B, moving towards each other, speed of ant A, 9 cm per hour, speed of ant B, 6 cm per hour, distance between farms, 75 cm.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. Which operation can be used to find the time taken for the ants to meet? 2. What is the combined speed of the ants? 3. Who is the subject of the problem when finding the distance traveled by ant A (ant A)?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the time taken for the ants to meet, we can divide the total distance between the farms by their combined speed. The combined speed is the sum of the individual speeds of ant A and ant B.
Let's denote the time taken for the ants to meet as \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{\text{Distance between farms}}{\text{Combined speed}} \]
The combined speed is \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) cm per hour. So,
\[ t = \frac{75}{15} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now that we know the time taken for the ants to meet, we can calculate the distance traveled by ant A during this time. We'll use the formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
Since ant A has a speed of 9 cm per hour and the time taken is 5 hours, we can calculate the distance traveled by ant A:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by ant A} = 9 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Distance traveled by ant A} = 45 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Bells, intervals, 36 seconds, 40 seconds, 48 seconds, starting ringing together, next time ringing together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How can we determine the next time all three bells will ring together after they start ringing at the same time?2. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48?3. How does finding the LCM help us determine the next time the bells will ring together?4. What is the relationship between the LCM and the actual time (in minutes) when the bells will ring together again?5. How can we express the result in minutes, given the initial options provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the next time all three bells will ring together after they start ringing at the same time, we must find the least common multiple (LCM) of their respective intervals. The LCM represents the smallest number that is divisible by all three numbers. In this case, we want to find the smallest interval that will make all three bells ring at once again.Finding the LCM of 36, 40, and 48 helps us identify the next common time point when all three bells will ring together. By calculating the LCM, we ensure that we're accounting for all the possible combinations of bell-ringing patterns within those intervals and selecting the one that makes all three rings occur simultaneously.Relationship between the LCM and the actual time (in minutes): Since we already converted the intervals to seconds earlier, we now need to convert the LCM back to minutes. We can do this by dividing the LCM value by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).Expressing the result in minutes: With the LCM calculated in minutes, we can easily identify the correct choice among the provided options.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Three friends (Alan, Roger, Peter), answer a question, exam, Alan, 1/5 probability, guessing correctly, Roger, cheating, 2/3 probability, answering correctly, Peter, 5/6 probability, correct answer, cheating not via..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the probability of a correct answer without cheating?2. What is the probability that Alan answers the question correctly?3. How can we combine Alan's and Peter's probabilities to find the total non-cheating probability?4. Who has the highest probability of answering correctly without cheating?5. In what context does the problem take place, i.e., the exam situation?6. Why is it important to consider both cheating and non-cheating probabilities when determining the overall answer?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In an exam setting, it is crucial to account for both cheating and non-cheating probabilities when assessing a student's performance. To find the probability of a correct answer without cheating, one would typically use the concept of independent events. If Alan and Peter each have their own individual chances of answering correctly, which are P(A) and P(P), respectively, without any prior information about their study habits, we assume they are independent.To calculate the probability of Alan answering correctly (P(A)) without cheating, we need to know his actual skill level or the provided probability. Let's say P(A) = 0.7, meaning there's a 70% chance he knows the answer. Similarly, if Peter's probability is P(P) = 0.6, he has a 60% chance of getting it right.To combine their probabilities for the total non-cheating probability, we multiply their individual probabilities because their actions are assumed to be independent. So, the combined probability (P(both correct)) is P(A) * P(P) = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42, or 42%.Comparing their probabilities, Alan has a slightly higher non-cheating probability than Peter. This indicates that, without any external influence, Alan is more likely to answer correctly on this particular question.In conclusion, considering both cheating and non-cheating probabilities is essential in an exam context as it provides a comprehensive understanding of students' abilities. It ensures fairness and accuracy in evaluating their knowledge without being swayed by potential dishonesty. In this case, Alan has the highest probability of answering correctly without cheating, which contributes to a more reliable assessment of their academic prowess.

Question:Roy was suffering from severe headaches. He went to see his doctor and the doctor gave him 5 tablets asking him to take one tablet every 15 minutes.
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Roy, suffering from headaches, doctor, 5 tablets, one tablet every 15 minutes.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How many 15-minute intervals are there in an hour? 2. Can Roy complete taking all 5 tablets within an hour based on the instructions given by the doctor?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that: 1. There are four 15-minute intervals in an hour (i.e., 60 minutes ÷ 15 minutes per interval = 4 intervals).
2. To determine if Roy can take all 5 tablets within an hour, we need to divide the number of tablets by the number of 15-minute intervals in an hour. 

Now let's perform the calculation:
Number of tablets = 5
Number of 15-minute intervals in an hour = 4

Can Roy take all 5 tablets within an hour?

Divide the number of tablets by the number of intervals:

5 tablets ÷ 4 intervals = 1.25 tablets per interval

Since Roy cannot take a fraction of a tablet, he won't be able to follow the doctor's instructions exactly within an hour. However, he could come close by taking one tablet every 12 minutes, allowing him to take all five tablets within approximately 60 minutes (5 tablets × 12 minutes per tablet).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

After traveling towards the east and then back west, what distance did A cover along the east-west axis?5. What is the shortest distance between A's starting point and their final location?6. If A's home is considered as the origin, which quadrant would the final position be in?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After completing their journey, A found themselves at a location that was 120 kilometers due north from their starting point. To return to their origin, they needed to head in the south direction. To calculate the straight-line distance from the initial position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the straight-line distance) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, since the northward displacement is 120 km and the starting point is 120 km away (forming a right-angled triangle), the straight-line distance is also 120 km.Throughout the journey, A covered a total of 240 kilometers, as they initially moved 120 km east and then returned the same distance west. Along the east-west axis, the net distance after traveling towards the east and back west is zero, as the eastward and westward movements cancel each other out.The shortest distance between A's starting point and final location, which is a straight-line distance, is 120 kilometers, as mentioned earlier. If we consider A's home as the origin, the final position, which is 120 km north, would place it in the second quadrant because it is both north and east of the origin.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Kevin, drove, A to B, constant speed, 70 mph, turned right around, no pause, returned to A, constant speed, 90 mph, exactly 3 hours, end of trip, approaching B, 70 miles away, distance between A and B, Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the average speed of Kevin's entire round trip?2. Is there any relationship between the distance between A and B and Kevin's average speed?3. Can we solve for the distance between A and B based on the given information and the relationship between average speed and the distance?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the average speed of Kevin's entire round trip, we can use the harmonic mean formula for two different speeds:\[\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2 \times \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Speed}_2}{\text{Speed}_1 + \text{Speed}_2}\]Here, \(\text{Speed}_1\) is 70 mph and \(\text{Speed}_2\) is 90 mph:\[\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2 \times 70 \times 90}{70 + 90}\]\[\text{Average Speed} = \frac{12600}{160}\]\[\text{Average Speed} = 78.75 \text{ mph}\]Now, let's consider the information about Kevin being 70 miles away from B exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip. This tells us that he traveled 70 miles in 3 hours at an average speed of 78.75 mph. However, this information alone is insufficient to determine the distance between A and B, as it only provides details about the last leg of Kevin's journey. There is no direct relationship between the average speed and the distance between A and B, so we cannot use the given information and the relationship between average speed and distance to solve for the distance between A and B.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cycling, 12 miles per hour, travel, 48 miles, minutes..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the time it takes for the cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed?2. What formula can be applied to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, considering there are 60 minutes in an hour?3. Who is the subject performing the action in this problem - the cyclist or the observer measuring the time?4. In what context would you typically encounter a situation where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover a specific distance?5. When would someone need to know how long it takes a cyclist to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour? For instance, planning a route or estimating arrival time.6. Why is it important to know the time it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles if their speed is constant at 12 miles per hour? Could it be related to pacing or efficiency?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When calculating the time it takes for a cyclist to travel a certain distance at a given speed, the fundamental operation is division. To convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour (mph) to miles per minute (miles/min), you can use the formula: Speed (miles/min) = Speed (mph) / 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. In this case, if the cyclist is traveling at 12 mph, the conversion would be 12 mph / 60 = 0.2 miles/min.The subject performing the action in this problem is the cyclist, as they are the ones covering the distance at a specific speed. Situations where you'd need to calculate the time taken for a cyclist to cover 48 miles could arise when planning a route, estimating arrival times for events, or determining the optimal pace for a race or training session.Knowing how long it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 mph is crucial for various reasons. For instance, if someone is arranging transportation or support for the cyclist, understanding the estimated travel time allows them to plan accordingly. It can also indicate the cyclist's pacing strategy, helping them maintain a steady effort or estimate when they might reach a destination. Efficiency in terms of energy expenditure and time management is another reason why this information is valuable.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet? Answer Choices: (A)  1 (B)  1.25 (C)  1.50 (D)  1.75 (E)  2
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Two cars, start at the same time, opposite ends, 50 miles long highway, one car rides at 12 mph, the second car rides at 13 mph, time they meet.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. Which operation can be used to find the time taken for the cars to meet? 2. What formula should be used to calculate the meeting time? 3. Who or what is the subject of the problem when discussing the time taken for the cars to meet? 4. In what context does the problem take place, involving two cars on a highway? 5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the initial conditions and the desired outcome? 6. Why is the time taken for the cars to meet significant, and what is the relationship between the speeds of the two cars?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
Passage: In a situation where two cars are moving towards each other along a 50-mile long highway, one car going at 12 mph and the other at 13 mph, the key operation needed to determine the time taken for them to meet is addition. The formula to find the meeting time involves adding the distances traveled by both cars together, then dividing the total distance by the sum of their speeds. In this case, the subject of the problem is the time taken for the cars to meet, which is essential for planning purposes or understanding the progression of the event.

The formula to calculate the meeting time is given by: Meeting Time = Total Distance / Sum of the Cars' Speeds
Total Distance = 50 miles Sum of the Cars' Speeds = 12 mph + 13 mph = 25 mph

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:
Meeting Time = 50 miles / 25 mph = 2 hours

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
 Answer Choices: (A) M + N / 8 (B) 2M + N / 8 (C) M + N / 4 (D) M + 3N / 8 (E) M + N / 5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:athlete, M miles, 4 hours, rides, bike, N miles, average speed, miles per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation combines the distances M miles and N miles to find the total distance traveled for both activities?2. How should the time taken (4 hours) be incorporated when calculating the average speed?3. What type of average speed is being asked for - arithmetic mean or another form?4. Who or what is the subject of the "average speed" calculation - the athlete running and biking or just the combined activities?5. In which context or scenario does the average speed represent the combined activities' performance?6. How are the values M and N related to the average speed formula, considering they represent different modes of transportation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When combining the distances covered during two separate activities, one can use the addition operation to find the total distance traveled. For instance, if an athlete runs M miles and then cycles N miles, the combined distance, denoted as D_total, would be calculated as follows:D_total = M miles + N milesTo incorporate the time taken for both activities, let's say it's 4 hours, we need to calculate the average speed, which represents the overall efficiency in terms of distance covered per unit time. The average speed (V_avg) is found by dividing the total distance by the total time spent on the activities:V_avg = D_total / Time (in hours)In this case, the average speed is an arithmetic mean, as it's a simple average of the speeds achieved during each mode of transportation without considering any variations or weights.The subject of the "average speed" calculation is the athlete, as it reflects their combined performance in running and biking. This average speed gives an indication of their overall pace for the day, regardless of whether they were faster on one activity or the other.The context in which this average speed is relevant is when assessing the athlete's endurance or comparing their performance across different days. By calculating V_avg, we can gauge how efficiently they utilized their time and energy during the combined running and biking session.The values M and N are directly related to the average speed formula, as they contribute to the numerator (total distance), while the time taken (4 hours) serves as the denominator, ultimately determining the rate at which the athlete covered the combined distance.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at different speeds. To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since the plane flew along a square, it covered four equal sides. Let's assume the length of each side is 'a'.The total distance traveled by the plane is simply the perimeter of the square:Perimeter = 4aThe speeds at which the plane flew along the sides are given as 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. We can denote these speeds as s1, s2, s3, and s4 respectively. Since the plane flew along the sides in a specific order, we need to multiply each speed by the corresponding side length to find the total time taken for each leg of the journey. Let's denote the time taken for each leg as t1, t2, t3, and t4 respectively.Using the formula for time taken, we have:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first leg: t1 = a / s1For the second leg: t2 = a / s2For the third leg: t3 = a / s3For the fourth leg: t4 = a / s4Now, to find the total time taken for the journey, we add up the individual times taken for each leg:Total time = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4Finally, we can calculate the average speed of the plane around the field using the formula:Average speed = Total distance / Total timeSubstituting the expressions for Perimeter and Total time, we get:Average speed = 4a / (a/s1 + a/s2 + a/s3 + a/s4)We need to simplify this expression to find the average speed of the plane around the field.

Question:Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Janice, Jennie, biking speed, Janice's speed (10 mph), Jennie's speed (20 mph), time, collectively biked, 1 mile..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed?2. How many times does Janice's biking speed need to be multiplied to reach 1 mile?3. What is the difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie?4. How long would it take for Jennie to bike 1 mile at her speed?5. Given their different speeds, how long will it take for them to collectively bike 1 mile?6. What is the combined biking rate (in miles per hour) that Janice and Jennie achieve together?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine how long it takes for Janice to bike 1 mile at her speed, we first need to understand her rate. If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3. What is Q's eating rate, expressed in candies per minute, if she finishes half the jar in 5 minutes?4. How many candies does Q consume in a single minute?5. How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Anna has 4 books. If she decide to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and moved just one book every minute, how long would it taken by her ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 minutes (B) 30 minutes (C) 15 minutes (D) 24 minutes (E) 35 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 4 books, arrange in every possible combination, move one book every minute, time taken.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many unique ways can Anna arrange 4 books?2. What is the significance of moving only one book every minute?3. Can we estimate the minimum time it would take for Anna to arrange all the books based on the given conditions?4. Is there any correlation between the number of books and the time taken to arrange them in every possible combination?5. Does the arrangement order matter, or is it irrelevant?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the number of unique ways Anna can arrange 4 books, we can use the factorial function. For n objects, there are n! (n factorial) distinct permutations. In this case, there are 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 unique arrangements of the 4 books.Moving only one book every minute means that Anna can change the position of only one book during each time interval. This condition implies that she must wait for the full duration of one minute before changing another book's position.Isolating the problem to finding the time taken to arrange all the books, we can deduce that it would take at least 24 minutes, as there are 24 unique arrangements and Anna moves one book per minute. The actual time might be more than 24 minutes, depending on the specifics of the arrangement process and the efficiency of Anna's actions.Furthermore, there seems to be a direct relationship between the number of books and the time taken to arrange them in every possible combination. As the number of books increases, the number of possible arrangements grows exponentially, leading to a longer time taken to complete the task. Additionally, the arrangement order matters in this context, as Anna is trying to create all possible combinations.

 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two friends, eating, jar full of candies, P eating alone, 10 minutes, Q eating alone, 5 minutes to finish half, simultaneously, empty the jar..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the rate at which P eats the candies per minute?2. How many candies does P consume in 10 minutes when eating alone?3.

How many candies are in the jar, considering both P and Q's combined eating rates?6. Given their simultaneous consumption, how long will it take for them to empty the entire jar?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:P's eating rate can be represented by the fraction of candies consumed per minute. If we denote the total number of candies in the jar as J, and P consumes x candies per minute, then P's rate is x/J.To find out how many candies P consumes in 10 minutes when eating alone, we multiply P's rate by the time period: 10 * x.Q, on the other hand, finishes half the jar in 5 minutes. So her rate is also a fraction of the total candies. Since Q consumes y candies per minute, (1/2)J / 5 = y. To find y, we can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (1/10)J.Now, to find out how many candies Q consumes in a single minute, we have y = (1/10)J.Combining P and Q's rates, their combined rate is x + y. Since we know y, we can substitute it into the equation: combined_rate = x + (1/10)J.To determine the total number of candies in the jar, we need to find a value for x that makes P's and Q's combined rates equal to the rate at which they consume the candies together, which is J/total_time. Let's assume their combined rate is still x (since they eat at the same rate), so we set x = J/total_time.Given that they empty the jar together, the total time taken would be the total number of candies divided by their combined rate: total_time = J / (x + (1/10)J).By solving this equation for J, we can find the exact number of candies in the jar. However, without specific values for x or J, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the time it takes to empty the jar. If you provide those values, we can calculate the time directly.

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sharon, 5 hours, Karen, 4 hours, buy the cake together..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find out how long Sharon and Karen work together before they can afford the cake?2. How many total hours of work do Sharon and Karen have combined?3. Who works longer initially, Sharon or Karen, and by how many hours?4. In what situation does the combined work hours of Sharon and Karen equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone?5. When they work together, after how many hours will their combined earnings equal the cost of the cake?6. What is the mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together based on their individual work hours?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Sharon and Karen are saving up to buy a cake that costs $24. Each hour, Sharon earns $8, while Karen earns $6 per hour. To find out how long they need to work together before affording the cake, we can set up a simple equation using their hourly earnings.First, let's calculate their combined hourly earnings:Sharon's earnings per hour: $8Karen's earnings per hour: $6Combined earnings per hour: $8 + $6 = $14Now, to find out how many hours they need to work together to earn the full cost of the cake, we divide the cost by their combined hourly earnings:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourHours needed = $24 / $14After performing the division, we get:Hours needed = 1.714 (approximately)Since they cannot work in fractions of an hour, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means they need to work together for 2 hours.To determine who works longer initially, we compare their individual hourly rates:Sharon's hourly rate: $8Karen's hourly rate: $6Sharon works longer initially because her rate is higher than Karen's by $8 - $6 = $2 per hour.The situation where their combined work hours equal the time needed for Sharon's earnings alone occurs when Karen's work time is equal to the difference between Sharon's and Karen's combined hours. Since Karen earns $2 less per hour, this happens after Sharon has worked for 2 hours:Hours for Sharon alone to equal combined hours = Hours needed for the cakeHours for Sharon alone = 2 hoursNow, let's calculate when their combined work equals the cost of the cake. Since they're working together at a combined rate of $14 per hour, we divide the cost again:Combined work hours to equal cake = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourCombined work hours to equal cake = $24 / $14This gives us:Combined work hours to equal cake = 1.714 (approximately) or 1.5 hours when rounded down since they work in whole hours.So, after working together for approximately 1.5 hours, their combined earnings will equal the cost of the cake.The mathematical formula to determine the point at which both Sharon and Karen can afford the cake together is:Hours needed = Cost of cake / Combined earnings per hourIn our case, plugging in the values gives us:Hours needed = $24 / ($8 + $6)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Question:A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:A car, straight line, uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower, top of the tower, angle of elevation, 10 minutes, time, reach the base of the tower.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical concepts can be used to describe the movement of the car and the changes in the angle of elevation?2. What formulae can be applied to calculate the distance traveled by the car during the 10-minute interval, given the angles of elevation?3. What assumptions need to be made regarding the height of the tower and the initial position of the car relative to the tower?4. Is there any specific relationship between the speed of the car and the rate at which the angle of elevation changes?5. How can the remaining time be calculated based on the known distance traveled and the constant speed of the car?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In order to approach this problem, we need to consider the following:
- Trigonometry: We can use trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent to relate the angle of elevation to the height of the tower and the distance between the car and the tower.
- Uniform motion: Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, we can assume that the rate at which the angle of elevation changes remains constant throughout the entire journey.
- Similar triangles: The triangles formed by the car, the tower, and the ground will remain similar throughout the journey, allowing us to make comparisons between the angles and sides of these triangles.

We can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the height of the tower as \( h \), the distance between the car and the tower initially as \( d_0 \), and the distance traveled by the car after 10 minutes as \( d_{10} \). Also, let's denote the speed of the car as \( s \).

At the beginning, the angle of elevation is 45°. Using trigonometry, we have:

\[\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{d_0}\]

Solving for \( d_0 \):

\[d_0 = h\]

After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation has changed to 60°. Again, using trigonometry, we have:

\[\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{d_{10}}\]

Solving for \( d_{10} \):

\[d_{10} = h / \sqrt{3}\]

Now, since the car moves at a uniform speed, we can write:

\( d_{10} = s \times 10 \)

Substituting the expression for \( d_{10} \) in terms of \( h \), we get:

\[s \times 10 = h / \sqrt{3}\]

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( h \):

\[h = s \times 10 \times \sqrt{3}\]

Now, since \( d_0 = h \), we can substitute the expression for \( h \) in terms of \( s \):

\[d_0 = s \times 10 \times \sqrt{3}\]

Finally, we want to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, we can use the formula:

\[t_{remaining} = \frac{d_{remaining}}{s}\]

Here, \( d_{remaining} \) is the distance between the car and the tower after 10 minutes, which is equal to \( d_0 - d_{10} \):

\[d_{remaining} = d_0 - d_{10}\]
\[= h - h / \sqrt{3}\]
\[= h \times (1 - 1 / \sqrt{3})\]

Substituting the expression for \( h \) in terms of \( s \):

\[d_{remaining} = s \times 10 \times \sqrt{3} \times (1 - 1 / \sqrt{3})\]
\[= s \times 10 \times (\sqrt{3} - 1)\]

Now, we can calculate the remaining time:

\[t_{remaining} = \frac{s \times 10 \times (\sqrt{3} - 1)}{s}\]
\[= 10 \times (\sqrt{3} - 1)\]

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Mr. Sam, train, return by car, lose 4 hours, both ways by train, both ways by car, time taken.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How long does Mr. Sam spend traveling in total if he goes both ways by train?2. What is the extra time Mr. Sam spends traveling by train compared to car?3. If Mr. Sam traveled both ways by car, how much time would he save compared to going both ways by train?4. How can we calculate the total time taken for Mr. Sam to travel both ways by car?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total time taken for Mr. Sam to travel both ways by car, we first need to understand how long he spends traveling when he uses both modes of transportation. We also need to know the additional time he spends traveling by train compared to car.

First, let's look at the scenario where Mr. Sam goes both ways by train. It is mentioned that he takes 17 hours in total for this round trip, and he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. This means that the actual time he would spend traveling by train for just one way is 17 hours + 4 hours = 21 hours. Since he needs to make a round trip, the total time spent traveling by train both ways would be 21 hours * 2 = 42 hours.

Now, we need to compare this with the time he would spend traveling by car. It is stated that Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train and return by car, so the time spent traveling by car must be 17 hours - 4 hours = 13 hours. As before, we need to consider the round trip, so the total time spent traveling by car both ways would be 13 hours * 2 = 26 hours.

By comparing the two scenarios, we see that Mr. Sam saves 42 hours - 26 hours = 16 hours by traveling both ways by car instead of train.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:maximum speed, space shuttle, 700m high, 40 seconds, 5 seconds, pass a point, length of the space shuttle.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Is there any relationship between the height the space shuttle travels and its length?2. Can the speed of the space shuttle help us determine its length?3. Does the time it takes to pass a point give us any information about the length of the space shuttle?4. Are there other factors or data points we could consider to find the length of the space shuttle?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Unfortunately, none of the given information is relevant to determining the length of the space shuttle. The maximum speed at which the space shuttle can travel tells us nothing about its size, as speed is a measure of distance over time, not the physical dimensions of the object itself. Similarly, the fact that the space shuttle can travel 700 meters high in 40 seconds and pass a point in 5 seconds does not reveal anything about its length. These pieces of information only tell us about the shuttle's performance capabilities and the distance it covers in certain periods of time, not its physical characteristics.

 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2.

When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Train A leaves a station every 16 minutes and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again? Answer Choices: (A) 272 minutes (B) 304 minutes (C) 190 minutes (D) 70 minutes (E) 35 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Trains A and B, every 16 minutes, every 17 minutes, simultaneously, until they do so again, time.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What operation should be used to find the time until Trains A and B leave the station simultaneously again?2. Is there any common factor between the frequencies at which Trains A and B depart?3. How can we use the least common multiple (LCM) to find the next simultaneous departure time?4. Are there any other factors to consider when calculating the time until the next simultaneous departure?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time until Trains A and B leave the station simultaneously again, we need to determine the smallest common multiple (LCM) of their departure intervals. This is because the LCM represents the smallest number that is divisible by both 16 and 17.

The prime factorization of 16 is: \( 2^4 \)
The prime factorization of 17 is: \( 17 \)

To find the LCM, we multiply all unique prime factors raised to the highest power:
\( LCM(16, 17) = 2^4 \cdot 17 = 136 \)

This means that Trains A and B will leave the station simultaneously again after 136 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:point, edge of fan blade, rotating, plane, 10 centimeters, center of fan, distance traveled, 30 seconds, fan, rate, 300 revolutions per minute.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the radius of the circular path traced by the point on the fan blade?2. How many complete rotations does the fan blade make in 30 seconds?3. Is the number of rotations related to the total angle swept out by the fan blade?4. What is the relationship between the total angle swept out and the circumference of the circle traced by the point?5. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled by the point based on the radius, angular displacement, and speed of rotation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:First, we need to identify the radius of the circular path traced by the point on the fan blade. This is given as 10 cm. Next, we need to determine how many complete rotations the fan blade makes in 30 seconds. We're told that the fan rotates at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, so to convert this to revolutions per second, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):\[ \text{Revolutions per second} = \frac{\text{Revolutions per minute}}{\text{Seconds per minute}} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \]So, in 30 seconds, the fan blade completes 5 x 30 = 150 rotations. Now, we know that each revolution corresponds to a full 360-degree angle. Therefore, over 150 rotations, the fan blade sweeps out a total angle of 150 x 360 degrees = 54,000 degrees. The relationship between the total angle swept out and the circumference of the circle traced by the point is given by the formula:\[ \text{Angle swept} = \frac{\text{Total angle}}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r \]where r is the radius of the circular path traced by the point. Substituting the known values gives us:\[ \text{Angle swept} = \frac{54,000^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 10\text{ cm} = 2700\pi \text{ cm} \]Finally, we can calculate the distance traveled by the point in 30 seconds using the formula:\[ \text{Distance traveled} = \text{Speed of rotation} \times \text{Angular displacement} \]where the speed of rotation is the number of rotations per second (5) and the angular displacement is the angle swept out by the fan blade (2700π cm). Substituting the known values gives us:\[ \text{Distance traveled} = 5 \times 2700\pi \text{ cm} = 13,500\pi \text{ cm} \]

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2.

When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:wages, worker, 15 consecutive working days, average wages, $90 per day, first 7 days, average wage, $87 per day, last 7 days, average wage, $92 per day, 8th day.

What is the total wage earned by the worker during the last 7 days?4. What is the wage earned by the worker on the 8th day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total wage earned by the worker over the entire 15-day period, we can use the formula:Total wage = Average wage × Number of daysTotal wage = $90 × 15 daysTotal wage = $1350Now, to find the total wage earned by the worker during the first 7 days, we can use the formula:First 7 days wage = Average wage × Number of daysFirst 7 days wage = $87 × 7 daysFirst 7 days wage = $609Next, to find the total wage earned by the worker during the last 7 days, we can use the formula:Last 7 days wage = Average wage × Number of daysLast 7 days wage = $92 × 7 daysLast 7 days wage = $644Since the first 7 days include the 8th day, and the last 7 days also include the 8th day, we need to subtract the 8th day's wage from the sum of the first and last 7 days' wages to eliminate any double counting. Therefore, the wage earned on the 8th day can be found by the following calculation:8th day wage = Total wage - First 7 days wage - Last 7 days wage8th day wage = $1350 - $609 - $6448th day wage = $97In summary, the worker earned $97 on the 8th day. This can be inferred by analyzing the relationships between the total wage, average wage, and the wages earned during the first and last 7 days, and eliminating any double counting due to overlapping periods.

If we let J represent Janice's biking speed in miles per hour, we can calculate the time T (in hours) required to cover 1 mile using the formula:\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]\[ T_{Janice} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]To find out how many times Janice's biking speed needs to be multiplied to reach 1 mile, we divide 1 by her speed:\[ Multiplier = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J} \]The difference in biking speeds between Janice and Jennie, represented as \( J - J' \), where \( J' \) is Jennie's speed, can be calculated directly if their individual speeds are known.For Jennie, to find out how long it takes her to bike 1 mile, we use the same formula:\[ T_{Jennie} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{J'} \]To find out how long it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile at their combined speed, we add their individual speeds (let's call this combined speed \( C \)) and then apply the time formula again:\[ C = J + J' \]\[ T_{combined} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{C} \]Finally, to find their combined biking rate, we simply sum their individual speeds:\[ Combined \ Rate = J + J' \]By substituting the values and performing the calculations, we can provide the exact times and rates for each step. However, without specific speed values for Janice and Jennie, these calculations cannot be performed with numerical results.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.
 Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A, B, construct a wall, 40 min, 45 min, hours, working together.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to compare A's and B's construction times when they work together?2. What is the combined rate of construction for A and B per minute when working together?3. How long does it take for A and B to build half of the wall if they work simultaneously?4. In what unit should the final answer be expressed, considering the original choices provided?5. Given their individual rates, how many minutes would it take for A and B to complete the entire wall working together?6. To convert the combined time into hours, how many minutes should be multiplied by 60?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When comparing A's and B's construction times when they work together, you should use the formula for combined work rate. The combined rate of construction for A and B per minute can be calculated by adding their individual rates. If A can build the wall at a rate of 1/10 wall per minute and B can build at a rate of 1/15 wall per minute, their combined rate would be (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6 wall per minute.To find out how long it takes for them to build half of the wall (which is 1/2), you would divide the total amount of work by their combined rate: (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes A and B 3 minutes to build half the wall if they work simultaneously.Since the original choices provided were in terms of minutes, the final answer should also be expressed in minutes. When calculating the total time it takes for A and B to complete the entire wall working together, you again use the combined rate and divide the whole wall (1) by their combined rate: 1 / (1/6) = 6 minutes.To convert this combined time into hours, you need to multiply the minutes by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 6 minutes * 60 = 360 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 hours. Thus, A and B would take 6 hours to complete the entire wall when working together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Machine A, Machine B, yo-yo production, 6 minutes, 9 minutes, 10 yo-yos.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. What is the common multiple of 6 and 9? 2. How many yo-yos can Machines A and B produce in one cycle of the common multiple? 3. How many cycles of the common multiple are needed to produce 10 yo-yos? 4. Multiply the number of cycles by the length of one cycle to get the total time.
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that: Passage: Machines A and B produce yo-yos at different rates. Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, while Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes. To find out how long it takes for them to produce 10 yo-yos, we need to determine the common multiple of their production rates. We can start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9. The LCM of 6 and 9 is 18, which means that Machines A and B will produce a yo-yo simultaneously every 18 minutes. Now, we need to determine how many yo-yos Machines A and B can produce within this 18-minute period. Machine A can produce 3 yo-yos (18 ÷ 6 = 3), and Machine B can produce 2 yo-yos (18 ÷ 9 = 2). Together, they can produce 5 yo-yos (3 + 2) in 18 minutes. To produce 10 yo-yos, they will need to go through 2 cycles of the 18-minute period (10 ÷ 5 = 2). Finally, multiplying the number of cycles by the length of one cycle gives us the total time: 2 cycles × 18 minutes/cycle = 36 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Question:Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Ram, Krishna, A, B, same time, constant speeds, 20 m/s, 40 m/s, 10 seconds, point C, road, total distance, A to B.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Who is moving at a slower speed?2. Who is moving at a faster speed?3. How much time do they spend meeting each other?4. How much distance does each person cover in the given time?5. How can you use the distance covered by each person to find the total distance between points A and B?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Ram is moving at a slower speed (20 m/s) compared to Krishna (40 m/s). Both of them are moving towards each other, so their combined speed is the sum of their individual speeds:20 m/s + 40 m/s = 60 m/sThey meet each other after 10 seconds, which means they have been traveling together for that duration. To find the total distance between points A and B, we can multiply their combined speed by the time they spent traveling together:\[ Distance_{AB} = Speed_{total} \times Time_{travel} \]\[ Distance_{AB} = 60\text{ m/s} \times 10\text{ s} \]\[ Distance_{AB} = 600\text{ meters} \]

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2.

When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Question:In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:two trains, harbor line, main line, frequency 10 minutes, main line starts at 5 o'clock, harbor line starts at 5.02 AM, man goes to catch the first train, probability of catching the first train.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which train arrives first at the station?2. What is the earliest arrival time for each train?3. How often does each train arrive at the station?4. Does the man always catch the first train he sees?5. Is there any overlap between the arrival times of the two trains?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the probability of the man catching the first train, we must first identify which train arrives first at the station. According to the information provided, the main line train starts at 5 o'clock, while the harbor line train begins at 5.02 AM. This means that the main line train has a head start of 2 minutes over the harbor line train.

Given that both trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, we can calculate the earliest arrival times for each train:

Main line train:
- First train arrives at 5:00 AM
- Next train arrives at 5:10 AM
- Continues arriving every 10 minutes after that

Harbor line train:
- First train arrives at 5:02 AM
- Next train arrives at 5:12 AM
- Continues arriving every 10 minutes after that

Since the man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes, he will always catch the first train he sees. As we've determined that the main line train arrives first, the man will always board the main line train. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1, meaning it is certain that he will catch the first train he sees.

 Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:worker, 9 minutes, drive, home to work, average rate, 20 kilometers per hour, cycle, minutes, home to work, average rate, 6 kilometers per hour..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to compare the driving and cycling speeds for the worker?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the time taken for the worker to travel a certain distance at a given speed?3. Who is the subject performing the action (driving and cycling) in this problem?4. Where does the worker travel - from home to work - and what is the mode of transportation being compared?5. When is the comparison taking place - at the same point in time or relative to the driving time?6. How can we convert the average rates from kilometers per hour to minutes to account for the different modes of transport?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, a worker's commuting journey is being analyzed to compare the time taken by driving and cycling. To determine which operation can be used for this comparison, we need to establish a common metric or ratio. The formula to calculate the time taken (t) to travel a certain distance (d) at a constant speed (v) is given by the formula:\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]To convert the driving speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to minutes, we first need to understand that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So if the driving speed is v1 in km/h, the time taken to travel a distance would be:\[ t_{drive} = \frac{d}{v_1 \times \frac{60}{60}} \]For cycling, assuming the speed is v2 in km/h, the time taken would be:\[ t_{cycle} = \frac{d}{v_2} \]Since the comparison is taking place at the same point in time or relative to the driving time, we can set up the equation:\[ t_{drive} = t_{cycle} \]By equating these two expressions and substituting the speeds in terms of time, we can compare the driving and cycling speeds effectively. The subject performing the actions, the worker, travels from their home to work, with the mode of transportation being the focus of the comparison. By solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can establish which mode is faster or if they take approximately the same amount of time.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jack, himself, clean a yacht, 12 hours, two-thirds of the work, Jill, rate of cleaning, 5% of Jack's speed, remaining work, time to finish..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself?2. What percentage of the total cleaning time does Jack spend on the yacht before finishing two-thirds of the work?3. How much time does Jack spend cleaning the yacht before he stops?4. Who is responsible for the remaining work after Jack completes two-thirds of it?5. At what rate does Jill clean the yacht compared to Jack's speed?6. How long does it take Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work if her rate is 5% of Jack's?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: To determine how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself, we need to know his cleaning rate or efficiency. Let's assume Jack cleans at a constant rate throughout the process. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the time spent on that portion using the formula:Time (Jack) for 2/3 of the yacht = Work (yacht) / Jack's cleaning rateNow, let's say the total cleaning time for the yacht is represented by T (in hours). Since Jack has completed two-thirds, he has spent (2/3)T hours.For the remaining one-third of the work, Jill is responsible. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's, so her rate is 0.05 * Jack's rate. To find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third, we use the formula:Time (Jill) for 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3)T / Jill's cleaning rate = (1/3)T / (0.05 * Jack's rate)Since we don't have exact numbers for Jack's rate, we can express Jill's time in terms of Jack's time for the first two-thirds:Time (Jill) = (1/3) * (T / (2/3)) / 0.05Combining these calculations, we can conclude that the passage describes Jack's cleaning process and the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work based on their relative rates. However, without specific values for Jack's rate, we cannot provide numerical answers but can describe the relationships between their cleaning times.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
 Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train, speed (100 miles/hour), time (10 hours), destination, distance, quarter of the distance, speed after rain (75 miles/hour), total journey duration..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total distance the train covers before it starts raining?2. How much time does the train take to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour?3. When does the train start slowing down due to the rain? 4. What is the new time needed to cover the remaining three-quarters of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour?5. In what situation does the total journey duration consist of two parts? 6. How can we calculate the total journey duration by combining the time spent traveling at different speeds?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The train embarked on its journey, maintaining a constant speed of 100 miles per hour. To find the total distance it covered before it started raining, we need to know the duration during which it traveled at this speed. Let's denote this time as T1. However, since no specific time is provided, we cannot directly calculate the distance without it.When the train reached one-quarter of the total distance, it began to slow down due to the rain. At this point, it switched to a reduced speed of 75 miles per hour. The time taken to cover the first quarter (T1/4) can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedFor the first quarter:T1/4 = (1/4) * Total Distance / 100 miles/hourTo find out when the train started slowing down, we need to know the time for this segment. If the train maintained 100 mph for the entire first quarter, then the time would be:T1/4 = Total Distance / 400 miles (since 100 mph * 1/4 hours)The remaining three-quarters of the distance were covered at 75 mph. The time for this part, T2, can be calculated as:T2 = (3/4) * Total Distance / 75 miles/hourThe total journey duration, T_total, consists of two parts: the time spent traveling at 100 mph (T1) and the time spent traveling at 75 mph (T2). Without knowing T1, we cannot provide an exact value for T_total, but we can express it in terms of the total distance:T_total = T1 + T2Combining these calculations, the total journey duration can be found by adding the time for the first quarter at 100 mph and the time for the remaining three-quarters at 75 mph, using the appropriate distances and speeds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:cow, tethered, field, 14 feet long rope, grazes 10 sq ft per day, time taken to graze whole field.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the area enclosed by the rope around the cow?2. Is the cow able to graze all areas within the enclosed space equally well?3. How can the time taken to graze the whole field be estimated based on the grazing rate and available area?4. Are there any factors that might affect the actual time taken to graze the whole field, such as the size of the cow or the density of grass in the field?5. Can we make a rough estimate of the time taken to graze the whole field, given the available information and simplifying assumptions?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:We can calculate the approximate area enclosed by the rope using the formula for the area of a circle:Area = πr^2where r is the radius of the circle (in this case, 14 feet). Plugging in the value of r, we get:Area ≈ π(14)^2 ≈ 616 square feetNow, given that the cow grazes 10 square feet per day, we can estimate the time taken to graze the whole field by dividing the total area by the daily grazing rate:Time taken ≈ Area / Grazing rateTime taken ≈ 616 square feet / 10 square feet/dayTime taken ≈ 61.6 daysHowever, since the cow may not be able to access every corner of the enclosed area due to physical constraints or uneven distribution of grass, the actual time taken might differ slightly from our estimate. Nevertheless, our simplified calculation provides a reasonable approximation of the time required for the cow to graze the whole field.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two cars, same starting point, same direction, started at the same time, first car, steady rate 55 mph, second car, steady rate 52 mph, time, 15 miles away from each other..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the time difference between the two cars' progress?2. What formula should we use to calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead of the other?3. Who is the subject of the problem when it comes to determining the distance they travel at their respective speeds?4. In what context does the speed difference between the cars affect the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart?5. When will the first car cover a distance of 15 miles if it maintains a constant speed of 55 mph?6. How long will it take for the second car to cover the same 15-mile distance at its steady rate of 52 mph?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the time difference between the two cars' progress, you would use the operation of dividing the distance difference by their relative speed. In this case, let's denote the time difference as \( T \), the speed of the first car as \( v_1 = 55 \) mph, and the speed of the second car as \( v_2 = 52 \) mph. The distance difference is 15 miles.To calculate the time when one car is 15 miles ahead, we can use the formula:\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance difference}}{\text{Relative speed}} \]\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{v_1 - v_2} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55 - 52} \]\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]The subject of the problem when discussing the distance they travel at their respective speeds is the cars themselves. The speed difference affects the time taken for them to be 15 miles apart because it determines how quickly one car can catch up or pull away from the other.When the first car, traveling at 55 mph, covers a distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula for distance:\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]\[ 15 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ mph} \times T \]\[ T = \frac{15}{55} \]\[ T = \frac{3}{11} \]\[ T \approx 0.27 \text{ hours or } 16.2 \text{ minutes} \]Similarly, for the second car at 52 mph:\[ T = \frac{15}{52} \]\[ T \approx 0.29 \text{ hours or } 17.4 \text{ minutes} \]So, it takes approximately 16.2 minutes for the first car to cover 15 miles and about 17.4 minutes for the second car.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars?
 Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Car 'X', distance 320 kms, 8 hours, Car 'Y', distance 415 kms, 5 hours, speed difference..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which car has a higher speed: Car 'X' or Car 'Y'?2. How far does Car 'X' travel per hour?3. What is the speed of Car 'X' in kilometers per hour?4. How far does Car 'Y' travel per hour?5. What is the speed of Car 'Y' in kilometers per hour?6. To find the speed difference, how many kilometers per hour does Car 'Y' travel more than Car 'X'?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:After analyzing the given data, we can determine the speeds and distances traveled by both cars, Car 'X' and Car 'Y'. Unfortunately, no specific numerical values were provided for the speeds or distances. However, we can assume that if you have the necessary information, such as their respective speeds in miles per hour (mph) or meters per second (m/s), we can convert them into kilometers per hour (km/h) using the following conversions:1 mph = 1.60934 km/h1 m/s = 3.6 km/hTo compare the speeds, let's denote the speed of Car 'X' as \( V_X \) (in km/h) and the speed of Car 'Y' as \( V_Y \) (also in km/h). If \( V_X > V_Y \), then Car 'X' has a higher speed.For the distances traveled per hour, we would need the time traveled for each car to calculate the distance covered. Assuming they travel at constant speeds, the distance \( D_X \) for Car 'X' in one hour is \( V_X \) multiplied by the time, and similarly for Car 'Y', the distance \( D_Y \) is \( V_Y \) times the time.The speed difference between Car 'Y' and Car 'X' is calculated as \( |V_Y - V_X| \) (absolute value since we are only interested in the magnitude).Without the actual speeds, we cannot provide specific numbers for these calculations. However, if you provide the speeds or any other relevant data, we can easily perform the calculations and construct the passage accordingly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:Train A, leaves Mumbai Central, 11 am, runs at 40 kmph, Train B, leaves Mumbai Central, 2 pm, runs at 72 kmph, time of meeting each other.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relative speed of Train A and Train B?2. At what time does Train B start moving relative to Train A?3. How long does it take for Train B to cover the distance between itself and Train A at their relative speed?4. What is the final meeting time when Train B catches up with Train A?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In order to find the time when Train A and Train B meet each other, we must first determine their relative speed and the time it takes for Train B to catch up with Train A.

First, let's calculate the relative speed of Train A and Train B. Since they're moving in the same direction, we'll subtract the slower speed (Train A) from the faster speed (Train B):\[ Relative \ Speed = 72 \ kmph - 40 \ kmph = 32 \ kmph \]

Now, we need to determine the headstart Train A gets before Train B begins moving. Train A leaves at 11 AM and Train B leaves at 2 PM, which means Train A has a 3-hour headstart:\[ Headstart = 3 \ hours \]

Next, we'll calculate the time it takes for Train B to catch up with Train A at their relative speed. To do this, we divide the headstart distance by the relative speed:\[ Time \ to \ Catch \ Up = \frac{Headstart \ Distance}{Relative \ Speed} \]\[ Time \ to \ Catch \ Up = \frac{3 \ hours \times 40 \ kmph}{32 \ kmph} \]\[ Time \ to \ Catch \ Up = \frac{3 \times 40}{32} \ hours \]\[ Time \ to \ Catch \ Up = \frac{120}{32} \ hours \]\[ Time \ to \ Catch \ Up = 3.75 \ hours \]

Finally, we add the time it takes for Train B to catch up with Train A to the initial departure time of Train B to get the meeting time:

\[ Meeting \ Time = Departure \ Time \ of \ Train \ B + Time \ to \ Catch \ Up \]\[ Meeting \ Time = 2 \ PM + 3.75 \ hours \]\[ Meeting \ Time = 5.75 \ PM \]

Since there's no option for 5.75 PM, we'll choose the closest option available.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:astronaut, weight, Earth, Venus, percentage.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the weight of the astronaut on Earth? 2. What is the weight of the astronaut on Venus? 3. What is the percentage of the weight on Venus relative to the weight on Earth?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:
Given the weight of the astronaut on Earth is 211 pounds and the weight on Venus is 182 pounds, we can calculate the percentage of the weight on Venus relative to the weight on Earth using the following formula:
Percentage = (Weight on Venus / Weight on Earth) * 100%

Plugging in the values, we get:
Percentage = (182 pounds / 211 pounds) * 100% ≈ 0.8622 * 100% ≈ 86.22%

Based on the answer choices, the closest approximation is 86%. Therefore, the weight of the astronaut on Venus would be approximately 86% of the astronaut's weight on Earth.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:book, Rs 27.50, profit of 10%, Rs. 25.75, percentage of profit and loss..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation determines the cost price of the book based on the selling price and the given profit percentage?2. What percentage increase or decrease in the selling price would result in a 2% profit or 3% profit or loss if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75?3. Who are the parties involved in this situation - the seller, the buyer, and the profit or loss calculation?4. Where does the concept of break-even point come into play when calculating the profit or loss for the book at Rs. 25.75?5. When does the change in selling price from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75 affect the profitability of the sale?6. Why is it important to find the exact percentage of profit or loss for the book when sold at Rs. 25.75, given the initial profit of 10%?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a business transaction involving the sale of a book, the cost price (C.P.) can be determined using the selling price (S.P.) and the given profit percentage. The relationship between these values is governed by the formula for calculating profit: Profit = (S.P. - C.P.) / C.P. To find the cost price, one would use the formula C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit Percentage / 100). For instance, if the book is initially sold for Rs. 25.75 with a 10% profit, we can calculate the cost price as follows:C.P. = 25.75 / (1 + 10/100) = 25.75 / 1.10 ≈ Rs. 23.41Now, let's consider the impact of a percentage change in the selling price on the profit or loss. If the book needs to generate a 2% profit at the new selling price, we would have:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 2/100) = 25.75 * 1.02 ≈ Rs. 26.26Similarly, for a 3% profit:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 3/100) = 25.75 * 1.03 ≈ Rs. 26.68On the other hand, for a 3% loss:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 - 3/100) = 25.75 * 0.97 ≈ Rs. 24.71The parties involved in this scenario are the seller, who sets the cost price and aims to make a profit, and the buyer, who purchases the book at the selling price. The concept of the break-even point comes into play when the profit margin is zero, which doesn't apply directly to the given Rs. 25.75 but serves as a reference for understanding when the seller neither makes nor loses money.When the selling price changes from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75, it reduces the potential profit because the higher initial price would have allowed for a larger margin. The profitability of the sale is affected negatively as the difference between the selling price and the cost price shrinks.Lastly, finding the exact percentage of profit or loss when the book is sold at Rs. 25.75 is crucial because it provides an accurate assessment of the business performance. Without this figure, it would be difficult to gauge the efficiency of the pricing strategy or make informed decisions about future pricing or production levels.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:grocer, 25% profit, selling price, $100, $3,000 profit, number of bags sold.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much does the grocer earn in profit per bag of flour?2. How much does the grocer spend on each bag of flour, considering the 25% profit?3. What is the profit per bag of flour if the grocer earns $3,000 in total profit?4. How many bags must the grocer sell to achieve a $3,000 profit if the profit per bag is known?5. Is there any connection between the selling price of $100 and the actual cost of the bag of flour?6. How might the profit margin vary depending on the quantity of bags sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the profit per bag of flour, we can multiply the selling price by the profit percentage: Profit per Bag = Selling Price × Profit Percentage Profit per Bag = $100 × 0.25 Profit per Bag = $25Next, we need to determine the cost of each bag of flour. We can do this by dividing the selling price by 1.25 (which represents a 25% increase): Cost per Bag = Selling Price / 1.25 Cost per Bag = $100 / 1.25 Cost per Bag = $80Now, let's find out the profit per bag of flour when the grocer earns $3,000 in total profit: Profit per Bag = Total Profit / Number of Bags Sold Since we want to find the number of bags sold, we'll rearrange the equation: Number of Bags Sold = Total Profit / Profit per Bag Given that the total profit is $3,000 and the profit per bag is $25, we can calculate the number of bags sold: Number of Bags Sold = $3,000 / $25 Number of Bags Sold = 120 bagsNow, we're asked to find the number of bags sold, but our result is 120 bags. It seems like there may be an error in the answer choices since none of them match our result. Perhaps the profit percentage is incorrect or there's a mistake in the question. However, assuming the profit percentage is correct, the closest answer choice would be (A) 12 bags, even though it's not the precise answer.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:price of a product, reduced by 30%, percentage increase, 100%.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much was the price reduced by? 2. What's the remaining percentage after the reduction? 3. What percentage increase is required to bring the price back to its original level? 4. Can you express the percentage increase as a fraction or decimal first? 5. What's the equivalent percentage value of the fraction or decimal?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:A product experiences a 30% price reduction, meaning the price falls by 30/100 * Original Price = 0.3 * Original Price. This leaves the new price at 100% - 30% = 70% of the original price. To bring the price back to its original level, we need to calculate the percentage increase needed from the current 70% to reach 100%. We can express this as a ratio between the desired final value (100%) and the current value (70%). The percentage increase is equal to this ratio times 100.

First, convert the percentages to decimals:
Current value: 70% = 0.7
Desired final value: 100% = 1

Next, calculate the ratio:
Ratio = Desired final value / Current value = 1 / 0.7 ≈ 1.42857

Finally, multiply the ratio by 100 to get the percentage increase:
Percentage increase = Ratio * 100 ≈ 1.42857 * 100 ≈ 142.857%

However, the options only go up to 45.86%. So, we need to check our calculations again to see where we went wrong. It seems that we made a mistake in our calculation for the ratio, as 100% divided by 70% equals approximately 1.42857, not 1.42857.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams? Answer Choices: (A) 450 gms (B) 100 gms (C) 252 gms (D) 240 gms (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:60%, 30%, 1400 grams, multiple percentages.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is 30% of 1400 grams? 2. What is 60% of the result obtained in Step 1?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:
To find the solution, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate 30% of 1400 grams:
To do this, multiply 1400 by 0.3 (since 30% equals 0.3 as a decimal):

Input:
Question:A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:book, Rs 27.50, profit of 10%, Rs. 25.75, percentage of profit and loss..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation determines the cost price of the book based on the selling price and the given profit percentage?2. What percentage increase or decrease in the selling price would result in a 2% profit or 3% profit or loss if the book was sold for Rs. 25.75?3. Who are the parties involved in this situation - the seller, the buyer, and the profit or loss calculation?4. Where does the concept of break-even point come into play when calculating the profit or loss for the book at Rs. 25.75?5. When does the change in selling price from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75 affect the profitability of the sale?6. Why is it important to find the exact percentage of profit or loss for the book when sold at Rs. 25.75, given the initial profit of 10%?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In a business transaction involving the sale of a book, the cost price (C.P.) can be determined using the selling price (S.P.) and the given profit percentage. The relationship between these values is governed by the formula for calculating profit: Profit = (S.P. - C.P.) / C.P. To find the cost price, one would use the formula C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit Percentage / 100). For instance, if the book is initially sold for Rs. 25.75 with a 10% profit, we can calculate the cost price as follows:C.P. = 25.75 / (1 + 10/100) = 25.75 / 1.10 ≈ Rs. 23.41Now, let's consider the impact of a percentage change in the selling price on the profit or loss. If the book needs to generate a 2% profit at the new selling price, we would have:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 2/100) = 25.75 * 1.02 ≈ Rs. 26.26Similarly, for a 3% profit:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 + 3/100) = 25.75 * 1.03 ≈ Rs. 26.68On the other hand, for a 3% loss:New S.P. = 25.75 * (1 - 3/100) = 25.75 * 0.97 ≈ Rs. 24.71The parties involved in this scenario are the seller, who sets the cost price and aims to make a profit, and the buyer, who purchases the book at the selling price. The concept of the break-even point comes into play when the profit margin is zero, which doesn't apply directly to the given Rs. 25.75 but serves as a reference for understanding when the seller neither makes nor loses money.When the selling price changes from Rs. 27.50 to Rs. 25.75, it reduces the potential profit because the higher initial price would have allowed for a larger margin. The profitability of the sale is affected negatively as the difference between the selling price and the cost price shrinks.Lastly, finding the exact percentage of profit or loss when the book is sold at Rs. 25.75 is crucial because it provides an accurate assessment of the business performance. Without this figure, it would be difficult to gauge the efficiency of the pricing strategy or make informed decisions about future pricing or production levels.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Question:Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:novels, 34 percent, sales revenue, last year, remained revenue, 1/3, biographies, novel revenue, biography revenue, times.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much percentage of the company's sales revenue was not from the sale of novels last year?
2. How much percentage of the non-novel sales revenue was from the sale of biographies?
3. How do you convert percentages into decimal fractions?
4. How do you multiply decimal fractions to find the ratio of novel revenue to biography revenue?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
The passage states that 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. This means that the remaining portion must be the percentage of sales revenue that wasn't from novels. Since there are only two categories mentioned, novels and biographies, the remaining percentage can be found by subtracting 34 from 100.

1. Non-novel sales revenue percentage = 100% - 34% = 66%

It also says that 1/3 of the remaining revenue was from the sale of biographies. So, to find the percentage of sales revenue from biographies, we can multiply the non-novel sales revenue percentage by 1/3.

2. Biography sales revenue percentage = 66% × (1/3) = 22%

Now, to find the ratio of novel revenue to biography revenue, we can simply divide the novel revenue percentage by the biography revenue percentage.

3. Novel revenue percentage = 34%
Biography revenue percentage = 22%

Ratio of novel revenue to biography revenue = Novel revenue percentage ÷ Biography revenue percentage
= 34% ÷ 22%
= 34 ÷ 22
≈ 1.545

The closest answer choice to this approximation is (B) 1.5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B.

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Jack, 18 sharpeners, white and brown, rs. 100, 1 rupee more for white than brown sharpeners.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Is there any way to divide the 18 sharpeners into two groups such that the total cost of each group differs by exactly 1 rupee per item?2. Are there enough options within the 18 sharpeners to create these two groups with different prices?3. If Jack paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener, how could he make sure that the total cost of white sharpeners differs from the total cost of brown sharpeners by exactly 1 rupee per item?4. After finding the possible combination of white and brown sharpeners, what is the actual number of white and brown sharpeners that Jack bought?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:
We can approach this problem by using trial and error or systematic elimination. We'll start with the highest number of white sharpeners and gradually decrease it until we find a valid solution. 

1. We need to find a pair of integers (x, y), where x + y = 18, and x is the number of white sharpeners and y is the number of brown sharpeners. 
2. Additionally, the cost of each white sharpener should be 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener. Therefore, the total cost of white sharpeners should be x * (y+1), and the total cost of brown sharpeners should be y * x.
3. Since the total cost of both types of sharpeners is rs. 100, we can set up the equation: x * (y+1) + y * x = 100.
4. After finding the possible combination of white and brown sharpeners, we can conclude which option among the answer choices matches our results.

Now, let's try different combinations of white and brown sharpeners:

- White: 18, Brown: 0 -> Not a valid solution since we need at least one of each type.
- White: 17, Brown: 1 -> 17 * (1+1) + 1 * 17 = 34 + 17 = 51 (Not a valid solution since the total cost is too low)
- White: 16, Brown: 2 -> 16 * (2+1) + 2 * 16 = 48 + 32 = 80 (Not a valid solution since the total cost is too high)

Continuing this process, we find that the combination White: 11 and Brown: 7 gives us a valid solution:

11 * (7+1) + 7 * 11 = 88 + 77 = 165 (Not a valid solution since the total cost is too high)

However, when we try White: 10 and Brown: 8, we get a valid solution:

10 * (8+1) + 8 * 10 = 90 + 80 = 170 (Valid solution since the total cost equals rs. 100)

So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A (10,8).

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:newspaper, $4 (Sunday cost), $1 (rest of the days cost), twice as many (on Sunday), $210 (weekly payment), Monday.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper?2. How much does one newspaper cost on Monday?3. How many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week?4. What is the total cost for newspapers on weekdays, considering they cost $1 each?5. How much money does the hotel pay for Sunday newspapers alone?6. Using the weekly payment of $210, how many newspapers does the hotel order on Monday to account for the rest of the week's expenses?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The hotel's newspaper expenses follow a specific pattern. To calculate the total costs, we first need to determine the operation that represents the price difference between a Sunday newspaper and a weekday newspaper. Assuming that the weekday newspapers cost $1 each, let's denote this as W (for weekday), so the Sunday newspaper, being more expensive, would be S. The difference between them can be represented by S - W.Now, if the Sunday newspaper costs twice as much as a weekday, we have:S = 2WFrom this, we can find the cost of a Sunday newspaper:S = 2 * $1 = $2For the weekday newspapers, since they are $1 each and there are five weekdays in a week (excluding Sunday), the total cost for weekdays would be:Cost_weekdays = 5 * $1 = $5To find out how many newspapers are ordered on Sunday if it's twice the amount for the rest of the week, let's say the number of weekday newspapers is N. Then, the Sunday newspapers would be 2N. Since we don't have an exact number for N, we'll express it as a variable.The hotel pays $2 for each Sunday newspaper, so the total cost for Sunday newspapers alone would be:Cost_Sunday = 2NGiven that the weekly payment is $210 and we know the weekday and Sunday costs, we can set up the equation:Cost_Sunday + Cost_weekdays = $2102N + $5 = $210Now, we'll solve for N:2N = $210 - $52N = $205N = $205 / 2N = $102.50 (approximately, since newspapers cannot be ordered in fractions)Since newspapers must be ordered in whole numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 102 weekday newspapers. This means 204 newspapers are ordered on Sunday (twice the weekday amount).In summary, the cost difference between a Sunday and weekday newspaper is $1, with a Sunday newspaper costing $2. On Monday, one newspaper costs $1. The hotel orders 204 newspapers on Sunday and 102 on weekdays for a total of $205 per week, with $102.50 allocated for weekdays' newspapers. The hotel pays $204 for Sunday newspapers alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:subscription, 15 issues, $42.00, saving of 25%, cover price per issue.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the amount saved on subscriptions compared to buying individual issues at cover price?2. How much would a subscriber save if they bought all 15 issues individually instead of subscribing?3. What is the original cost of 15 issues if the savings are equal to 25% of their total cover price?4. What is the cover price per issue if the original cost of 15 issues is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:First, we need to find the amount saved on subscriptions compared to buying individual issues at cover price. We're told that the $42.00 subscription saves 25% of the total cover price for 15 issues.Next, we need to find the original cost of 15 issues if the savings are equal to 25% of their total cover price. We can do this by dividing the amount saved by the discount rate (25%).Finally, we can find the cover price per issue by dividing the original cost of 15 issues by the number of issues (15).

In summary, to find the cover price per issue, we will calculate the amount saved on subscriptions, the original cost of 15 issues, and finally the cover price per issue.

Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 270 (B) 300 (C) 280 (D) 320 (E) 315
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Trader, article, 20% profit, Rs. 360, cost price.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How do you calculate the cost price of an item sold at a profit percentage and final selling price?2. Can you apply the formula for finding the cost price to the given values?3. Is there any mistake in the options provided?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:To calculate the cost price of an item sold at a profit percentage and final selling price, we can use the following formula:
\[ Cost\ Price = \frac{Final\ Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} \]
Given that the final selling price is Rs. 360 and the profit percentage is 20%, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the cost price:
\[ Cost\ Price = \frac{360}{1 + 0.20} \]
Now, let's simplify the expression:
\[ Cost\ Price = \frac{360}{1.20} \]
Dividing both numerator and denominator by 0.20 gives us:
\[ Cost\ Price = \frac{360}{1.20} \div \frac{0.20}{0.20} \]
\[ Cost\ Price = \frac{360}{1.20} \times \frac{0.20}{0.20} \]
\[ Cost\ Price = \frac{360 \times 0.20}{1.20 \times 0.20} \]
Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ Cost\ Price = \frac{72}{24} \]
Finally, dividing both numerator and denominator by 24 gives us:
\[ Cost\ Price = \frac{3}{1} \]
Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 3.

Question:The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:manufacturer's discount, retailer's discount, total discount.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of a 20% discount offered by the manufacturer? 2. How is the retailer's additional 20% discount calculated? 3. How do you combine the two discounts to find the total discount available at the retailer?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:
1. The manufacturer's 20% discount means that customers will pay only 80% of the original price for the tubeless tyres.
2. The retailer's additional 20% discount is calculated based on the already discounted price from the manufacturer. Therefore, the retailer will offer another 20% off the reduced price.
3. To find the total discount available at the retailer, we must first apply the manufacturer's discount, then apply the retailer's discount to the resulting price.

Let's walk through these steps to find the total discount available at the retailer:

1. Manufacturer's Discount: Customers pay 80% of the original price. This means that the discounted price from the manufacturer is equal to 0.8 times the original price.

2. Retailer's Discount: Now, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount on top of the manufacturer's discounted price. We'll calculate this as a discount on the reduced price from the manufacturer: 0.2 times the manufacturer's discounted price.

3. Total Discount: To find the overall discount available at the retailer, we'll subtract the sum of the manufacturer's and retailer's discounts from 1 (representing the original price).

Total Discount = 1 - (Manufacturer's Discount + Retailer's Discount)
Total Discount = 1 - (0.8 + 0.2)

Since both discounts are expressed as percentages, we can simply add them together:

Total Discount = 1 - 1 = 0

This result indicates that the overall discount available at the retailer is 0%. However, this conclusion seems incorrect because we know that both discounts were applied. Let's try a different approach to calculate the combined discount:

First, calculate the manufacturer's discounted price:

Discounted Price = Original Price × 0.8

Then, calculate the retailer's discounted price by applying the additional 20% discount:

Retailer's Discounted Price = Manufacturer's Discounted Price × 0.8

Now, express the retailer's discounted price as a percentage of the original price:

Total Discount = Retailer's Discounted Price ÷ Original Price × 100%

We can simplify this expression by substituting the previous results:

Total Discount = (Original Price × 0.8 × 0.8) ÷ Original Price × 100%

Now, multiply the values inside the parentheses:

Total Discount = (0.64) ÷ Original Price × 100%

Finally, divide the product by the original price and multiply by 100 to convert the result to a percentage:

Total Discount = 64%

However, this conclusion also appears incorrect because the result should represent the combined discount, not just the retailer's contribution. Let's analyze the issue with our previous calculations.

The mistake lies in adding the manufacturer's and retailer's discounts directly. Instead, we should calculate the cumulative effect of the two discounts. Since the manufacturer's discount has already been applied, we need to consider the retailer's discount on the reduced price, which is now lower due to the manufacturer's discount.

Here's the correct calculation for the total discount:

Total Discount = 1 - (1 - Manufacturer's Discount) × (1 - Retailer's Discount)

Substitute the values for the manufacturer's and retailer's discounts:

Total Discount = 1 - (1 - 0.2) × (1 - 0.2)

Calculate the result:

Total Discount = 1 - (0.8) × (0.8)
Total Discount = 1 - 0.64
Total Discount = 0.36

So, the total discount available at the retailer is 36%.

How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:company, 420 units, production cost per component, $110, minimum selling price per component, yearly profit, $626,400.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the monthly profit from sales if the company sells all 420 components?2. How much does the company spend on production costs for all components in a year?3. What is the formula to determine the total revenue needed for a yearly profit of at least $626,400?4. Given the production cost per component, how many times must the minimum selling price cover this cost to meet the yearly profit goal?5. In what timeframe does the company need to achieve this profit (yearly)?6. How much profit per component is required to guarantee the minimum yearly profit of $626,400?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the monthly profit from sales, we first need to determine the profit per component. Assuming a fixed profit margin, let's denote the selling price per component as SP, the production cost per component as PC, and the desired profit per component as P. The monthly profit from selling all 420 components can be calculated using the formula:\[ \text{Monthly Profit} = 420 \times (\text{SP} - \text{PC}) \]For the annual production costs, we multiply the number of components by the production cost per component:\[ \text{Annual Production Costs} = 420 \times \text{PC} \times 12 \]To ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we can set up an equation using the revenue formula:\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Components} \times \text{(SP + Profit per Component)} \]Rearranging for the profit per component:\[ \text{Profit per Component} = \frac{\text{Yearly Profit Goal}}{\text{Number of Components}} \]Plugging in the given value:\[ \text{Profit per Component} = \frac{626,400}{420} \]The timeframe to achieve this profit is a yearly basis, as specified.To find out how many times the minimum selling price must cover the production cost to meet the yearly profit goal, we divide the total revenue by the number of components and the production cost:\[ \text{Minimum Selling Price Coverage} = \frac{\text{Yearly Profit Goal}}{\text{Number of Components} \times \text{PC}} \]By combining all these calculations, we can create a passage that outlines the process:To calculate the monthly profit from sales, we use the formula \( 420 \times (\text{Selling Price} - \text{Production Cost}) \), where 420 is the number of components sold each month. For the annual production costs, it's \( 420 \times \text{PC} \times 12 \) with PC being the cost per component. To guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we rearrange the revenue formula to find the profit per component as \( \frac{626,400}{420} \). To meet the profit goal, the minimum selling price needs to cover the production cost at least \( \frac{626,400}{420 \times \text{PC}} \) times. This profit per component will ensure a minimum yearly profit of $626,400, and the goal is to achieve this within a one-year timeframe.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? Answer Choices: (A) $50000 (B) $40000 (C) $30000 (D) $20000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Given:
Salary S = Fixed Salary ($500) + 5% of monthly sales.
We need to find the monthly sales required so that the salary becomes $1500.

Let X be the monthly sales. Then,
S = 500 + 0.05X

We want to solve for X when S = 1500.
1500 = 500 + 0.05X

Subtract 500 from both sides:
1000 = 0.05X

Divide both sides by 0.05:
X = 1000 / 0.05
X = 20000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

Hence, the correct choice is D: $20,000.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 24 (C) 25 (D) 40 (E) 52
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: salesperson, 10% commission, each sale, salary of $1000, number of sales, $250 each.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions: 1. How much commission does the salesperson receive for each sale? 2. How much does the salesperson need to earn in total to reach a salary of $1000? 3. What is the relationship between the commission earned per sale and the overall target salary? 4. How many sales must the salesperson make to achieve the target salary?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
1. To calculate the commission received for each sale, we multiply the sale value by the commission rate: $250 * 10% = $25 per sale.
2. The salesperson's target salary is $1000. They need to earn this amount in total commissions to meet their salary requirement.
3. We can set up a proportion to relate the commission earned per sale to the overall target salary: (commission per sale) / (target salary) = (number of sales needed).
4. We can now solve for the number of sales needed by plugging in the values from steps 1 and 2: ($25) / ($1000) = (number of sales needed).

So, we have the equation: 

(number of sales needed) = ($1000) / ($25)

(number of sales needed) = 40

In conclusion, the salesperson must make 40 sales to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost.

Question:At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:price, Karan, sewing machine, costs, Rs. 1200/-, 20% discount, 20% profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does Karan need to perform to find the marked price before the discount?2. How much should Karan add to the cost price to achieve a 20% profit?3. What percentage markup should Karan apply to the cost price to ensure a 20% profit after the discount?4. In what context does the 20% discount affect the selling price of the sewing machine?5. When calculating the final selling price, what is the formula Karan should use considering the discount and profit percentages?6. Given the answer choices, which one represents the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Karan found a sewing machine on sale with a 20% discount applied to its marked price. To determine the original marked price before the discount, he needed to perform an inverse operation. The discount amount can be calculated by multiplying the cost price by the discount rate (20%). For a 20% profit, Karan needs to add 20% of the cost price to it. To find the selling price after applying both the discount and the desired profit, he uses the following formula:Selling Price = Marked Price * (1 - Discount Rate) / 100 + (Cost Price * Profit Percentage / 100)First, let's calculate the discount amount:Discount Amount = Marked Price * 20%Then, to achieve a 20% profit, he adds:Profit Amount = Cost Price * 20%Finally, the selling price with the discount and profit factored in:Selling Price = (Marked Price - Discount Amount) + Profit AmountFor the given sewing machine with a cost price of Rs. 1200/-, let's denote the marked price as MP and perform the calculations.1. To find the marked price before the discount:MP = Cost Price / (1 - Discount Rate)MP = 1200 / (1 - 0.20)2. To achieve a 20% profit:Profit Amount = 1200 * 0.203. To find the required markup for a 20% profit after the discount:Markup Percentage = (Profit Amount + Discount Amount) / MP * 1004. The 20% discount affects the selling price by reducing it, while the 20% profit ensures a higher return for the seller.5. The final formula for the selling price:Selling Price = MP * (1 - 0.20) + (1200 * 0.20)Given the discount rate and cost price, we can now find the marked price that would result in a 20% profit after a 20% discount on the Rs. 1200/- sewing machine.Let's calculate these values step by step.

Question:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:pen company, quality of writing pens, 10% defective, 7200 pens, Rs. 10 each, 25% profit, manufactured cost.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many pens were manufactured originally?2. What is the total revenue generated from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each?3. What is the total profit made by the company?4. What is the total cost of manufacturing 7200 non-defective pens?5. What is the manufactured cost of each pen?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:From the question, we know that 10% of the pens are defective and will be rejected. Therefore, the number of non-defective pens that the company delivers to the wholesaler is 90% of the total number of pens produced. We can calculate this value as follows:
Number of Non-Defective Pens = Total Number of Pens * 90%Given that the company promised to deliver 7200 pens, we can equate the two expressions and solve for the total number of pens produced.
Total Number of Pens = 7200 / 0.90
Next, we can calculate the total revenue generated from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each.
Total Revenue = 7200 * Rs. 10
We also know that the company made a 25% profit overall. To find the total cost, we can use the following formula:
Total Cost = Total Revenue / (1 + Profit Percentage)
Finally, to find the manufactured cost of each pen, we divide the total cost by the number of non-defective pens.
Manufactured Cost per Pen = Total Cost / Number of Non-Defective Pens

In conclusion, we can find the manufactured cost of each pen by following these steps.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
 Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, rows, rate, 4 kmph, still water, rate against the current, 2 kmph, rate along the current.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the man's speed in still water if he rows at 4 kmph?2. What is the formula to calculate the speed of an object moving against the current, given the man's rowing speed and his speed against the current?3. Who is the subject of the problem, and what is their action that affects the calculation of the rate along the current?4. In what situation does the man's rate against the current play a role in determining his rate along the current?5. When would you need to consider both the man's speed in still water and his speed against the current to find the rate along the current?6. How can you combine the given rates (4 kmph and 2 kmph) to determine the man's speed along the current?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The problem revolves around a man who is rowing a boat. To find his speed in still water, we can use the basic formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. However, since the question doesn't provide specific distances, we'll assume that his rowing speed of 4 kmph represents his constant speed in calm waters without any external factors.To calculate the man's speed when rowing against the current, we need to consider the combined effect of his rowing effort and the river's flow. The formula for this is:Speed against the current = Rowing speed - Speed of the currentHowever, the speed of the current is not given in the problem. Let's denote it as 'C' kmph. If the man rows at 4 kmph and his speed against the current is 2 kmph, we can deduce that:2 kmph = 4 kmph - CSolving for C, we get:C = 4 kmph - 2 kmphC = 2 kmphNow, to find the man's speed along the current, we use the same formula but with the speed of the current added to his rowing speed:Speed along the current = Rowing speed + Speed of the currentSpeed along the current = 4 kmph + 2 kmphSpeed along the current = 6 kmphIn this case, the man's rate against the current (2 kmph) plays a role when determining his rate along the current because it accounts for the resistance caused by the flow of the water. When the man's speed in still water (4 kmph) and his speed against the current are both known, as they are here, you can directly combine them to find the rate along the current without needing additional context or conditions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:average weight, 10 oarsmen, boat, increased by 1.8 kg, one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg, replaced, new man, weight.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the difference in average weight before and after the replacement?2. What is the formula to calculate the total weight of all oarsmen before and after the replacement?3. Who is the subject being replaced (the old oarsman), and what is his weight (53 kg)?4. What is the significance of the increase in average weight (1.8 kg) when finding the weight of the new man?5. When does the average weight increase, and why is the new man responsible for this change?6. How can you use the given information to find the weight of the new man, accounting for the change in average weight and the old oarsman's weight?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When one person is replaced by another in a group, and the average weight changes, it implies that there is a net difference in weight between the two individuals. Here, the average weight of the 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when the old oarsman weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new man. We can find the weight of the new man by considering the following steps:

Step 1: Calculate the difference in average weight.
Difference = 1.8 kg

Step 2: Multiply the difference in average weight by the number of people in the group.
Total Weight Difference = Difference in Average Weight * Number of People
Total Weight Difference = 1.8 kg * 10 people = 18 kg

Step 3: Subtract the old oarsman's weight from the total weight difference to find the weight of the new man.
Weight of New Man = Total Weight Difference - Old Oarsman's Weight
Weight of New Man = 18 kg - 53 kg = -35 kg

The result obtained is negative, indicating that our calculations are incorrect. There seems to be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices provided. Please verify the question and answer choices again.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is none of them.

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:winter vacation, summer vacation, employees, 75 percent, 40 percent, 20 percent, Q percent, take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What do we need to know in order to solve the problem?2. How do we calculate the total percentage of employees taking vacations?3. What is the relationship between the percentages given and the employees taking only a summer vacation?4. Can we use the given percentages to infer anything about the remaining employees?5. Are there any other details in the question that may help us solve the problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To solve the problem, we first need to know the total number of employees at the company. This will allow us to calculate the absolute numbers for each category of employees. Next, we must consider the following categories:Winter Vacation OnlySummer Vacation OnlyBoth Winter and Summer VacationsNo Vacation at AllWe know that 75% of employees take a winter vacation, and 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation. Therefore, 35% of employees take either a winter vacation only or no vacation at all. We also know that 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. So, 15% of employees take a winter vacation only (35% - 20%). Now, we want to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Let's call this value x%. Since all employees fall into one of the four categories mentioned above, we can express the relationships between these categories using addition and subtraction. According to the given data, we have the following equation:Winter Vacation Only + Summer Vacation Only + Both Winter and Summer Vacations + No Vacation at All = 100%Substituting the known values, we get:15% + x% + 40% + 20% = 100%Simplifying the equation, we obtain:75% + x% = 100%Hence, x% = 100% - 75%x% = 25%

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Question:Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
 Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Anna, 5 more articles, $300, price of each article, decreased by 15%, new selling price of each article..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the decrease in price of each article?2. How much was the original price of each article before the decrease?3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original price?4. How much did Anna spend on the initial articles before the price drop?5. In terms of the original price, what is the factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease?6. What is the total cost of the 5 additional articles Anna bought at the new price?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Anna observed a decrease in the price of each article during her shopping trip. To represent this decrease mathematically, we can use subtraction, specifically the division of the original price by the original price minus the percentage decrease. The percentage decrease is given as 15%. Let's denote the original price per article as \( P \) and the decrease as \( D \). The decrease in price per article can be calculated using the formula:\[ D = P \times \frac{15}{100} \]This represents a 15% decrease in the price.To find out how much the original price was, we need to divide the decreased price by \( (1 - \frac{15}{100}) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{85}{100} \) or 0.85:\[ P = \frac{D}{\frac{15}{100}} = \frac{D}{0.15} \]Unfortunately, we don't have the exact value for \( D \) but we can express it in terms of \( P \):\[ P = \frac{P \times 0.15}{0.15} \]\[ P = P \]So, the original price remains the same since the decrease is a percentage of the original price.Now, let's say that Anna initially bought \( n \) articles at the original price \( P \). The total amount she spent before the price drop would be:\[ \text{Initial cost} = n \times P \]After the 15% decrease, the new price per article is \( P - D \). If Anna then bought an additional 5 articles at this new price, the total cost for those articles would be:\[ \text{Additional cost} = 5 \times (P - D) \]To find the total factor by which the price was reduced due to the 15% decrease, we can express it as \( 1 - \frac{D}{P} \):\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - \frac{P \times 0.15}{P} \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 1 - 0.15 \]\[ \text{Price reduction factor} = 0.85 \]In summary, the decrease in price per article is represented by \( P \times \frac{15}{100} \), the original price remains unchanged, the 15% decrease is applied as a factor of 0.85 to the original price, and the total cost for the additional 5 articles at the new price is \( 5 \times (P - D) \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, discount of 20%, items, original price, percentage increase, required.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the relationship between the discounted price and the original price? 2. What is the formula for calculating the percentage increase? 3. How do you use the formula to find the required percentage increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:When a shopkeeper applies a 20% discount to the original price, the resulting price will be 80% of the original price. We can express this relationship as follows:Discounted Price = Original Price \* (1 - Discount Rate)Where the Discount Rate is expressed as a decimal. In this case, the Discount Rate is 20%, so it becomes 0.20. Plugging in the values, we get:Discounted Price = Original Price \* (1 - 0.20)Discounted Price = Original Price \* 0.80Now, the shopkeeper wants to return to the original price on another day. To find the required percentage increase, we can use the following formula:Percentage Increase = \[(New Price - Old Price) / Old Price\] \* 100%Where the New Price is the desired final price (the original price) and the Old Price is the current price (the discounted price). Substituting the values, we get:Percentage Increase = \[(Original Price - Discounted Price) / Discounted Price\] \* 100%Percentage Increase = \[(Original Price - Original Price \* 0.80) / (Original Price \* 0.80)\] \* 100%Simplifying the expression, we obtain:Percentage Increase = \[(0.20 \* Original Price) / (0.80 \* Original Price)\] \* 100%Percentage Increase = \[0.25 \* 100%\]Percentage Increase = 25%

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:mixture, 10kg, 30% sand, 70% clay, equal quantities of clay and sand, remove, replace with pure sand.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much of the mixture is sand currently?2. How much of the mixture is clay currently?3. How much sand do we need to have equal quantities of both?4. How much of the mixture do we need to remove to balance the sand and clay equally?5. What fraction of the original mixture does this represent?6. Can we simplify the fraction to a simpler form?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To solve this problem, we first need to understand the current composition of the mixture. We know that the mixture consists of 30% sand and 70% clay. This means that for every 100 units of the mixture, there are 30 units of sand and 70 units of clay.

First, we need to determine how much of the mixture is sand currently. Since there are 10 kg of the mixture and 30% of it is sand, we can calculate the weight of the sand as follows:
\( Sand = 10 \text{ kg} \times 0.30 = 3 \text{ kg} \)

Next, we need to determine how much of the mixture is clay currently. Using the same method, we can calculate the weight of the clay as follows:
\( Clay = 10 \text{ kg} \times 0.70 = 7 \text{ kg} \)

Now, to have equal quantities of both sand and clay, we need to subtract some quantity of the mixture and replace it with an equivalent amount of pure sand. Since we want to end up with 7 kg of sand, we need to remove 3 kg of the mixture containing clay and replace it with 3 kg of pure sand.

To find the fraction of the original mixture that needs to be removed, we can divide the weight of the mixture that needs to be removed by the total weight of the original mixture:
\( Fraction\ Removed = \frac{\text{Weight of Mixture Removed}}{\text{Total Weight of Original Mixture}} \)
\( Fraction\ Removed = \frac{3 \text{ kg}}{10 \text{ kg}} \)

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 in this case:
\( Fraction\ Removed = \frac{3}{10} \)

We can express this fraction as a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator:
\( Fraction\ Removed = 0.3 \)

Alternatively, we can express this fraction as a mixed number by dividing the numerator by the denominator and expressing any remainder as a proper fraction:
\( Fraction\ Removed = 0 \text{ and } \frac{3}{10} \)
\( Fraction\ Removed = 0 \frac{3}{10} \)

However, since the options only include fractions, we'll stick with the simplified fraction representation.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:organization, raise Rs. 6 lakh, equal contribution, each employee, Rs. 60 extra, Rs. 6.24 lakh, contribution.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the difference in the amount raised between the original plan and the revised plan?2. How many employees are there in the organization?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To find the difference in the amount raised, we can subtract the original amount from the revised amount: \( 6.24 \text{ lakhs} - 6 \text{ lakhs} = 0.24 \text{ lakhs} \).
Now, we need to find the number of employees in the organization. We know that each employee contributed an extra Rs. 60 towards the revised amount, so we can equate this to the difference found earlier:
\( 0.24 \text{ lakhs} = 60 \times \text{number of employees} \)
Converting lakh to rupees, we get:
\( 24,000 = 60 \times \text{number of employees} \)
Dividing both sides by 60, we obtain the number of employees:
\( \text{number of employees} = \frac{24,000}{60} = 400 \)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Input:
Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Home Appliance Store, average, microwave ovens, per month, last year, 42, first 10 months, this year, 20, arithmetic mean, entire 22 months period..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the average calculation require to find out the monthly sales of microwaves last year?2. What is the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year according to the average provided?3. Who or what entity is being measured in terms of microwave oven sales in this problem?4. In which timeframe are the sales from the first 10 months of this year being considered?5. When did the change in sales pattern occur, from last year to this year?6. How can we calculate the average sales of microwaves for the entire 22-month period to answer the original question?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the monthly sales of microwaves for the last year, one would need to perform an average calculation. This requires summing up the sales figures for each month and dividing that total by the number of months in the year, typically 12. According to the provided average, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last year amounts to the average multiplied by the number of months, which can be calculated as:Total sales (last year) = Average sales per month * 12The entity being measured in terms of microwave oven sales in this problem is the quantity or units sold, which could represent individual appliances. The first 10 months of this year's sales are considered within the timeframe from January to October.A change in sales pattern occurred when comparing the sales from the last year to the current year, potentially indicating a shift starting from November or December of the previous year, marking the beginning of the new trend.To calculate the average sales of microwaves for the entire 22-month period (assuming the first 12 months are from the previous year and the next 10 from the current year), you would again take the sum of sales for both sets of months and divide by 22:Average sales (22 months) = (Sum of sales from last year + Sum of sales from current year's first 10 months) / 22By following these steps and using the given data, we can arrive at accurate answers for the annual and extended period sales averages. However, without specific numbers for the average sales per month or the total sales, the calculations cannot be performed here.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
 Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:exam, class, average (arithmetic mean), highest score, lowest score, x, average score for the entire class, y, number of students, z, excluding, highest and lowest scorers..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the average of the highest and lowest scores in the problem?2. What is the formula to calculate the average of the entire class, given the sum and the number of students?3. Who are the two scores being excluded when calculating the average for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?4. In what context does the problem occur - a single exam or multiple exams?5. When does the exclusion of the highest and lowest scores take place - before or after determining the overall class average?6. Why is it necessary to exclude the highest and lowest scores when finding the new average?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the problem at hand, the process of finding the average involves several steps. To determine the average of the highest and lowest scores, one would typically use the arithmetic mean operation. This method requires adding the two scores together and then dividing by the count of scores, which is 2 in this case.To calculate the overall class average, given the sum of all scores (let's denote it as S) and the number of students (N), the formula is:Average_class = S / NWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores from the class average, we are looking at a different scenario. Let's assume the sum of scores excluding the top and bottom scores is denoted as S' and there are (N-2) students left. The new average, known as the median average, can be calculated using the following formula:New_average = S' / (N - 2)This exclusion occurs in the context of multiple exams or assignments, where outliers like exceptional performances or extreme difficulties might skew the overall grade distribution. By removing these scores, the new average provides a more representative measure of the typical performance for the majority of students.The exclusion of the highest and lowest scores takes place after determining the initial overall class average, but before computing the median average. The rationale behind this exclusion is to mitigate the influence of any extreme values that might not accurately reflect the typical student performance. This ensures a more balanced and fair assessment of the students' abilities.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:average (arithmetic mean), weight, 10 vehicles, 12.2 tons, increased by 2.6 tons, new heavy duty truck, group of vehicles, what is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of 'average (arithmetic mean)' in the context of this problem?2. How many vehicles were part of the original group?3. What was the average weight of the original group of vehicles?4. How much did the average weight increase after the addition of the heavy duty truck?5. Can we calculate the total weight of the original group of vehicles?6. Can we calculate the total weight of the updated group of vehicles, including the heavy duty truck?7. If so, how do we determine the weight of the heavy duty truck?8. Based on the given answer choices, which value corresponds to the weight of the heavy duty truck?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:1. The average (arithmetic mean) refers to the sum of all the weights divided by the total number of vehicles.2. There were originally 10 vehicles in the group.3. The average weight of the original group of vehicles was 12.2 tons.4. After the addition of the heavy duty truck, the average weight increased by 2.6 tons.5. Yes, we can calculate the total weight of the original group of vehicles by multiplying the average weight by the number of vehicles.6. Yes, we can calculate the total weight of the updated group by using the new average weight and the number of vehicles, including the heavy duty truck.7. To determine the weight of the heavy duty truck, subtract the total weight of the original group from the total weight of the updated group.8. Compare the result obtained in step 7 with the given answer choices to identify the correct option.

Given:
Original group of vehicles: 10
Average weight of original group: 12.2 tons
Increase in average weight: 2.6 tons

First, calculate the total weight of the original group:
Total_weight_original = Average_weight_original * Number_of_vehicles
Total_weight_original = 12.2 tons * 10
Total_weight_original = 122 tons

Next, calculate the total weight of the updated group, including the heavy duty truck:
Average_weight_updated = Average_weight_original + Increase_in_average_weight
Average_weight_updated = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons
Average_weight_updated = 14.8 tons

Number_of_vehicles_in_updated_group = Number_of_vehicles + 1
Number_of_vehicles_in_updated_group = 10 + 1
Number_of_vehicles_in_updated_group = 11

Total_weight_updated = Average_weight_updated * Number_of_vehicles_in_updated_group
Total_weight_updated = 14.8 tons * 11
Total_weight_updated = 162.8 tons

Finally, calculate the weight of the heavy duty truck:
Weight_of_heavy_duty_truck = Total_weight_updated - Total_weight_original
Weight_of_heavy_duty_truck = 162.8 tons - 122 tons
Weight_of_heavy_duty_truck = 40.8 tons

From the given answer choices, the closest match is Option A: 40.8 tons.

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Input:
Question:A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:coin, alloy of aluminum and silver, 2 x 15 mm, thickness 2 mm, diameter 15 mm, weight 30 grams, volume of aluminum, volume of silver, pure aluminum, 1 x 30 mm, weight of a coin.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin, considering it's 2 mm thick?2. What is the ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver, given they are equal in the alloy coin?3. How much does 1 gram of pure silver weigh compared to 1 gram of pure aluminum, based on the given information?4. In the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, what is the total volume?5. Using the ratio of silver to aluminum weights, how much would a 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin weigh if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?6. From the answer choices, which option represents the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length × width × height. So, the volume (V) would be:V = 2 mm * 15 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.Given that the alloy coin has an equal volume of aluminum and silver, let's denote the volume of each metal as V_A (aluminum) and V_S (silver). Since they're equal, we have:V_A = V_SThe ratio of the volume of aluminum to the volume of silver is therefore:Ratio = V_A / V_S = 1 (since they're equal)Now, let's address the weight difference between 1 gram of pure silver and 1 gram of pure aluminum. The passage doesn't provide specific densities for aluminum and silver, but assuming you know their densities (ρ_A for aluminum and ρ_S for silver), the weight (W) can be calculated using the formula:W = mass × densityFor 1 gram of each metal:W_S (silver) = 1 g * ρ_SW_A (aluminum) = 1 g * ρ_AThe weight ratio would be:Weight_Ratio = W_S / W_A = ρ_S / ρ_AIn the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, the volume is simply:V_Aluminum = 1 mm * 30 mm * 2 mm = 60 cubic millimeters.If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and we have the weight of the aluminum coin (W_A), the weight of the equivalent silver coin (W_S) would be:W_S = 2 * W_AFinally, to find the correct weight of the 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin, we need to know the actual density of aluminum, but without it, we can only express the weight in terms of its density:Weight_Aluminum = 1 g/cm³ * (60 cm³) = 60 grams (assuming the density of aluminum is 1 g/cm³).With this information, the passage can be constructed:---To find the volume of the 2 x 15 mm coin with a thickness of 2 mm, we apply the formula V = length × width × height, resulting in a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. Since the alloy coin contains equal volumes of aluminum and silver, their ratio is 1:1.When comparing the weight of 1 gram of pure silver to 1 gram of pure aluminum, their weights depend on their respective densities. Without specific densities, we cannot provide exact weights but can express the ratio as ρ_S / ρ_A.The 1 x 30 mm pure aluminum coin has a volume of 60 cubic millimeters. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of an equivalent aluminum coin would be 60 grams (assuming a density of 1 g/cm³ for aluminum).Without knowing the densities, we cannot determine the exact weight of the aluminum coin, but the correct answer choice from the options would reflect its weight based on the given density assumption.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
 Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:x men, x hours per day, x units of work, y men, y hours per day, y days.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the relationship between the work done by x men and y men?2. What is the formula to calculate the work done by x men in x days, considering they work x hours per day?3. How should we adjust the rate of work when comparing x men's work to y men's work?4. In the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, how should we modify the initial rate of work to find out the total work completed in y days?5. Where does the concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersect in the problem to determine the efficiency of work completion?6. Why is it necessary to convert the initial conditions (x men, x hours/day, x units) to a comparable form before calculating y men's work in y days and y hours/day?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The relationship between the work done by x men and y men can be represented mathematically using the concept of combined effort or the concept of man-hours. The work done by x men in one hour is multiplied by the number of hours worked by each man, and then multiplied by the number of men to get the total work output per day. This can be expressed as:1. Work done by x men (W_x) in one hour = x * x (since each man works at the same rate)2. Total work done by x men in x days with x hours/day = W_x * x * x daysTo compare the work of x men to y men, we need to adjust the rate of work. If y men are working with the same efficiency, we can equate their hourly work rates:3. Work done by y men (W_y) in one hour = x * x / yIn the new scenario with y men and y hours per day, we first need to modify the initial rate of work to account for the different number of men and hours. We can do this by calculating the work done by one man in one hour and then multiplying by y men and y hours:4. Modified rate of work (R') = (x * x) / (y^2)Now, to find the total work completed in y days with y hours/day, we multiply the modified rate by the number of men, days, and hours:5. Total work done by y men in y days with y hours/day = R' * y * yThe concept of "men" and "hours per day" intersects in the problem when determining productivity, as it reflects the efficiency of labor and the time allocated for work. To accurately compare the efficiency and determine the total work output, it is crucial to convert the initial conditions to a comparable form, ensuring that the same number of hours per day is used in both scenarios.In summary, the passage explains that the relationship between x and y men's work can be calculated using man-hour rates, adjusting for different numbers of men and hours, and then applying the modified rate to find the total work completed in the new scenario. Converting to a comparable form ensures accurate comparisons of efficiency.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:two alloys X and Y, ratio of zinc and copper, 6:9, 7:11, 40 grams of alloy X, 60 grams of alloy Y, mixed to form alloy Z, ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X?2. What is the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y?3. How to combine the zinc and copper from both alloys X and Y?4. What is the final ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:1. To find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X, we need to use the given ratio of 6:9. First, divide the total number of parts (6+9=15) by the sum of the weights of the alloys (40 grams): 15/40. Then, multiply the result by the individual ratios for zinc and copper: 6*15/40 for zinc and 9*15/40 for copper.锌在合金X中的重量为：6 * 15/40 = 2.25克铜在合金X中的重量为：9 * 15/40 = 3.375克2. Similarly, to find the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y, we can use the given ratio of 7:11. Again, divide the total number of parts (7+11=18) by the sum of the weights of the alloys (60 grams): 18/60. Then, multiply the result by the individual ratios for zinc and copper: 7*18/60 for zinc and 11*18/60 for copper.锌在合金Y中的重量为：7 * 18/60 = 2.1克铜在合金Y中的重量为：11 * 18/60 = 3.3克3. To combine the zinc and copper from both alloys X and Y, we add up the individual amounts of zinc and copper: 锌的总重量 = 2.25克（合金X）+ 2.1克（合金Y）= 4.35克铜的总重量 = 3.375克（合金X）+ 3.3克（合金Y）= 6.675克4. Finally, to find the final ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we can divide the total amount of zinc by the total amount of copper: （锌的总重量）/（铜的总重量）= 4.35克/6.675克= 0.65。Since the ratio must be simplified to a whole number, we can multiply both sides by 20 to obtain the final answer: 13/20。

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift? Answer Choices: (A) D/ (M-3)  (B) MD/3 (C) M/ (D-3)  (D) 3D/ (M2-3M)  (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:m, D, 3 men drop out, much more, each have to contribute, purchase of the gift.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much does each person originally contribute towards the gift?2. How much does each person contribute towards the gift after 3 men drop out?3. How much more do the remaining people need to contribute individually to cover the original cost?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:
Passage: Initially, there are m men who agreed to purchase a gift worth Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, the remaining men must now split the cost equally among themselves. We want to find how much more each person needs to contribute to cover the original price of the gift.

1. Each person's original contribution can be calculated as: Original contribution per person = D/m
2. After 3 men drop out, the remaining men are m - 3. Their combined contribution will still be equal to the original cost of the gift, D. So, the new contribution per person can be calculated as: New contribution per person = D/(m - 3)
3. To find how much more each person needs to contribute, subtract the original contribution from the new one: Additional contribution per person = New contribution per person - Original contribution per person Additional contribution per person = [D/(m - 3)] - [D/m]

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Conclusion: The additional contribution each person needs to pay towards the gift after 3 men drop out can be expressed as 3D/(m^2 - 3m).

 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Sam's hard drive, 250 files, infected, virus, worm, infected only by worm, both virus and worm, 50% not infected by virus, files NOT infected by worm.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation connects the number of files infected only by a worm to those infected by both virus and worm?2. What is the relationship between the number of files infected by both virus and worm, expressed as a factor?3. Who is the subject of the problem regarding the infection status of files?4. Where does the issue with the files take place?5. When is this problem set in terms of the infection status of the files?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of files not infected by a virus in order to find out the number not infected by a worm?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a cybersecurity scenario, the infection status of files was analyzed to understand the spread of malware. The first step in the investigation involved determining the relationship between different types of infections. When examining the data, it was found that the operation "union" connected the number of files infected solely by a worm (W) to those infected by both a virus (V) and a worm (W), denoted as V ∪ W. This union represents the total count of files affected by either a virus or a worm.To express the relationship as a factor, we can calculate the overlap, which is the intersection of the virus and worm infections (V ∩ W). If we let X be the total number of files under consideration, the factor representing the files infected by both can be calculated using the formula:Factor = (|V ∩ W|) / XThe subject of the problem revolves around the computer system, where files are stored and potentially vulnerable to infection. The issue with these files took place on a networked environment, where they could easily spread through shared resources.This problem is set at a specific point in time, when the IT team collected data on the infection status of the files to assess the extent of the threat. To find out the percentage of files not infected by a worm, it's crucial to know the proportion of files not infected by a virus (100% - (Percentage of V-infected files)). Since worms can infect files that were not already infected by a virus, knowing this percentage helps to deduce the remaining portion of files that would have remained unaffected by the worm if no virus had been present. This information is vital for prioritizing security measures and understanding the potential impact of the worm alone.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:forest, 300 deer tagged, 2001, 500 deer caught, 20 deer tagged, 2002, percent of deer with tags, representative, total deer population, no change in population between 2001 and 2002.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the connection between the number of tagged deer caught in 2002 and the total deer population in the forest?2. How do the 20 tagged deer caught in 2002 relate to the 500 deer caught in 2002?3. Can we use the percentage of tagged deer caught in 2002 to estimate the total number of tagged deer in the forest?4. How does the assumption of no change in population between 2001 and 2002 affect our calculations?5. Given the ratio of tagged deer to total deer caught in 2002, how can we calculate the total deer population in the forest?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a large forest, researchers conducted two separate studies involving tagging and catching deer. The first study occurred in 2001, where 300 deer were caught, tagged, and released back into the forest. The second study took place in 2002, where 500 deer were randomly captured, and 20 of them had tags from the previous year's study. The researchers assumed that the percentage of tagged deer caught in 2002 was representative of the overall percentage of tagged deer in the entire forest.

We can establish a connection between the number of tagged deer caught in 2002 and the total deer population in the forest by finding the percentage of tagged deer among the 500 deer caught in 2002. In this case, 20 tagged deer out of 500 deer gives us a percentage of 4%.

Using this percentage, we can estimate the total number of tagged deer in the forest by multiplying the total deer population by 4%. To find the total deer population, we need to account for the assumption of no change in population between 2001 and 2002.

Since there was no change in the deer population between 2001 and 2002, we can conclude that the total number of tagged deer in the forest remains the same as the initial 300 tagged deer. Now, we can calculate the total deer population by dividing the number of tagged deer by their percentage representation:

Total Deer Population = Number of Tagged Deer / Tagged Deer Percentage
Total Deer Population = 300 / 0.04
Total Deer Population = 7500

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 60 (C) 28 (D) 26 (E) 18
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Mark, John, money, Mark gets half of John's money, Mark has Rs.75, John gets one-third of Mark's money, John has Rs.75.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75" statement?2. What is the meaning of "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-." statement?3. What mathematical operations should be performed to find the amount of money John initially had?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:From the first statement, we understand that if John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs.75. This means that Mark currently has Rs.75 - half of John's money. From the second statement, we learn that if John gets one-third of Mark's money, he will have Rs.75. This means that John currently has Rs.75 - one-third of Mark's money. To find the initial amount of money John had, we can set up two equations and solve for the unknowns. Let's denote John's initial amount as J and Mark's initial amount as M. The first equation will be: \( M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \) The second equation will be: \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \) By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of J and M.

Unfortunately, the given answer choices do not contain the result of our calculations, so we cannot provide the correct answer. However, the approach outlined above should lead to the solution if additional calculations are performed.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is none of the above.

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Daifu university, students, chess club, swim team, 24%, members, 20%, swim team members, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club?2. What calculation can be performed to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club?3. Who are the members being referred to in the problem (students, faculty, or staff) that are part of the chess club and swim team?4. Where does the 24% figure come from and how does it relate to the total student population?5. When is this information about chess club and swim team memberships relevant? Is it for a particular academic year or a general statistic?6. Why is it important to know the percentage of swim team members who are not in the chess club? Could it be related to resource allocation or club overlap?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a school setting, the interest lies in understanding the participation patterns of students in extracurricular activities. To find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club, one would use the subtraction operation. First, let's assume that 40% of the students are on the swim team and 32% are in the chess club. Since some students might be in both clubs, if we denote the intersection as X, we can calculate the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as follows:Percentage of Swim Team \- Percentage of Both Clubs = (40% - (40% + 32% - 100% of Both)) = (40% - (72% - 100%))Percentage of Swim Team Only = 40% - 28%For the second calculation, to determine the number of swim team members who are also in the chess club, we need to find the overlap. We can use the formula:Number of Both = Total Swim Team Members \* (Chess Club Percentage / 100)Let's say there are 1000 students in total, which gives us 400 students on the swim team. Using the chess club's 32%:Number of Both = 400 \* (32/100) = 128 studentsThe members being referred to here are students, specifically those who participate in the chess club and the swim team. The 24% figure mentioned could represent the combined membership of both clubs as a proportion of the total student population. If 24% corresponds to the sum of the swim team and chess club members minus the overlap, we can deduce that:Total Students = (24% of 1000) = 240 studentsThis information is relevant for the current academic year, providing insights into the distribution of students among these clubs. Knowing the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club is crucial for resource allocation, as it helps administrators understand the unique interests of each group and plan accordingly. For instance, if there are limited pool hours or equipment, knowing this ratio ensures that resources are fairly distributed between the two clubs to avoid overlap or underutilization.

Question:In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:chocolate store, chocolates, vanilla flavored, cocoa flavored, squashed, percentage.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates in the store?2. What is the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates in the store?3. What is the percentage of squashed chocolates in the store?4. How do I find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
We can find the answer by following these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates:Given that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, we subtract this value from 100% to get the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:100% - 10% = 90%

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of squashed chocolates:We are given that 90% of the rest (vanilla flavored) are squashed. However, since we already know that vanilla flavored chocolates account for 90% of the total, we can directly equate them:Vanilla flavored chocolates = 90% of total chocolates

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed:Since all vanilla flavored chocolates are either squashed or not squashed, we can subtract the percentage of squashed vanilla flavored chocolates from the total percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates to find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed.

Now, we know that 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed, so we can express this as:90% of Vanilla flavored chocolates = Squashed Vanilla flavored chocolates

To find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed, we subtract the percentage of squashed vanilla flavored chocolates from the total percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:

Not Squashed Vanilla flavored chocolates = Vanilla flavored chocolates - Squashed Vanilla flavored chocolatesNot Squashed Vanilla flavored chocolates = 90% - 90%Not Squashed Vanilla flavored chocolates = 0%

However, this result contradicts our expectations because we expect there to be some vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed. There seems to be an error in the provided data or the question itself.

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
 Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:percentage gain, merchant, purchased, 90 kg, oranges, Rs. 450, sold, rate, Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges?2. What is the total cost price of the 90 kg oranges that the merchant purchased?3. How much did the merchant sell each kilogram of oranges for?4. How much revenue did the merchant generate from selling all the oranges?5. In what context does the percentage gain calculation take place (purchasing vs. selling)?6. Which formula can be applied to find the percentage gain in this scenario?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the merchant's gain on the oranges, we need to determine the percentage increase in the value of the goods after selling them. The merchant initially purchased 90 kilograms of oranges at a certain cost price per kilogram. Unfortunately, the cost price per kilogram is not provided, so let's denote it as \( C \) (in rupees per kg). The total cost price (\( T_{CP} \)) can be calculated using the formula:\[ T_{CP} = 90 \text{ kg} \times C \]The merchant sold the oranges for a selling price of 117 rupees per kilogram, which we'll denote as \( S \). The total revenue (\( T_R \)) from selling the oranges is thus:\[ T_R = 90 \text{ kg} \times 117 \text{ rupees/kg} \]To find the gain, we first need to determine the profit (\( P \)), which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost price:\[ P = T_R - T_{CP} \]The percentage gain (\( G \)) can then be calculated using the formula:\[ G = \left( \frac{P}{T_{CP}} \right) \times 100\% \]If we know the cost price per kilogram, we can substitute it into the equations to find the gain. However, without the specific cost price, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer for the gain percentage. Nonetheless, the calculations above outline the process to determine the merchant's gain in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, spend, 810, buying trousers, Rs 70 each, shirts, Rs 30 each, maximum number of trousers, ratio of trousers and shirts.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the maximum number of trousers that can be bought with the given budget?2. How many shirts can be bought with the remaining money after purchasing the maximum number of trousers?3. What is the ratio of trousers to shirts based on the quantities purchased?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the maximum number of trousers that can be bought, we need to divide the total spending budget by the cost of one trouser:\[ \text{Number of trousers} = \frac{\text{Spending Budget}}{\text{Cost per Trouser}} \]
For our case, this would be:
\[ \text{Number of trousers} = \frac{810}{70} \approx 11.57 \]

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a trouser, we must round down to the nearest integer, resulting in 11 trousers.

Next, we need to determine how many shirts can be bought with the remaining money. First, subtract the total cost of the trousers from the spending budget to find the remaining amount:\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Spending Budget} - \text{Total Cost of Trousers} \]
Then, divide the remaining money by the cost of one shirt to find the number of shirts:\[ \text{Number of Shirts} = \frac{\text{Remaining Money}}{\text{Cost per Shirt}} \]
For our case, this would be:
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = 810 - (11 \times 70) = 810 - 770 = 40 \]\[ \text{Number of Shirts} = \frac{40}{30} = 1.33 \]

Again, since we can't buy a fraction of a shirt, we must round down to the nearest integer, resulting in 1 shirt.

Finally, we can now calculate the ratio of trousers to shirts based on the quantities purchased:
\[ \text{Ratio of Trousers to Shirts} = \frac{\text{Number of Trousers}}{\text{Number of Shirts}} \]
For our case, this would be:
\[ \text{Ratio of Trousers to Shirts} = \frac{11}{1} = 11:1 \]

So, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11, and the ratio of trousers to shirts is 11:1.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?
 Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:original price, item, discounted price, $20-off coupon, no tax, customer paid, $1.90 more, half the original price..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%?2. What calculation is needed to determine the final price after applying the $20-off coupon to the discounted price?3. Who is responsible for paying the $20-off coupon and how does it affect the final price?4. In what situation does the customer pay $1.90 more than what? 5. When calculating the customer's payment, which part of the original price is being compared - the full price or half the price?6. How much does the customer pay in total, and how does this relate to half the original price plus $1.90?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the discounted price when the original price is discounted by 22%, you would apply the formula for calculating a percentage decrease: (discount rate / 100) * original price. For example, if the original price is $100, the discounted price would be $100 * (1 - 0.22) = $78.Next, if there's a $20-off coupon applied to the discounted price, you subtract the value of the coupon from the discounted price. So if the discounted price is still $78, the final price after applying the coupon would be $78 - $20 = $58.The person responsible for paying the $20-off coupon is typically the customer, as they receive the discount. This directly affects the final price by reducing it by the amount of the coupon.In this situation, the customer pays $1.90 more than the discounted price without the coupon ($78). To understand why, we need to know that the coupon reduces the price by $20 but the customer ends up paying only $58, which is $1.90 less than $78.When calculating the customer's payment, it is the full price ($100) that is being compared, as the coupon is applied to the original price before any discounts are taken into account.Finally, to find out how much the customer pays in total, we add the additional $1.90 to the discounted price after the coupon is applied: $58 + $1.90 = $59.90. This total payment can be related to half the original price by noting that $59.90 is slightly more than half of $100 ($50), as it includes the extra $1.90 charge.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:invoice, motor boat, $20 000, terms, 4/30, n/100, highest simple interest rate, afford to borrow money, take advantage of the discount.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What do the terms "4/30, n/100" represent in the context of the invoice?2. How can the merchant calculate the maximum simple interest rate at which they can borrow money to take advantage of the discount?3. Why might the merchant want to take advantage of the discount?4. What factors could influence the merchant's decision to borrow money to pay off the invoice?5. How can the merchant ensure that their borrowing costs remain low while taking advantage of the discount?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:"4/30, n/100" represents a two-part discount offer. The first part is a 4% cash discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days. The second part is a net due date of 100 days from the invoice date, meaning the entire amount must be paid by then without any additional discounts.

The merchant can calculate the maximum simple interest rate at which they can borrow money to take advantage of the discount by considering the cost of borrowing against the savings from the discount. If the merchant borrows money at a higher interest rate than the discount offered, they would end up losing money overall. Therefore, the highest simple interest rate they can afford is equal to the discount rate offered, which in this case is 4%.

The merchant may want to take advantage of the discount because it allows them to save money on the invoice cost. By paying early, they can reduce the total amount owed, which can help improve their bottom line.

Several factors could influence the merchant's decision to borrow money to pay off the invoice, including their current cash flow, available credit, and potential impact on other business operations. It's essential for the merchant to carefully weigh the benefits and drawbacks of borrowing money before making a decision.

To ensure that their borrowing costs remain low while taking advantage of the discount, the merchant should shop around for the best interest rates and repayment terms. They should also consider their ability to repay the loan quickly, as this can minimize the overall cost of borrowing.

Given the analysis above, the correct answer is 4%, which corresponds to choice D: 215.67 (rounded to three decimal places).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Question:A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:shopkeeper, servant, monthly salary, 1500, commission, 15%, monthly income, 6000, Rupees..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the servant need to perform to calculate his total earnings from the commission?2. What percentage of the total sales would generate an additional 4500 Rupees for the servant to reach his desired monthly income?3. Who is responsible for providing the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant?4. In what currency are the monthly salary and commissions being discussed?5. When does the calculation of the commission take place - at the end of the month or continuously throughout?6. How much commission must the servant earn to add up to the difference between his target monthly income and the base salary, which is 4500 Rupees?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The servant needs to calculate his total earnings from the commission by performing a simple arithmetic operation. To determine the percentage that would generate an additional 4500 Rupees, he can use the formula: (additional amount / total sales) * 100%. His target monthly income consists of a base salary and a commission. The employer is responsible for providing both the monthly salary and commission payment to the servant. All financial transactions are in Rupees, the native currency of the country.To find out how much commission he needs to earn, the servant first subtracts his base salary of 20,000 Rupees from his desired monthly income of 24,500 Rupees, resulting in a difference of 4500 Rupees. This additional amount is the commission he aims to earn through sales. Since the calculation of the commission is typically done at the end of the month, the servant will know his total earnings after all sales have been accounted for. By using the previously mentioned formula, he can figure out the percentage of total sales required to reach this goal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many individuals in the family earn money?2. Is the median income always the middle value when arranging the incomes in ascending order?3. Can we assume that the family has an even number of members?4. How does the number of people earning money impact the median income?5. What is the definition of median income in this context?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To solve this problem, we'll start by considering the definition of median income. The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in ascending order. In other words, half of the family members earn less than the median income, and the other half earn more.

Given that the median income is $3000, we can conclude that there must be an odd number of family members because the median is always the middle value. Let's consider the possible scenarios for the number of family members and their corresponding incomes.

Case 1: 3 family members:
In this case, the median income would be the second-highest income. Since the median income is $3000, two family members must earn $3000, and one must earn either $3000 or less. But since everyone earns money, the third member must also earn at least $3000, making the sum of their incomes $9000 or greater, which fits the given condition.

Therefore, there are 3 family members.

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, city, 5265526, adults, 4169516, children..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the number of children in the city?2. What calculation can be done to find the difference between the total population and the number of adults to determine the number of children?3. Who is the group being subtracted from the city's population to find the number of children?4. In what context does the population figure of 5265526 apply to the problem?5. When would this question be relevant if it were part of a larger dataset or a changing scenario?6. Why is it important to know the number of children in the city if given the adult population?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the number of children in the city, one would first need to perform a subtraction operation on the total population figure. According to the provided information, the city has a population of 5,265,526. If we assume that the adults make up a certain percentage of this population, we can calculate the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population. The formula for this calculation would be:Number of Children = Total Population - Number of AdultsHowever, the exact calculation cannot be done without knowing the proportion of adults in the city. If we had that data, we could find the number of children as follows:Let A represent the number of adults, and C represent the number of children. Then, A + C = 5,265,526, and typically, we would need the percentage of adults (P_A) to express A as a fraction of the total population:A = P_A * 5,265,526Substituting A into the first equation:C = 5,265,526 - (P_A * 5,265,526)This calculation would be particularly relevant if the dataset included annual updates on population demographics or if the city's policies and services are heavily influenced by the age distribution, such as education, healthcare, or child-friendly facilities. Knowing the number of children is essential for planning and resource allocation, ensuring that the city's needs cater to its youngest residents and their development.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?
 Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:John, survey, car color, 60% women, men, 75% preferred red, 10 men, green cars, red cars, people took the survey..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the percentage of men who took the survey?2. What mathematical operation should be performed to calculate the total number of men surveyed?3. Who were the primary participants in the survey according to the given percentage?4. In what context was the survey conducted (John's study)?5. When did John conduct the survey, if it's relevant to the problem?6. How many men preferred green cars out of the total men surveyed, based on the given information?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In John's study, a survey was conducted to determine car preferences among a specific group of people. To find the percentage of men who took the survey, one would use the division operation, dividing the number of men by the total participants and then multiplying by 100. For instance, if 60% of the respondents were men, you would calculate it as (number of men / total participants) * 100.To calculate the total number of men surveyed, we need to know the percentage mentioned for men, which is 60% in this case. If we assume there were 800 participants in total, the calculation would be (60/100) * 800. After performing this calculation, we find that 480 men participated in the survey.The primary participants in the survey, according to the given percentage, were men, as 60% of them took part.The survey was conducted within the context of John's study, focusing on car preferences. However, the exact date is not provided in the information given.Out of the total men surveyed, 480 preferred green cars, as this is the number calculated from the 60% mentioned earlier.

Question:Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:population, increase, 10% per year, two years, projection, double, one year ago, percent population increase, last year.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Is there any mention of the current population in the passage?2. What does the "double" statement imply about the growth rate over the two-year period?3. How can we calculate the population increase in the last year based on the given information?4. What are the answer choices, and which one best fits the result obtained from the previous calculation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:There is no explicit mention of the current population in the passage. However, we can deduce that the projected growth over two years is 10% per year, meaning that after two years, the population will have grown by 20%. Since the population two years from now is said to be exactly double the population of one year ago, we can infer that the population must have grown by 100% over those two years. This implies that the population grew by approximately 50% in each of those two years. As the question asks for the population increase in the last year, our answer should be close to 50%.

Question:An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
 Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2)
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:exam, class, average (arithmetic mean), highest score, lowest score, x, average score for the entire class, y, number of students, z, excluding, highest and lowest scorers..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the average of the highest and lowest scores in the problem?2. What is the formula to calculate the average of the entire class, given the sum and the number of students?3. Who are the two scores being excluded when calculating the average for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?4. In what context does the problem occur - a single exam or multiple exams?5. When does the exclusion of the highest and lowest scores take place - before or after determining the overall class average?6. Why is it necessary to exclude the highest and lowest scores when finding the new average?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the problem at hand, the process of finding the average involves several steps. To determine the average of the highest and lowest scores, one would typically use the arithmetic mean operation. This method requires adding the two scores together and then dividing by the count of scores, which is 2 in this case.To calculate the overall class average, given the sum of all scores (let's denote it as S) and the number of students (N), the formula is:Average_class = S / NWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores from the class average, we are looking at a different scenario. Let's assume the sum of scores excluding the top and bottom scores is denoted as S' and there are (N-2) students left. The new average, known as the median average, can be calculated using the following formula:New_average = S' / (N - 2)This exclusion occurs in the context of multiple exams or assignments, where outliers like exceptional performances or extreme difficulties might skew the overall grade distribution. By removing these scores, the new average provides a more representative measure of the typical performance for the majority of students.The exclusion of the highest and lowest scores takes place after determining the initial overall class average, but before computing the median average. The rationale behind this exclusion is to mitigate the influence of any extreme values that might not accurately reflect the typical student performance. This ensures a more balanced and fair assessment of the students' abilities.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A sporting goods store, yellow and white golf balls, inventory, 600 golf balls, sold 80% of its inventory, equal number of yellow and white balls, white golf balls sold, yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find out how many golf balls were sold in total?2. What percentage of the inventory represents the number of yellow golf balls sold?3. Who are the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls?4. Where does the store start with yellow golf balls before the sales began?5. When did the store sell all its white golf balls?6. How many white golf balls were there initially if they were all sold?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:To determine the total number of golf balls sold, one would need to perform an addition operation, summing up the sales figures for each color. Let's say the store sold X yellow balls and Y white balls. The total would be X + Y.The percentage of the inventory representing yellow golf balls sold can be calculated using the formula: (Number of Yellow Balls Sold / Total Inventory) * 100%. If we assume the initial inventory had Z yellow balls, the percentage would be (X / Z) * 100%.For the entities that sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, we would need to know their individual sales counts. If the store sold W yellow balls and W white balls, then both the yellow and white ball sellers are equal in quantity.Before the sales began, the store started with Z yellow golf balls. This value was mentioned earlier as the total inventory.The store sold all its white golf balls at a certain point, which means the remaining inventory is only yellow balls. Since Y white balls were sold and there were no white balls left, the store sold Y white balls in total.To find out how many white golf balls were there initially, we can simply subtract the number of white balls sold from the total inventory of white balls. So, if there were initially Y white balls in stock, all of them were sold, making the initial count Y.In summary:- The total number of golf balls sold is X + Y.- The percentage of yellow balls sold is (X / Z) * 100%.- Entities selling equal numbers of yellow and white balls are those that sold W of each.- The store started with Z yellow balls.- All white balls were sold when Y were left, indicating an initial count of Y white balls.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?
 Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:class, total students, interested in Football, 8%, Cricket, 4/5, Basketball, 10%, remaining students, not interested in any games, 20 students..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball?2. How many students are interested in both Football and Cricket, if we know the individual percentages?3. What is the total number of students who are interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball?4. In which format (fraction or decimal) is the interest in Cricket given, and how can we convert it to a percentage to compare with the other sports?5. If the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, how many students are there in the class who are interested in at least one sport?6. Using the information provided, what algebraic equation can be set up to find the total number of students in the class, and what are the variables involved?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total percentage of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, you would need to add the individual percentages of each sport and then express the sum as a percentage of the total class population. For example, let's assume the percentages are F for Football (25%), C for Cricket (35%), and B for Basketball (40%). The total percentage would be calculated using the formula:Total Percentage = (F + C + B) / 100For the second question, if we know the number of students interested in each sport, we would subtract the intersection (students interested in both Football and Cricket) from the sum of the individual counts. Let's say there are 60 students interested in Football, 70 in Cricket, and x students in both. The equation to find x would be:60 (Football) + 70 (Cricket) - x (Both) = Total Students interested in Football and CricketTo find the total number of students interested in either Football, Cricket, or Basketball, you would add the percentages without considering the overlap and then multiply by the total class size. If the class has N students, the calculation would be:Total interested = N * (F + C + B - Both)The interest in Cricket is given as a decimal, say 0.35. To convert this to a percentage, you multiply by 100:Percentage Cricket = 0.35 * 100If there are 20 students not interested in any games, the number of students interested in at least one sport would be the total class size minus the 20 non-interested students.Finally, to find the total number of students using algebra, let's denote the total class size as S. If F, C, and B represent the percentages as decimals, the equation would be:S * (F + C + B) = Total students interested in all sports + 20 (non-interested students)So, the algebraic equation to find the total number of students (S) would be:S = (Total students interested + 20) / (F + C + B)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:candidate, secured 504 marks, maximum mark of M, converted into 800 marks, secured 420 marks, value of M.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How do I convert the maximum mark of M to 800 marks?2. What is the relationship between the original marks and the converted marks?3. Can I solve for the value of M using algebra?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
To convert the maximum mark of M to 800 marks, you would divide the original marks by the ratio of the original maximum mark (M) to the new maximum mark (800). That is, if the original marks are x, the converted marks would be (x/M) * 800.
The relationship between the original marks and the converted marks is given by the problem statement: if the candidate originally scored 504 marks, the candidate would have scored 420 marks after conversion.
Using algebra, we can create an equation based on the relationship between the original marks and the converted marks:
(504/M) * 800 = 420
Now, we can solve for M:

504 * 800 = 420 * M
403200 = 420 * M
M = 403200 / 420
M = 960

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Question:If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:120, reduced to, 96, reduction percent..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the "reduced to" indicate in this context?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate the reduction percent?3. Who typically performs this type of calculation (percentage change)?4. In what situation would you apply this formula (percentage reduction)?5. When calculating a reduction percentage, what are the two main values needed (original amount and reduced amount)?6. How do you find the reduction percent if the original value is 120 and the final value is 96?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The term "reduced to" in this context indicates a subtraction or decrease operation, specifically a percentage decrease. To calculate the reduction percentage, we use the formula for percentage change, which is:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Amount} - \text{Reduced Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]This type of calculation is typically performed by individuals or businesses needing to determine the extent of a decrease in value, such as when comparing prices before and after a sale, budget cuts, or stock market fluctuations. The formula is applicable when there's a need to express the change as a percentage of the original quantity.To find the reduction percentage given that the original value is 120 and the final value is 96, we plug these numbers into the formula:\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{120 - 96}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = \left( \frac{24}{120} \right) \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100\% \]\[ \text{Reduction Percentage} = 20\% \]So, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%.

Question:The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retail price, wholesale cost, original retail price, sold for, 20 percent less.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation did the original retail price have compared to the wholesale cost? 2. How much was the original retail price when it was 60% more than the wholesale cost? 3. What percentage decrease was applied to the original retail price during the sale? 4. What was the selling price after the 20% discount on the original retail price? 5. In terms of the wholesale cost, by how much did the selling price exceed it? 6. Which answer choice represents the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The original retail price had a 60% markup compared to the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price when it was 60% more, you would calculate it as follows:Wholesale Cost = BaseOriginal Retail Price = Wholesale Cost + (Wholesale Cost * 60%)For the given problem, let's assume the wholesale cost is \( W \). The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
 Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:retailer, appliance, 40 percent above cost, gross profit of $20.00, selling price.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which percentage increase in cost represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance?2. What is the cost price of the appliance if it was sold for 40% above cost?3. How much did the retailer pay for the appliance initially?4. If the selling price is 40% above the cost, what is the formula to calculate the selling price?5. Given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, how do you find the actual selling price of the appliance?6. Which of the answer choices corresponds to the selling price when the retailer had a $20.00 gross profit from selling the appliance at 40% above cost?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the percentage increase in cost that represents a $20.00 gross profit on an appliance, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 \]Given a $20.00 gross profit, let's call the cost price \( C \). The profit percentage would be:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]For the second question, if the appliance was sold for 40% above cost, the selling price (\( SP \)) can be calculated as:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 40\%) \]The third question asks for the initial cost, which we don't have directly. However, we can use the information from the first question's formula to find the cost if we know the profit percentage and the gross profit.For the fourth question, the formula for calculating the selling price when the markup is 40% is:\[ SP = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Cost Price} \times 0.40) \]To find the actual selling price given a 40% profit margin and a $20.00 profit, we can rearrange the profit percentage formula to solve for the selling price:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) = C \times (1 + 0.40) \]And finally, to answer the last question, we need to plug in the $20.00 profit into the selling price formula for the 40% markup:\[ SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) = 20 \]Now, solving for \( C \), we get:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \]Let's perform the calculations step by step:1. For the profit percentage:\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{C} \right) \times 100 \]2. For the selling price with a 40% markup:\[ SP = C + (C \times 0.40) \]3. Solving for \( C \) given the $20.00 profit:\[ C = \frac{20}{1.40} \approx 14.29 \]The passage:To calculate the percentage increase in cost for a $20.00 gross profit, we use the formula Profit Percentage = (Gross Profit / Cost Price) * 100, where the cost price is \( C \). When an appliance is sold for 40% above cost, the selling price \( SP \) can be found by multiplying the cost by 1.40. To find the initial cost \( C \) given a $20.00 profit with a 40% profit margin, we rearrange the formula to \( SP = C \times (1 + 0.40) \) and solve for \( C \) using the profit ($20) and the markup (1.40). After calculating, we find that the cost price \( C \) is approximately $14.29. This corresponds to a selling price of $20.00 with a 40% markup over the cost price.

Question:Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
 Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jerry, 1-year bond, $5,000, annual interest rate, 12%, compounded every six months, interest accrued, maturity..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation is used to calculate compound interest for this bond?2. What is the formula for compound interest when the interest is compounded semi-annually?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest payment schedule for this bond?4. In what context does the interest accrual occur (e.g., bank, investment firm)?5. When does the interest start accruing, and when does it stop during the 1-year period?6. How much interest would be earned on a $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate if compounded every six months?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To calculate the compound interest for the given bond, we need to utilize the appropriate formula. Compound interest is a powerful concept that allows interest to accumulate not only on the principal amount but also on the accumulated interest over time. For a bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, the formula to calculate compound interest when interest is compounded semi-annually (twice a year) is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Here, A stands for the future value of the bond, P is the principal amount ($5,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.12 or 12%), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual compounding), and t is the time in years (1).Let's plug in the values:A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)A = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2Now, we perform the calculation:A ≈ 5000(1.06)^2A ≈ 5000 * 1.1236A ≈ $5,618So, the interest earned on the $5,000 bond after one year with semi-annual compounding at a 12% annual rate would be approximately $618.The responsibility for determining the interest payment schedule typically lies with the issuer of the bond, which could be a financial institution or an investment firm. The interest accrues continuously throughout the year, and for a 1-year period, it starts accruing from the day the bond is purchased and stops accruing just before the maturity date or the next coupon payment, whichever comes first. In this case, since we are calculating the total interest for the entire year, we assume it accrues until the end of the 1-year period.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:income, 70% of income, income increases by 20%, new expenditure.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first to find out the man's expenditure before the income increase?2. What mathematical formula can be used to calculate 70% of the man's initial income?3. How does the increase in income by 20% affect the original 70% expenditure?4. What operation should be done to the initial expenditure after the income increase to find the new expenditure?5. In what context does the 20% increase apply - as a percentage of the original income or the increased income?6. Which answer choice represents the correct proportion of the man's new income that he would spend after the 20% increase?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the man's expenditure before the income increase, we need to perform an operation on his initial income. To find 70% of his income, we can use the formula:\[ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Initial Income} \times \frac{70}{100} \]Let's assume his initial income is \( I \). So, the expenditure would be \( 0.70I \).When the income increases by 20%, the new income \( I' \) becomes:\[ I' = I + (20\% \times I) = I + 0.20I = 1.20I \]The 20% increase applies to the original income. Now, to find out how this affects the original 70% expenditure, we can calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the increased income:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{0.70I}{1.20I} \times 100\% \]Simplifying this, we get:\[ \text{New Expenditure} = \frac{70}{120} \times 100\% \approx 58.33\% \]After the income increase, if we want to find the new total expenditure, we add the 20% increase to the original 70%:\[ \text{New Total Expenditure} = 0.70I + 0.20I = 0.90I \]In conclusion, to find the man's expenditure before the income increase, we use the formula \( 0.70I \). After a 20% income increase to \( 1.20I \), the proportion of the new income spent is approximately 58.33%. The new total expenditure is \( 0.90I \), which is 90% of the increased income.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Can we express the original amount invested as a multiple of the final amount received?7. What is the closest match between the original amount invested and the answer choices provided?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the original amount invested, we need to use the formula for compound interest when interest is compounded semi-annually. The formula is:A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)Where:A is the final amount receivedP is the principal amount (original investment)r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal)n is the number of times interest is compounded per yeart is the time in yearsFirst, let's determine the number of times interest is compounded per year for this investment. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, it means the interest is compounded twice a year.Next, we can set up the equation using the given values:A = $54,080r = 0.08n = 2t = 1Plugging in these values, we get:A = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)A = P(1.04)^2Now, we need to solve for P:A/P = (1.04)^2P = A / ((1.04)^2)P = $54,080 / (1.04)^2P ≈ $50,000The original amount invested was approximately $50,000.

Question:A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A bag, candy bars, 11 candy bars, three 50 cents each, four $1 each, four $2 each..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What are the different types of candy bars in the bag?2. How much: How much does each type of candy bar cost?3. Which: Which operation should be performed to find the total cost of the three 50-cent candy bars?4. How much: How much does the combination of four $1 candy bars cost?5. Which: Which operation should be used to find the total cost of the four $2 candy bars?6. How much: What is the total cost of all 11 candy bars combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a bag of assorted candy bars, there are various types to choose from. The first type is a 50-cent candy bar, which comes in three different flavors. To find the total cost of these three candy bars, you would perform a simple multiplication, as each costs 50 cents and there are three of them. That calculation would be:3 (candy bars) * $0.50 (cost per bar) = $1.50Moving on to another type, there are four $1 candy bars, each equally priced. The total cost for these can be calculated by multiplying the price per bar by the quantity:4 ($1 candy bars) * $1.00 (cost per bar) = $4.00Lastly, there are four $2 candy bars. To determine the total cost of these, we again multiply the price per bar by the number:4 ($2 candy bars) * $2.00 (cost per bar) = $8.00Now, to find the combined total cost of all 11 candy bars, we simply add the totals from the three groups together:$1.50 (50-cent bars) + $4.00 (1 dollar bars) + $8.00 (2 dollar bars) = $13.50So, the total cost of all 11 candy bars combined is $13.50.

Question:If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?
 Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:bottles of soda, A cents, B bottles, cost in dollars..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the cost per bottle of soda in cents?2. How can we calculate the cost of one bottle if we know the total cost for 27 bottles?3. What is the relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle that we need to establish?4. Who or what is the unit of measurement we're converting from (cents) when determining the cost in dollars?5. In what context does the conversion from cents to dollars take place? Is it a general pricing scenario or a specific situation?6. Why do we need to convert the cost from cents to dollars? Is it to compare with another price or for a specific financial transaction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the cost per bottle of soda in cents, you would need to perform the division operation. If you have the total cost for 27 bottles, say $5.40, you can calculate the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. The formula would be: Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles. In this case, it's $5.40 / 27.The relationship between the cost of 27 bottles and the cost of a single bottle is that the total cost is divided by the unit quantity to find the individual unit price. This helps in understanding the cost structure and making comparisons.When converting from cents to dollars, the unit of measurement we're converting from is cents, which is a subunit of a dollar. This conversion takes place in the context of general pricing scenarios or when comparing prices, as it allows for a more easily understandable figure in the standard currency unit.Converting the cost from cents to dollars is necessary for clear communication and to facilitate financial transactions, such as calculating the price per item for a customer or for record-keeping purposes. It allows for a direct comparison with other dollar-based prices and avoids confusion due to differing units.

Question:I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:money pouch, Rs. 700, 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, one rupee coins.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of coin denominations are present in the money pouch?2. How much: How many of each coin denomination (25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee) does the pouch contain if the total amount is Rs. 700?3. How: Can you express the total value in rupees using the given coin values? 4. Who: If the owner wants to divide the coins equally, who would receive them?5. Where: In what context or situation does this problem arise, like a bank, a store, or personal finances?6. Why: Why is it important to know the exact distribution of coins, considering they all have different values?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a money pouch, the owner holds a mix of coin denominations to facilitate transactions. The pouch contains three types of coins: 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee. To determine the exact count for each, let's denote the number of 25 paise coins as x, 50 paise coins as y, and one rupee coins as z. Given that the total amount is Rs. 700, we can write the following equation based on their respective values:25p * x + 50p * y + 100p * z = 700Since 1 rupee is equivalent to 100 paise, we can simplify the equation to:25x + 50y + z = 7000 paiseTo find the distribution, we need to find integer solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy this equation. Let's assume that x is a multiple of 25 (as it represents the number of 25 paise coins), and since the total is divisible by 100, y should also be a multiple of 50 to ensure the divisibility by 1000.After trying out possible combinations, we find that one solution could be:x = 20 (25 paise coins)y = 12 (50 paise coins)z = 10 (one rupee coins)This adds up to 20 * 25 paise + 12 * 50 paise + 10 * 100 paise = 500 paise + 600 paise + 1000 paise = 2100 paise, which is close but not exactly 7000 paise. However, there might be a mistake in our assumption or an additional constraint. Upon re-evaluation, we realize that to reach exactly 7000 paise, we can adjust the counts slightly:x = 24 (25 paise coins)y = 10 (50 paise coins)z = 16 (one rupee coins)Now, the total value equals 24 * 25 + 10 * 50 + 16 * 100 = 600 + 500 + 1600 = 7000 paise.If the owner divides the coins equally among four people, each person would receive a share of:x/4, y/4, and z/4 coins, respectively.This scenario arises in personal finances, possibly when dividing tips or organizing a collection. Knowing the exact distribution of coins with different values is crucial because it ensures fairness and prevents any confusion or disputes over the division of wealth. Additionally, having a clear breakdown helps keep track of financial transactions and can be helpful for tax purposes or record-keeping.

Question:You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:purchase, one soda, two energy bars, 150 cents, two sodas, three energy bars, 300 cents.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What is being purchased - sodas and energy bars?2. How much: How much does it cost to buy one soda and two energy bars?3. How much: How much does it cost to buy two sodas and three energy bars?4. How: How can we use the given information to determine the individual prices of sodas and energy bars?5. Who: Who benefits from knowing the individual prices of sodas and energy bars?6. Why: Why is it important to know the individual prices rather than just the combined cost?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:To understand the purchasing options better, let's create equations based on the given information:

Let "s" represent the cost of one soda and "e" represent the cost of one energy bar.

From the first option:
1s + 2e = 150 cents

From the second option:
2s + 3e = 300 cents

We now have two linear equations with two variables (s and e). We can solve for s and e by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2s + 3e) - (1s + 2e) = 300 cents - 150 cents
s + e = 150 cents

Now we can substitute the expression for "s + e" back into either of the original equations to solve for the individual prices. Let's use the first equation:

1s + 2e = 150 cents
1s + 2e = 150 cents
1s = 150 cents - 2e
s = 150 cents - 2e

Substituting s = 150 cents - 2e into the expression s + e = 150 cents gives us:

(150 cents - 2e) + e = 150 cents
150 cents - e = 150 cents
e = 150 cents - 150 cents
e = 0 cents

This result suggests that the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents, which is not possible. There seems to be an error in the given information or the question itself. Please double-check the values provided and try solving the problem again.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

The original retail price would be:\( Original\ Retail\ Price = W + (W * 0.60) = 1.60W \)During the sale, a 20% discount was applied to the original retail price. The selling price \( SP \) can be calculated as:\( SP = Original\ Retail\ Price - (Original\ Retail\ Price * 20\%) = 1.60W - (1.60W * 0.20) = 1.28W \)To find the percentage decrease from the original retail price to the selling price, you would use the formula:\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Original\ Retail\ Price - Selling\ Price}{Original\ Retail\ Price} \right) * 100\% \)\( Decrease\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.60W - 1.28W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.32W}{1.60W} \right) * 100\% = 20\% \)The selling price after the discount exceeds the wholesale cost by:\( Excess = SP - Wholesale\ Cost = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \)Finally, to find the percentage increase of the selling price over the wholesale cost, you would use the formula:\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Selling\ Price - Wholesale\ Cost}{Wholesale\ Cost} \right) * 100\% \)\( Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) * 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) * 100\% = 28\% \)In summary, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost, and the selling price after a 20% discount was 28% higher than the wholesale cost. The selling price exceeded the wholesale cost by 28%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? Answer Choices: (A) y/400 (B) 4y (C) 50y (D) 2500/y (E) 5000/y
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:m, y, x, m percent of 4y, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of "m percent of 4y"?2. How do I express m in terms of x?3. What is the relationship between m and x, expressed as a percentage?4. What is the final expression for m as a percentage of x in terms of y?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:1. "m percent of 4y" means m multiplied by 4y divided by 100: \( m\%\ of\ 4y = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y = \frac{4my}{100} \).2. To express m in terms of x, we know that x is equal to m percent of 4y, so we can write: \( x = \frac{4my}{100} \). Solving for m, we get: \( m = \frac{x \times 100}{4y} \).3. We want to find the relationship between m and x as a percentage. This means we need to express m as a fraction of x, multiply by 100, and simplify. So, we will substitute the expression for m from step 2 into the equation: \( \frac{m}{x} \times 100 = \frac{\frac{x \times 100}{4y}}{x} \times 100 = \frac{x \times 100}{x \times 4y} \times 100 = \frac{100}{4y} \times 100 = \frac{2500}{y} \).4. The final expression for m as a percentage of x in terms of y is \( \frac{2500}{y} \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

Question:At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

What is the exact amount of interest earned during the specified period?7. What formula should be used to calculate the interest rate?8. How do you express the interest rate as a percentage?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the given scenario, a professor borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university received Rs. 300 as interest. To find the annual interest rate, we can use the formula for simple interest: Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × TimeWhere: Principal = Rs. 5000Rate = R (the unknown interest rate)Time = 3 yearsGiven: Simple Interest = Rs. 300We can now solve for R: 300 = 5000 × R × 3\[ R = \frac{300}{5000 \times 3} \] \[ R = \frac{300}{15000} \] \[ R = 0.02 \]Converting the interest rate to a percentage: R = 0.02 × 100%\[ R = 2\% \]

Question:IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
 Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:gallon of soft drink, 40% orange juice, 60% water, additional gallons of orange juice, 60% of the soft drink..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink?2. What percentage of the soft drink is orange juice after mixing additional gallons?3. Who or what determines the initial ratio of orange juice to water in the soft drink?4. Where does the change in the orange juice percentage occur - before or after mixing additional gallons?5. When does the need to add more orange juice arise - during the production or when adjusting the recipe?6. How many parts of the original soft drink need to be replaced with orange juice to achieve a 60% orange juice content?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the production of soft drink, the initial ratio of orange juice to water is determined by the manufacturer's recipe, ensuring a balanced flavor profile. To find out the current amount of orange juice in a gallon of soft drink, one would typically refer to this predetermined ratio. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for 30% orange juice. If you have a 1-gallon batch, there would be 0.3 gallons (30%) of orange juice.When additional gallons are mixed, the percentage of orange juice changes. If you're adding pure water without any additional orange juice, the percentage will decrease proportionally. To calculate the new percentage after mixing, let x be the number of gallons added. The new total volume (V_total) would be 1 + x, and the orange juice volume remains at 0.3 gallons. The new percentage (P_new) can be found using the formula:\[ P_{new} = \left(\frac{0.3}{V_{total}}\right) \times 100\% \]To achieve a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to adjust the recipe or dilute the existing mixture. Let y be the number of gallons of the original soft drink that needs to be replaced with orange juice. The equation for this scenario becomes:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6(1 + y) \]Solving for y gives us the amount of original soft drink to replace with orange juice:\[ 0.3 + 0.6y = 0.6 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.6 - 0.3 \]\[ 0.6y = 0.3 \]\[ y = \frac{0.3}{0.6} \]\[ y = 0.5 \text{ gallons} \]So, to reach a 60% orange juice content, you'd need to replace half a gallon of the original mixture with orange juice, ensuring that the recipe is adjusted accordingly during production or when altering the composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A man wants to eat fruit for breakfast and vegetable for dinner. He has 6 different types of fruit and 8 different types of vegetables. He can only eat one type at a time. In how many ways can he eat breakfast and dinner.
 Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 24 (C) 48 (D) 20 (E) 36
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, eat, fruit (breakfast), vegetable (dinner), 6 different types of fruit, 8 different types of vegetables, eat one type at a time..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to calculate the total number of combinations when selecting one type of fruit for breakfast?2. How many choices does the man have for his breakfast considering he can only pick one type of fruit?3. What mathematical concept is needed to find the number of ways to choose one type of vegetable for dinner?4. How many choices does the man have for his dinner with the restriction of eating one type of vegetable?5. To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, what operation combines the fruit selection and vegetable selection?6. What is the final answer choice that represents the total number of ways the man can eat breakfast and dinner according to the given options?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the total number of combinations for the man's breakfast and dinner, we'll apply combinatorial principles. When selecting one type of fruit for breakfast, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or "n choose k," where n is the total number of items and k is the number to be chosen. If there are m types of fruits available, then the calculation for breakfast would be C(m, 1), which simplifies to m since you're choosing just one fruit from m options.For dinner, the situation is similar, but with vegetables instead. If there are p types of vegetables, the calculation for dinner combinations would be C(p, 1), which also equals p because you're picking one vegetable out of p.To find the overall number of combinations for both meals, we combine the results from breakfast and dinner using multiplication, since each meal is independent of the other. The formula for combined combinations is:Total combinations = Breakfast combinations × Dinner combinationsTotal combinations = m (fruit combinations) × p (vegetable combinations)Given the provided options, if the correct answer choice is among the options, it will be the result of this multiplication: m * p.However, without the specific values for m (number of fruit types) and p (number of vegetable types), we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. The passage above outlines the process for arriving at the final answer once those values are known.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
 Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Jim, dog's bowl, dog food, 8:00 am, once an hour, 1/3 of the dog food, each feeding session, noon, original food, percentage..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the consumption of 1/3 of the dog food at each feeding session?2. How many feeding sessions does the dog have between 8:00 am and noon?3. What is the relationship between the time interval and the frequency of the dog's feedings?4. At what time does the dog consume its first meal, and how much food is left after that?5. How much food is consumed at each feeding session in terms of the total amount of food?6. To find the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, what calculation should be performed using the information gathered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The consumption pattern of the dog's food can be represented mathematically as follows. If the dog eats 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, this indicates a division operation, specifically dividing the total amount of food by 3 to determine the quantity consumed per session. To calculate the number of feeding sessions between 8:00 am and noon, we need to consider the typical duration of each feeding. Assuming the dog is fed every 4 hours, from 8:00 am to noon (which is 4 hours later) would consist of one full feeding. Therefore, there is 1 feeding session during this time frame.The relationship between the time interval and the frequency of feedings can be described as a fixed interval; the dog's meals are scheduled at regular intervals regardless of the elapsed time.At 8:00 am, the dog consumes its first meal. Since it consumes 1/3 of the food at each session, if the total amount of food is F, then the amount left after the first meal would be F - (1/3)F = (2/3)F.To find out how much food is consumed at each feeding session as a percentage of the total, we use the formula: (1/3) * 100%. This means that 33.33% of the total food is consumed per session.Finally, to determine the percentage of the original food remaining before noon, we take the remaining amount after the first feeding (2/3)F and divide it by the original amount F, then multiply by 100%: ((2/3)F / F) * 100%. After simplifying, this equals approximately 66.67%.In summary, the dog consumes 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, has 1 feeding between 8:00 am and noon, and the feedings occur at a fixed 4-hour interval. After the first meal at 8:00 am, 2/3 of the food remains, representing 66.67% of the original amount before noon.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:vitamin E, 9 percent, minimum daily requirement, vitamin A, 8 percent, no other source, grams, health food, daily, minimum daily requirement, both vitamins..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How much of the daily requirement of vitamin E is contained in one gram of the health food?2. How much of the daily requirement of vitamin A is contained in one gram of the health food?3. Is it possible to obtain the daily requirements of both vitamins solely from the health food?4. What is the minimum amount of health food required to meet the daily requirement of vitamin E?5. What is the minimum amount of health food required to meet the daily requirement of vitamin A?6. What is the greater value between the two amounts calculated in steps 4 and 5? This will represent the minimum amount of health food necessary to satisfy both vitamin requirements simultaneously.
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:First, we need to know the percentages of vitamins E and A in one gram of the health food. According to the passage, one gram contains 9 percent of the daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the daily requirement of vitamin A.Next, we need to determine whether the health food can provide the daily requirements of both vitamins exclusively. The passage states that no other sources of vitamins E and A will be considered, so the health food must meet all of the daily requirements on its own.Finding the minimum amount of health food required to meet the daily requirement of vitamin E involves calculating the total grams of health food needed to equal 100 percent of the daily requirement, based on the 9 percent provided in one gram. Similarly, finding the minimum amount of health food required to meet the daily requirement of vitamin A requires calculating the total grams of health food needed to equal 100 percent of the daily requirement, based on the 8 percent provided in one gram.Finally, we compare the values obtained in steps 4 and 5. Whichever value is greater represents the minimum amount of health food necessary to satisfy both vitamin requirements simultaneously.

Question:A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Rs 8600, 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews, each daughter, four times as much, each nephew, each son, five as much, each nephew..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does each daughter's amount represent compared to each nephew's share?2. How many times more than a nephew's share does each daughter receive?3. How much does each nephew receive if we know that each son gets five times as much?4. How much does each son receive in terms of a nephew's share?5. How are the total amounts distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews? 6. What is the total amount that all the nephews receive combined?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Each daughter's amount represents 5 times the share of each nephew, according to the given relationship. To find out how many times more than a nephew's share they receive, we can set up the following calculation:If a son gets five times as much as a nephew (denoted by \( S = 5N \)), then a daughter's share (\( D \)) would be 5 times that of her nephew's (\( D = 5N \)). Therefore, the daughters receive 5 times more than a nephew's share.Now, if a son receives \( S = 5N \), we can determine the nephew's share (\( N \)) by dividing the son's share by 5:\( N = \frac{S}{5} \)Since we know that each son gets \( S = 5 \) times the nephew's share, a nephew receives \( N = 1 \) unit.To find out how much each son receives in terms of a nephew's share, we simply use the ratio:\( S \) in terms of \( N \): \( S = 5N \)The total distribution among the sons, daughters, and nephews can be represented as follows:- Sons: \( S \times \text{(number of sons)} \)- Daughters: \( D \times \text{(number of daughters)} = 5N \times \text{(number of daughters)} \)- Nephews: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} = 1 \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)The total amount that all the nephews receive combined is just their individual shares multiplied by the number of nephews:Total nephew's share: \( N \times \text{(number of nephews)} \)Without specific numerical values for the number of sons, daughters, and nephews, we cannot provide exact figures for the total amounts. However, the relationships and calculations described above can be applied to any given scenario.

Question:Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
 Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Arjun, Sajal, money, Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation does the problem involve when Arun gives $30 to Sajal, making Sajal have twice the amount left with Arjun?2. What is the relationship between the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have after the first transaction? 3. Who will have more money initially, Arjun or Sajal, based on the given conditions?4. In the second transaction, how much does Arjun have after Sajal gives him $10?5. What is the condition that must be met for Arjun to have thrice as much money as Sajal after Sajal gives him $10?6. Using the answer choices provided, which option correctly represents the initial amount of money Arjun and Sajal each had before any transactions took place?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: When Arun transfers $30 to Sajal, the problem involves a subtraction followed by multiplication. This is because if Sajal ends up with twice the amount left with Arjun after receiving $30, it implies that Arjun initially had an amount that, when halved, equals the $30 received by Sajal. Let's denote Arjun's initial amount as A and Sajal's initial amount as B.1. After Arun's transfer, Sajal has B + $30, and since this is twice what Arjun has, we can write the equation:   \( B + 30 = 2(A - 30) \)2. The relationship between Arjun and Sajal's amounts after the first transaction is that Sajal has twice as much as Arjun (A - 30).3. To determine who had more initially, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Arjun's initial amount:   \( A = B + 30 / 2 + 30 \)   Since Sajal receives $30, Arjun must have had more than $30 initially.4. In the second transaction, Sajal gives Arjun $10. After this, Arjun's total would be:   \( A' = A - 30 + 10 \)5. For Arjun to have thrice as much as Sajal after Sajal's second gift, the condition would be:   \( A' = 3(B + 10) \)   We know A' from step 4, so we can substitute and find the value of B.6. To find the initial amounts, we need to solve the equation derived from step 1 for A and B. However, without specific numerical values for either A or B, we cannot provide a unique answer choice. The correct representation of their initial amounts would be in terms of B, with Arjun having a higher amount due to the transfer.In conclusion, the passage describes a series of transactions involving Arjun and Sajal, with equations connecting their initial and final amounts. The exact values depend on the initial amounts they had, but the relationships and calculations are presented above.

 Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:6% per annum, simple interest, Rahul, Rs. 500, amount, debt, after 4 years..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which rate of interest is used in the problem?2. What type of interest is mentioned for calculating the amount?3. Who is the borrower in this situation?4. How much money did Rahul borrow initially?5. In how many years does Rahul need to clear the debt?6. What is the formula for calculating simple interest that we need to apply?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Rahul found himself in a financial situation where he needed to borrow money from a lending institution. The problem specifies that the rate of interest used for the calculation is simple interest, which is a common type of interest applied on loans without compounding. To find out the details, we know that Rahul borrowed an initial amount of Rs. 50,000. The loan had an annual interest rate of 8%, and Rahul agreed to repay the debt over a period of 5 years.The formula for calculating simple interest is:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]Here, Principal (P) is Rs. 50,000, Rate (R) is 8% or 0.08 in decimal form, and Time (T) is 5 years. Applying the formula:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.08 \times 5 \]Let's calculate the interest amount:\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 50,000 \times 0.4 \]\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 20,000 \]So, after 5 years, Rahul would have to pay back the principal plus the accumulated interest to clear his debt.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Rs. 5100, two sons, Mohan and Sohan, 23 and 24 years old, compound interest, 4% p.a., equal amount at 26 years.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. How do you calculate the amount received after investing at compound interest?2. How long should the investment be made to achieve equality in the shares at 26 years?3. How do you find the difference in the ages of the two sons?4. How do you determine the initial share of Mohan to ensure equality at 26 years?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:1. To calculate the amount received after investing at compound interest, you can use the formula: Amount = Principal × (1 + Rate/100)^Time. Here, Principal is the initial investment, Rate is the annual interest rate, and Time is the duration of the investment in years.2. The time required for both investments to reach equality can be calculated using the difference in their current ages and the target age of 26 years. The older son (Sohan) needs to invest his portion for a shorter duration to achieve equality.3. The difference in their ages is straightforward: Sohan is one year older than Mohan.4. Once you have determined the time difference, you can calculate the amount that Mohan should initially receive. Start by assuming that Sohan's initial share is x, then Mohan's initial share would be (5100 - x). Apply the compound interest formula for both sons, considering their respective time durations, and equate them to find the value of x.

After performing the calculations, it turns out that Mohan's initial share is indeed 2400 rupees.

Question:A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A man, borrows, Rs.360, 12 monthly installments, Rs.31.50, interest rate..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation calculates the total interest paid over the 12 months?2. What formula would you use to find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed and monthly installment are given?3. Who is responsible for determining the interest rate in this financial transaction?4. In what type of financial agreement does the borrower typically pay interest on the borrowed amount?5. When would the interest be applied to the principal loan amount, at the beginning or end of each month?6. How can you calculate the interest rate if the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments) is known?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a financial transaction involving a loan, the total interest paid over a period of 12 months is calculated using the formula for compound interest, which takes into account the periodic interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded per year. To determine the total interest, one multiplies the monthly installment by the number of installments, as shown: Total Interest = Monthly Installment * Number of Months.To find the interest rate if the total amount borrowed (Principal) and the monthly installment (PMT) are given, you can rearrange the formula for the annuity payment, which is the sum of the present value of the series of payments: Interest Rate = [(PMT * (1 + (Interest Rate / Number of Compounds per Year))) ^ (Number of Years * Number of Compounds per Year)] / Principal - 1.The lender, typically a bank or financial institution, is responsible for setting the interest rate in this financial agreement, which can vary based on factors like market conditions, borrower creditworthiness, and the specific terms of the loan.This type of financial agreement where the borrower pays interest on the borrowed amount is commonly referred to as an installment loan or a loan with fixed payments. In an installment loan, the interest is usually applied either at the beginning of each month (called an 'interest-only' payment) or added to the principal, with the balance repaid over time.If you know the total interest paid (Rs.31.50 per installment * 12 installments), you can calculate the annual interest rate by dividing the total interest by the principal and then converting it to a percentage. Assuming the principal is P and the number of compounds per year is 12 (since we have monthly installments), the formula becomes: Interest Rate = (Total Interest / (P * 12)) * 100%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
 Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:man, Rs. 3500, spends, saves, 12 1/2%, income, monthly income.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the man perform with his savings?2. What percentage of his income does he save from Rs. 3500?3. How much does he save each month based on his spending?4. In terms of arithmetic, how would you calculate his total monthly income if 12 1/2% is saved from it?5. Who is the focus of the calculation, the man or his savings?6. Given the context, where would this calculation be applied in real life (e.g., budgeting)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The passage:In the given scenario, the man practices a disciplined approach to managing his finances. He decides to allocate a portion of his earnings towards savings. Specifically, he saves 12.5% of his monthly income, which amounts to Rs. 3500. To find out what percentage of his income this represents, we can set up the following formula:\[ \text{Savings Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings Amount}}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Plugging in the numbers, we get:\[ 12.5\% = \left( \frac{3500}{\text{Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100 \]Solving for the Monthly Income, we have:\[ \text{Monthly Income} = \frac{3500}{0.125} \]\[ \text{Monthly Income} = 28,000 \]So, the man's total monthly income is Rs. 28,000. With this information, we can determine how much he saves each month by multiplying his monthly income by the savings rate:\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \text{Savings Percentage} \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 12.5\% \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 28,000 \times 0.125 \]\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 3500 \]The focus of the calculation is primarily on the man's financial habits and his monthly income. This kind of calculation would be relevant in real-life situations such as budgeting, personal finance management, or planning for future financial goals. By understanding the proportion of his income going towards savings, the man can make informed decisions about his expenses and investments.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question: Simple Interest, Compound Interest, Rs.5000, 2 years, Rs.72, Rate of Interest.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:
1. How do you calculate Simple Interest?
2. How do you calculate Compound Interest?
3. What is the difference between Simple Interest and Compound Interest?
4. What formula would you use to find the rate of interest?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:

To find the rate of interest, we need to understand the formulas for both Simple Interest and Compound Interest and their relationship.

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:
SI = (P x R x T)/100
Where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

Compound Interest (CI) is calculated using the formula:
CI = P(1 + R/100)^T - P
Where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

The difference between Simple Interest and Compound Interest can be represented as:
Difference = CI - SI

Given that the difference between Simple Interest and Compound Interest for Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72, we can write:
Difference = CI - SI = 72

Now, we need to solve for the rate of interest. We can start by substituting the expressions for CI and SI in terms of P, R, and T into the equation above:

72 = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]

Since P and T are given (P=5000, T=2), we can substitute them into the equation and simplify to find the rate of interest R.

Question:A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?
 Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A grocery, bag of ice, $1.25, 20% profit, 500 bags of ice, total profit..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation represents the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit is applied?2. What percentage increase does the 20% profit represent on the cost price of a bag of ice?3. How much does the grocery spend on one bag of ice, considering the 20% profit margin?4. What is the selling price of one bag of ice if it has a 20% profit margin on a $1.25 cost?5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, how much revenue does it generate from these sales?6. Using the profit percentage and total number of bags sold, how much total profit does the grocery make?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost price per bag of ice before the 20% profit, we first need to determine the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as \( C \). After applying a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) would be \( C + 0.20C = 1.20C \).1. The operation that represents the cost price per bag before the profit is \( C = \frac{Selling\ Price}{1 + Profit\ Percentage} = \frac{1.20C}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{1.20C}{1.20} = C \).The 20% profit represents a percentage increase on the cost price, which can be calculated using the formula:\[ Increase\ Percentage = \left( \frac{Profit\ Amount}{Cost\ Price} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.20C}{C} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \].3. To find the amount spent on one bag of ice with a 20% profit, we simply consider the original cost price, which is $1.25: \( Cost\ per\ bag = $1.25 \).4. The selling price with a 20% profit on a $1.25 cost is \( SP = Cost\ Price + Profit\ Amount = $1.25 + 0.20 \times $1.25 = $1.25 + $0.25 = $1.50 \).5. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice at the selling price of $1.50 each, the revenue generated would be \( Revenue = Number\ of\ Bags \times Selling\ Price = 500 \times $1.50 = $750 \).6. The total profit can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: \( Total\ Profit = Revenue - Total\ Cost = $750 - (500 \times $1.25) = $750 - $625 = $125 \).In conclusion, the cost price per bag before the profit is the same as the cost itself ($1.25), the 20% profit represents a 20% increase on the cost, the grocery spends $1.25 on each bag, the selling price is $1.50, they generate $750 in revenue from 500 bags, and their total profit is $125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:electric pole, height (14 metres), shadow (10 metres), height of a tree, shadow (15 metres).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the tree based on the relationship between the pole's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the pole and its shadow compared to the height of the tree and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the tree's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the tree with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a tree based on the pole's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle.The entities in this situation are the pole and the tree, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the pole (H_pole) and its corresponding shadow (S_pole), as well as the height of the tree's shadow (S_tree), you can use the following formula to calculate the tree's height (H_tree):H_tree = H_pole * (S_tree / S_pole)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the tree's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_tree_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (pole shadow to tree shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_pole / S_treeThen, apply this ratio to the new tree shadow length:H_tree_prime = H_pole * (S_tree_prime / S_pole)By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the tree's height accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
 Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:cost, gardening, 1-metre broad boundary, rectangular plot, perimeter, 340 metres, rate, 10 per square metre.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the total area to be gardened?2. What mathematical procedure should be followed to calculate the length and width of the rectangular plot?3. Who is responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate?4. In what type of setting does this cost calculation take place (e.g., residential, commercial)?5. Assuming no change in rates, when would the cost calculation be applicable (i.e., immediate or during a specific period)?6. How much would the cost be if the cost per square meter remained constant at 10?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To find the total area to be gardened, you would perform an addition operation, as the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The mathematical procedure for determining the dimensions of the rectangular plot involves rearranging the formula for area: if the total area (A) is given, you can use A = length × width to find the length when the width is known, or vice versa, by dividing the area by the other dimension.Once the dimensions are calculated, the person responsible for determining the cost based on the area and rate is typically the homeowner or the contractor, depending on the context. In a residential setting, this cost calculation takes place when planning a landscaping project or deciding on a gardening budget.Assuming no changes in rates, this cost calculation would be applicable immediately after obtaining the area and the rate per square meter. For instance, if the rate remains constant at 10 dollars per square meter, the cost (C) can be calculated using the formula C = area × rate. If the total area to be gardened is 100 square meters, the cost would be:C = 100 square meters × $10/square meter = $1000.So, the passage detailing the process is as follows:To find the total area to be gardened, simply add the length and width of the plot. To determine the dimensions, knowing the area (A), use the formula A = length × width. The homeowner or contractor would then calculate the cost based on this area and the rate, say $10 per square meter. In a residential setting, this calculation is immediate. For a total area of 100 square meters with a constant rate of $10/square meter, the cost would be $1000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:quadratic equation, x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, root, 1.5, value of m.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What property allows us to find the value of 'm' given one root of the quadratic equation?2. Can we determine the value of 'm' without knowing the second root?3. Is there a general method to find the value of 'm' when given only one root of a quadratic equation?4. What happens if we plug in the given root into the quadratic equation?5. How do we manipulate the resulting equation to isolate 'm'?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Given a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, if one of its roots is r, then the factorization of the quadratic equation becomes (x - r)(x - s) = 0, where s is the other root. Since we know that one of the roots is 1.5, we can write the equation as (x - 1.5)(x - s) = 0. Expanding this expression gives us x^2 - (1.5 + s)x + 1.5s = 0. Comparing this expanded form with the given quadratic equation, we see that the coefficient of x must be equal: - (1.5 + s) = -m. Therefore, we can express 'm' in terms of 's': m = 1.5 + s. But since we don't know the value of 's', we cannot determine the exact value of 'm'. Instead, we can conclude that the value of 'm' depends on the value of 's'.

Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Question:A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet? Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D)  (13x+1) /24 (E)  (13x-12) /24
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:A straight picket fence, x pickets, 1/2 inch wide, 6 inches of space, length of fence in feet, representation, choice among options A to E. 
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How many spaces are there between x pickets?2. What is the total width of all the pickets?3. What is the total width of all the spaces?4. What is the overall width of the fence, including pickets and spaces?5. What is the length of the fence in feet?6. Which option represents the length of the fence correctly?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To construct a picket fence, we need to consider both the pickets themselves and the gaps between them. We have x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide, and 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. We want to find the total length of the fence in feet. First, let's determine the number of spaces between x pickets:There will be x - 1 spaces, as there are no gaps between the first and last pickets. Next, we can calculate the total width of all the pickets:Total width of pickets = (number of pickets) * (width per picket) = x * (1/2 inch)Next, we can calculate the total width of all the spaces:Total width of spaces = (number of spaces) * (width per space) = (x - 1) * 6 inchesNow, we can find the overall width of the fence, including pickets and spaces:Overall width = Total width of pickets + Total width of spacesFinally, we need to convert the overall width from inches to feet, as 1 foot equals 12 inches.Length of fence in feet = Overall width in inches / 12The correct answer should represent this expression in terms of x among the given options.

Question:A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain?
 Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:car, journey, 20 hours, speed of 60 km/hr, distance, 10 hours, speed, gain..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
 Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:$8.50, cab fare, $3.50, first quarter-mile, 10 cents, additional quarter mile, maximum distance..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile?2. How much does the cab charge per additional quarter-mile?3. How many quarter-miles can be traveled with the initial $3.50?4. What is the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile?5. How many times will the additional charge of 10 cents be applied to reach the limit of $8.50?6. What is the maximum distance that can be reached by adding the cost of the first quarter-mile and the additional quarter-mile charges?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the cost for the first quarter-mile, you would use the initial fare, which is $3.50. This covers the first part of the trip. The cab charges an additional 10 cents per quarter-mile after the first one. To find out how many quarter-miles the initial $3.50 covers, you divide the initial fare by the charge per quarter-mile:\( \frac{\$3.50}{\$0.10/quarter-mile} = 35 quarter-miles \)For the formula to determine the total fare after the first quarter-mile, you add the initial charge to the sum of charges for each subsequent quarter-mile up to the point where the fare exceeds the limit of $8.50. Since the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, we need to find out how many times this charge can be applied before reaching $8.50:Let x be the number of additional quarter-miles. The equation will be:\( \$3.50 + (x * \$0.10) = \$8.50 \)Solving for x:\( x = \frac{\$8.50 - \$3.50}{\$0.10} \)\( x = \frac{\$5.00}{\$0.10} \)\( x = 50 quarter-miles \)The additional charge will be applied 50 times to reach the limit.Now, to find the maximum distance that can be reached, we add the first quarter-mile to the total number of additional quarter-miles:\( 1 quarter-mile + 50 quarter-miles = 51 quarter-miles \)So, the total distance is 51 quarter-miles converted to miles, knowing that 1 mile equals 4 quarter-miles:\( 51 \frac{quarter-miles}{4} = 12.75 miles \)In summary, the cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50, the additional charge is 10 cents per quarter-mile, the initial $3.50 covers 35 quarter-miles, the formula for total fare beyond the first mile is the initial fare plus 10 cents per quarter-mile up to 50 quarters, resulting in a total fare of $8.50, and the maximum distance is 12.75 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E

Question:On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches. On this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road? Answer Choices: (A) 800 (B) 720 (C) 960 (D) 1140 (E) 1160
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:map, road, Town F, Town G, 20 inches, 1/4 inch, 10 miles, actual distance, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the scale factor of the map, represented as "actual distance" divided by "map distance"?2. Can we convert the map distance of 20 inches to actual distance using the scale factor?3. Who is involved in the journey from Town F to Town G?4. Where do the towns lie relative to each other?5. When was the map created, and why might it be relevant to finding the actual distance?6. Why is the ratio of 1/4 inch to 10 miles important in solving the problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Given that 1/4 inch on the map represents 10 miles in reality, we can create a proportion to find the actual distance between Town F and Town G, which measures 20 inches on the map. Let D represent the actual distance between Town F and Town G in miles. We can set up the following proportion:1/4 inch : 10 miles :: 20 inches : D milesNow, we can cross-multiply to solve for D:D = (20 inches \* 10 miles) / (1/4 inch)D = (200 miles) / (1/4)D = 200 \* 4D = 800 milesTherefore, the actual distance between Town F and Town G is 800 miles.

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:length of the ribbon, originally 30 cm, reduced, ratio 5 : 3, length now.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What does the phrase "reduced in the ratio 5 : 3" mean?2. How do I use the given ratio to find the new length of the ribbon?3. Can I apply the concept of ratios to find the new length of the ribbon?4. Are there any other methods to find the new length of the ribbon?5. How does the fact that the length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm impact my calculations?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:We are given that the length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm and that it was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. We want to find the current length of the ribbon.

When something is said to be reduced in a certain ratio, it means that the final quantity is obtained by taking a fraction of the original quantity according to the specified ratio. In our case, the ribbon's length is being reduced to 3 parts out of every 5 parts, because the ratio is 5 : 3.

To use the given ratio to find the new length of the ribbon, we first need to identify how many parts of the original length correspond to the 3 parts mentioned in the ratio. In this case, since the original length is 30 cm, we can divide it by 5 to find that each part is equal to 6 cm (30 ÷ 5 = 6).

Now that we know each part is 6 cm long, we can calculate the new length of the ribbon by multiplying the number of parts specified in the ratio (3) by the length of each part (6): 3 × 6 = 18 cm.

Yes, the concept of ratios can be applied to find the new length of the ribbon. By dividing the original length by the total number of parts in the ratio (5), we obtain the length of each part. Then, multiplying the length of each part by the number of parts corresponding to the new length (3) gives us the desired result.

There might be other methods to find the new length of the ribbon, but using ratios provides a straightforward approach based on the information provided.

The fact that the length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm impacts our calculations because it allows us to determine the size of each part in the ratio (6 cm per part). Without this information, we wouldn't be able to calculate the new length accurately.

In conclusion, we can find the new length of the ribbon by applying the concept of ratios. Given that the length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm and it was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3, the new length of the ribbon is 18 cm.

Question:Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
 Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Alice, rectangular yard, three sides, fencing, one side, 10 meters, area, 240 square meters, meters of fencing..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance the car covers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr?2. What formula should be applied to convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed?3. Who or what is the subject that needs to have its speed increased to cover the same distance in 10 hours?4. In what context does the problem take place, involving a car and a journey?5. When would it be necessary to solve this problem, considering the original time frame and the desired change?6. Why is the speed being asked to be increased, and what is the relationship between the original speed and the desired new speed?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a scenario where a car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/hr, one can calculate the distance covered in a given period using the basic concept of speed-distance-time. To find the distance the car would cover in 20 hours, you would apply the formula:Distance = Speed × TimeSo, for the car traveling at 60 km/hr for 20 hours, the distance would be:Distance = 60 km/hr × 20 hours = 1200 kmTo convert the time from hours to kilometers for a constant speed, you use the inverse relationship, which means you divide the time by the speed. If the car maintained the same speed and wanted to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours), the subject that needs to have its speed increased is the car itself.The formula to convert time into distance for the same distance would be:New Time = Original Distance / New SpeedSince we know the distance (1200 km) and the desired new time (10 hours), we can rearrange the formula to find the required new speed:New Speed = Original Distance / New TimeNew Speed = 1200 km / 10 hoursCalculating this, we get:New Speed = 120 km/hrThus, to cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car's speed must be increased from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr. This problem arises when planning a more efficient journey, as the driver aims to save time while maintaining the same endpoint. The need to solve this arises when comparing the initial travel plan with a revised one, where a shorter travel duration is desired.

Question:A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:rope, 20 meters long, cut into two pieces, one piece 3 meters shorter, length of the longer piece, meters, Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. How can we represent the relationship between the two pieces of rope?2. What type of equation can we form from the given information?3. Who or what is the subject in this problem that involves cutting a rope?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., is there any physical constraint or condition?5. When is the rope cut, does it matter whether it's done instantly or over time?6. Why is the length of the longer piece sought after? Is it to ensure equal distribution or for some practical application?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this problem, we're dealing with a 20-meter-long rope that's been cut into two separate pieces. We want to find the length of the longer piece, given that one piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. To represent the relationship between the two pieces, let x denote the length of the longer piece and y the length of the shorter piece. From the problem statement, we can deduce that x = y + 3 and x + y = 20. Solving these equations simultaneously will yield the value of x, which represents the length of the longer piece.

The subject in this problem is the rope, which undergoes a transformation when it's cut into two pieces. There doesn't seem to be any physical constraint or condition affecting the problem, and the time at which the rope is cut doesn't matter. The reason for seeking the length of the longer piece might vary depending on the context; it could be for fairness in dividing resources or simply to satisfy curiosity about the properties of the rope.

By solving the system of equations, we can find the length of the longer piece. First, substitute the expression for x in terms of y from the first equation into the second equation: (y + 3) + y = 20 Simplify: 2y + 3 = 20 Subtract 3 from both sides: 2y = 17 Divide by 2: y = 8.5 Since x = y + 3, then x = 8.5 + 3 = 11.5

Question:A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:wire, rectangle, length 27 cm, breadth 17 cm, form, square, measure, side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the perimeter of the rectangle before it's transformed into a square?2. What calculation should be performed to determine the total length of wire used initially?3. How does the wire need to be reshaped to convert it into a square? 4. Who or what determines the side length of the square after the transformation?5. In which context does the problem take place, i.e., geometry or real-world application?6. When is the transformation from rectangle to square significant, in terms of the problem's underlying principles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In a geometry problem, we are given a rectangle with a known length (L) and width (W). To find the perimeter of the rectangle before transforming it into a square, we first need to apply the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2 × (length + width). So, calculating the perimeter involves adding the lengths of all four sides.To determine the total length of wire used initially, which represents the perimeter of the rectangle, we plug in the dimensions: P = 2 × (L + W). Once we have this value, we proceed with the transformation.To convert the rectangle into a square, the wire needs to be reshaped so that all sides become equal. This requires us to divide the initial wire length by 4, since a square has four equal sides. The side length of the resulting square, s, can be calculated using the formula s = P / 4.The side length of the square is determined by the perimeter of the original rectangle, as it ensures that all sides are equidistant. Therefore, the transformation from rectangle to square signifies a change in shape where the focus shifts from unequal sides to equal sides, reflecting the principles of symmetry and congruence in geometry.This problem takes place within the context of geometry, specifically in the realm of Euclidean plane geometry, where transformations like resizing and reshaping figures are studied. The significance of the transformation lies in understanding the relationship between different geometric shapes and the properties they possess, such as area and perimeter conservation during the process.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:cross-section, trapezium, width at the top, 10 m, width at the bottom, 6 m, area of cross-section, 640 square meters, depth of canal, unknown variable x.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the formula for finding the area of a trapezium?2. How can I express the width of the trapezium in terms of the given values?3. Can I substitute the values of the base widths and the area into the formula to find the height of the trapezium, which represents the depth of the canal?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:In this passage, we are given a canal whose cross-section is shaped like a trapezium. The width at the top is 10 m, the width at the bottom is 6 m, and the area of the cross-section is 640 square meters. We want to find the depth of the canal, represented by the height of the trapezium.

First, let's recall the formula for finding the area of a trapezium:
Area = (base1 + base2) × height / 2

Here, base1 is the width at the top (10 m), base2 is the width at the bottom (6 m), and the height is the depth of the canal, represented by the unknown variable x.

We can now substitute the given values into the formula:
640 = (10 + 6) × x / 2

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:
1280 = 16x

Dividing both sides by 16, we obtain:
x = 80

So, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

Question:Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.
 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Two ants, 4 inches tall ant, shadow, 10 inches long, taller ant, shadow length..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation do we need to perform to find the relationship between the height of the ants and their shadows?2. What is the mathematical formula to calculate the length of a shadow when the height of an object is known, assuming similar light conditions?3. Who is the subject in this scenario that casts a shadow based on its height?4. Where does the problem take place, i.e., what is the reference point for measuring the shadow lengths?5. When does the shadow casting occur, does it matter when it's measured?6. Why are we interested in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow? Is it to compare or scale a situation?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scientific investigation, to determine the relationship between the height of ants and their shadows, one would need to perform a simple ratio calculation. The mathematical formula for calculating the length of a shadow, known as the shadow's linear dimension, under similar light conditions, is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle formed by the object's height (h), the shadow's length (s), and the distance from the light source (d), which can be represented as s = √(h^2 + d^2). The subject in this scenario is the ants, whose varying heights result in corresponding shadows being cast on the ground. The reference point for measuring these shadows is typically the surface where they touch, such as a flat pavement or lawn. To obtain accurate measurements, it is crucial to conduct the observation during the same time of day, as the angle of sunlight affects the shadow's length.The interest in finding the length of the taller ant's shadow lies in understanding the proportional relationship between their size and the light they receive. This comparison could be used to scale situations, estimate distances, or even create a rudimentary measurement system if needed. By analyzing the data, researchers or students can draw conclusions about how shadows change with respect to the height of objects, providing valuable insights into geometry and light dynamics.

Question:A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
 Answer Choices: (A)  13.3542 (B)  15.8113 (C)  18.3451 (D)  19.5667 (E)  20.8888
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, sphere, diameter..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation connects the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter?2. What is the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid?3. Who or what determines the sphere's diameter based on the inscribed rectangular solid?4. In which geometric context does this problem take place - Euclidean space or a non-Euclidean surface?5. When inscribing a rectangular solid into a sphere, what property ensures that all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface?6. How can we calculate the sphere's diameter using the dimensions of the rectangular solid (3 x 4 x 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The problem revolves around the relationship between a rectangular solid and a sphere inscribed within it in Euclidean space. The mathematical operation connecting the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter is the concept of similarity. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the longest diagonal of the solid represents the diameter of the sphere. This relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the three dimensions of the rectangular solid, which states that the square of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two dimensions (l, w, and h): d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2.In this case, let's use the dimensions provided: l = 3 units, w = 4 units, and h = 15 units. Calculating the longest diagonal (d) gives us:d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225d^2 = 250Now, taking the square root of both sides to find the diameter:d = √250 ≈ 15.81 unitsThus, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.81 units, and it is determined by the inscribed rectangular solid's dimensions within a Euclidean context. The property that ensures all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface is known as the 'inscribed property,' which guarantees that the sphere's radius is half the length of the longest diagonal.

Question:A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
The outer surface has no small cubes at all on the top/bottom surfaces, only a single layer on the front/back/side surfaces. There are 5 layers on each of those surfaces, except for the corners, where there are only 4 cubes in depth. There are 4 corners, so 4*4=16 cubes total there. Each of the 4 edges has 5-2=3 layers, so there are 4*3=12 layers total. And finally, the middle has 5 full layers, so 5*5=25 layers. So there are 16+12+25=53 cubes with 2 faces painted, 50 cubes with 1 face painted, and 500 cubes with no faces painted. Total number of painted faces is (2*53)+(1*50)=106+50=156. Number of unpainted faces is 4*(500)=2000. Number of faces per unpainted cube is 6, so total number of unpainted faces is 2000*6=12000. Number of unpainted faces is 12000-156=11844.

Therefore, the answer is (E).

Question:An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
 Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:electric pole, height (14 metres), shadow (10 metres), height of a tree, shadow (15 metres).
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the tree based on the relationship between the pole's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the pole and its shadow compared to the height of the tree and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the tree's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the tree with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a tree based on the pole's height and its shadow, you would use the division operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (shadow) of a right triangle.The entities in this situation are the pole and the tree, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the pole (H_pole) and its corresponding shadow (S_pole), as well as the height of the tree's shadow (S_tree), you can use the following formula to calculate the tree's height (H_tree):H_tree = H_pole * (S_tree / S_pole)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun.To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the tree's shadow were 2 meters longer (S_tree_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (pole shadow to tree shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_pole / S_treeThen, apply this ratio to the new tree shadow length:H_tree_prime = H_pole * (S_tree_prime / S_pole)By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the tree's height accurately.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To calculate the semi-perimeter of the room based on the given height-to-semi-perimeter ratio, you would first express the semi-perimeter (s) in terms of the height (h). Let's denote the ratio as r, so s = hr. If the ratio is provided, you can simply multiply the height by the ratio to find the semi-perimeter.To convert the paper width from centimeters to meters, you would divide the width in centimeters by 100, since there are 100 centimeters in a meter. So, if the paper is 50 cm wide, the width in meters would be 50 / 100 = 0.5 meters.To determine the amount of paper needed to cover the walls, you would multiply the total wall area by the paper's width. Assuming the room has four walls, each with the same height as the semi-perimeter (s), the total width for all walls is 4 * s. The cost calculation would be done by multiplying the total width in meters by the cost per meter, which is Rs.2. Let's assume the area of doors and windows is A square meters. To find out how many square meters need to be excluded, you would subtract A from the total wall area, which is 4 * sh.The cost to paper the walls without considering doors and windows can be found by multiplying the total width (4 * sh) in meters by the cost per meter (Rs.2). If the total cost is Rs.260, you can set up the equation: 4 * s * h * 2 = 260.Finally, to find the total length of the walls that need to be papered, including the area for doors and windows, you would add the area of the doors and windows (A) back to the total wall area after the exclusion. This can be expressed as 4 * s + A. Once you have the total length, you can find the cost by multiplying it by the cost per meter again.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:A flagstaff 17.5 metre high casts a shadow of length 40.25 metre. The height of building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions will be : Answer Choices: (A) 12 metre (B) 12.5 metre (C) 13.5 metre (D) 14 metre (E) 15 metre
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:flagstaff, height (17.5 m), shadow (40.25 m), building, shadow (28.75 m), height of building.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the height of the building based on the relationship between the flagstaff's height and its shadow?2. What formula can be applied to solve this problem, involving the height of the flagstaff and its shadow compared to the height of the building and its shadow?3. Who are the entities in this scenario that have a similar relationship between height and shadow, and how does this similarity help in finding the building's height?4. In what type of situation or context would this problem typically occur, i.e., where shadows are involved?5. Considering the given timeframe, is there any assumption about the time of day or light conditions that would affect the shadow lengths?6. How can we adjust the ratio of the flagstaff's height to its shadow to calculate the height of the building with a different shadow length, using the provided shadow measurements?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:In a scenario where the relationship between the height of an object and its shadow is proportional, to find the height of a building based on the flagstaff's height and its shadow, you would use the multiplication operation. This proportionality can be expressed mathematically through the concept of similar triangles. The formula that applies here is the sine function, which relates the opposite side (height) to the hypotenuse (shadow) of a right triangle. The entities in this situation are the flagstaff and the building, both of which have similar relationships between their heights and shadows due to the angle of elevation from the ground being the same for both. By knowing the height of the flagstaff (H_flagstaff) and its corresponding shadow (S_flagstaff), as well as the height of the building's shadow (S_building), you can use the following formula to calculate the building's height (H_building):H_building = H_flagstaff * (S_building / S_flagstaff)This problem typically occurs in situations where shadows are cast, such as measuring objects outdoors during the day when the sun's position affects the shadow lengths. However, for accurate calculations, it is essential to assume that the light conditions remain constant throughout the measurement, as the angle of the shadows changes with the position of the sun. To adjust the ratio for a different shadow length, say if the building's shadow were 10 meters shorter (S_building_prime), you would first calculate the ratio (flagstaff shadow to building shadow) using the original measurements:Ratio = S_flagstaff / S_building Then, apply this ratio to the new building shadow length:H_building_prime = H_flagstaff * (S_flagstaff_prime / S_flagstaff) By plugging in the values and following these steps, you can determine the building's height accurately.

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2. What is the formula used to calculate the area of a rectangle when given two sides?3. Who is responsible for determining the dimensions of the yard?4. Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:rectangular sheet, folded into two equal halves, perimeter, 48cm, folded along one set of sides, perimeter, 66cm, folded along the other set of sides, area of the sheet.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the meaning of folding a rectangular sheet into two equal halves?2. How do you calculate the perimeter of a rectangle?3. What is the significance of the perimeters being 48cm and 66cm when folded along different sets of sides?4. How can you use the perimeters to find the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet?5. Once you have found the length and breadth, how can you calculate the area of the sheet?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:Passage:When a rectangular sheet is folded into two equal halves, it means that the rectangle is divided into two identical smaller rectangles along one of its long edges (length) or short edges (breadth). Folding the sheet along one set of sides results in a perimeter of 48cm for each part, while folding it along the other set of sides leads to a perimeter of 66cm for each part. These perimeters help in determining the dimensions of the rectangular sheet. By using the formulas for the perimeter of a rectangle (P = 2l + 2b, where l is the length and b is the breadth) and the area of a rectangle (A = lb), we can calculate the area of the sheet once we know its length and breadth.

Question:A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
 Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:train M, City A, 5 am, City B, 9 am, train N, City B, 7 am, City A, 10:30 am.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which: What type of operation do we need to perform to find out when the two trains will cross each other?2. When: At what time does Train M start its journey from City A?3. When: At what time does Train N leave City B?4. How much: How long does it take for Train M to travel from City A to City B?5. How much: How long does it take for Train N to travel from City B to City A?6. When: At what point in time do we need to add the travel times of Train M and subtract the departure time of Train N to find the crossing time?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine when Train M and Train N cross each other, we first need to understand the relative motion problem at hand. We are given that Train M starts its journey from City A at an unknown time, let's denote this as \( t_M \). Train N leaves City B at an unknown time, \( t_N \), and both trains travel towards each other with constant speeds.Train M takes \( T_{MAB} \) hours to travel from City A to City B, and Train N takes \( T_{NBA} \) hours to travel from City B back to City A. To find the crossing time, we can use the formula for the time of相遇 (crossing):\[ t_{cross} = t_M + T_{MAB} - (t_N + T_{NBA}) \]We know that when they cross, they have traveled equal distances, so their relative speed (combined speeds in opposite directions) multiplied by the time of crossing equals the distance between the cities:\[ v_M \cdot t_{cross} = v_N \cdot t_{cross} \]\[ t_{cross} = \frac{Distance_{AB}}{v_M + v_N} \]However, since we don't have the exact values for \( T_{MAB} \), \( T_{NBA} \), \( v_M \), and \( v_N \), we cannot provide an exact time for the crossing. The passage would be incomplete without these specific values. If you can provide the missing information, we can calculate the crossing time using the given speeds and distances.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D

Question:Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school?
 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Winson, home, school, average speed, 10 miles/hr, walk, 5 miles/hr, journey, one hour, miles.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation can be used to find the distance Winson covered at his faster speed (10 mph)?2. What is the formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed when given the speed and time?3. Who is the subject performing the action of traveling at different speeds (Winson)?4. Where does Winson start his journey (home) and where does he end it (school)?5. When does Winson cover the distance at the slower speed (after the first part of the journey)?6. How much time did Winson spend walking home if the entire journey took one hour, considering he ran for the first part?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Winson embarked on a daily journey from his home to school, a distance that required him to travel at varying speeds. To find the distance he covered at his faster speed of 10 mph, we would need to know the duration he maintained this pace. The formula to calculate the distance traveled at a constant speed (d) is:\[ d = speed \times time \]For the first part of the journey, he ran at a different speed, which we don't have specific information about. However, after reaching his faster pace, he maintained 10 mph for the remainder of the trip. If the entire journey took one hour, and we let \( t_{faster} \) be the time spent at the faster speed, then the time spent walking at the slower speed would be \( 1 - t_{faster} \).Let's denote the distance at the slower speed as \( d_{slower} \). Since he walked at the slower speed for the rest of the hour, we can calculate \( d_{slower} \) using the formula:\[ d_{slower} = speed_{slower} \times (1 - t_{faster}) \]Unfortunately, without knowing the speed at which he walked, we cannot provide an exact value for \( d_{slower} \) or \( t_{faster} \). Nonetheless, we have outlined the steps needed to determine these values once the missing information is provided.

Question:A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
 Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:ship, voyage, 180 miles, plane, speed, ship's speed, times, distance when they meet, starting point..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the speed of the plane relative to the ship?2. How many times faster is the plane's speed compared to the ship's speed?3. What is the initial speed of the ship if the plane has 10 times that speed?4. When the plane starts, how far has the ship already traveled?5. In what situation do the ship and the plane meet? (context or setting)6. To find the distance when they meet, which equation or concept should be applied, considering the relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To determine the speed of the plane relative to the ship, we need to perform vector addition, subtracting the ship's speed from the plane's speed. Let's denote the plane's speed as P (in km/h) and the ship's speed as S (also in km/h). If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, we can express this relationship as P = 10S.Now, let's calculate the relative speed (R) using the formula:R = P - SGiven that the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, we substitute P with 10S in the equation:R = 10S - SR = 9SThis means the plane is 9 times faster than the ship.To find the initial speed of the ship, we set R equal to 0 since the plane is starting and therefore their relative speed is zero at that moment:0 = 9SS = 0 km/hHowever, this doesn't make sense because a ship cannot have zero speed. It must be a typo; the actual speed of the ship should be a non-zero value. Assuming the plane's speed is indeed 10 times the ship's speed, we can say that the ship's speed is 1/10th of the plane's speed, or S = P / 10.Next, let's address question 4. Since the context is that the plane starts after the ship has already traveled some distance, we need to know the time it takes for the plane to catch up. Let's denote this time as t (in hours). The distance the ship covers during this time can be calculated using the formula:Distance_S = S * tWhen the plane meets the ship, they will have traveled the same distance. Therefore, the distance the plane covers is also:Distance_P = R * t = 9S * tSince the distances are equal, we can equate them:S * t = 9S * tDividing both sides by S (assuming S ≠ 0), we get:t = 9tThis implies that the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 1/9th of the time it takes for the ship to cover the same distance.To find the distance when they meet, we can use the formula for the ship's distance:Distance_meet = S * (1/9 * t)So, when the plane starts, the ship has already traveled a distance equal to its speed multiplied by 1/9th of the time it takes for the plane to catch up.In conclusion, to find the distance they meet, you would apply the concept of relative motion and the formula for distance with the given relative speeds and the distance the ship has already covered.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:R, S, T, and U, points, line, midpoint, ST, RS, RT, ST, RU, lengths.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed to find the length of RU?2. What is the meaning of "midpoint" in the context of the question?3. What is the relationship between the length of RU and the lengths of RS, RT, and ST?4. Given that U is the midpoint of ST, how can we use this information to find the length of RU?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In this question, we're asked to find the length of line segment RU. To do so, we need to consider the relationships between the various points and segments described in the question.

First, let's define our terms:
- Point R is a point on the line.
- Point S is another point on the line.
- Point T is yet another point on the line.
- Point U is the midpoint of line segment ST.

Now, we know that the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22 units, respectively. Our goal is to find the length of line segment RU.

The key here is understanding that U is the midpoint of line segment ST. This means that US = UT, i.e., the distance between U and S is equal to the distance between U and T. 

Since we want to find the length of RU, we can use the fact that US = UT to simplify the problem. Let's call the length of RU x. Then, we have the following system of equations:

US = UT
x + US = RS
x + UT = RT

From the second and third equations, we can eliminate US and UT, respectively:

x + US = 5
x + UT = 17

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

x = 5 - US
x = 17 - UT

Since US = UT, we can substitute US for UT in the second equation:

x = 17 - US
x = 17 - US
x = 17 - US

Now, we need to solve for x. Unfortunately, there isn't enough information to determine the length of RU uniquely. We know that US = UT, but we don't know the individual lengths of either US or UT. Without this information, we cannot compute the length of RU.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is none of the above choices.

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Which mathematical operation can be used to find the length of the unfenced side of the yard, given the area and the fact that one side is 10 meters?2. What formula can be applied to calculate the total perimeter of a rectangle if three sides need to be fenced and one side is given?3. Who is the subject in this problem that needs to calculate the fencing required for their yard?4. Where does the problem take place - in Alice's personal space?5. When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular parking space, marked out, three sides, unpainted side, 9 feet, sum of lengths, painted sides, 37 feet, area, square feet, Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the dimensions of the rectangular parking space?2. What is the relationship between the area of a rectangle and its dimensions?3. Who or what is responsible for marking out the rectangular parking space?4. Where is the rectangular parking space located?5. When was the rectangular parking space marked out?6. How can the information about the unpainted side and the sum of the painted sides be used to determine the dimensions of the parking space?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In the context of a rectangular parking space, it is mentioned that only three sides are painted, and the unpainted side measures 9 feet. Additionally, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. We can use this information to find the dimensions of the parking space and eventually calculate its area.

The area of a rectangle can be found using the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width. Given that the unpainted side measures 9 feet, let's call that the width (w). Now we need to find the length (l).

Since there are three painted sides, we can represent them as follows:
Length (l) + Width (w) + Length (l) = Sum of painted sides
2l + w = 37

We already know that w = 9. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:
2l + 9 = 37

Now, we can solve for l:
2l = 37 - 9
2l = 28
l = 14

Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the area of the parking space:
Area = l * w
Area = 14 * 9
Area = 126

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet, which corresponds to choice C.

Question:Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Hoses A and B, different constant rates, pool, hose A, 8 hours, first 2 hours, two hoses, 3 hours, hose B, working alone, fill the entire pool..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation represents the rate at which hose A fills the pool?2. How much of the pool did hose A fill in the first 2 hours?3. What is the combined rate of hoses A and B in filling the pool per hour?4. If hose A alone filled the pool in 8 hours, how much does hose B fill in one hour?5. In the 3-hour period where both hoses worked together, how much of the pool was left for hose B to fill alone?6. How long would it take hose B to fill the remaining portion of the pool if it worked alone?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage: The rate at which hose A fills the pool can be represented by its flow rate, which is necessary to calculate the volume of water it adds per unit time. Let's denote the rate of hose A as \( R_A \) (in cubic meters per hour). If hose A alone can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, then the pool's total volume \( V \) can be found using the formula:\[ V = R_A \times 8 \text{ hours} \]To find \( R_A \), we divide \( V \) by 8:\[ R_A = \frac{V}{8} \]For the first 2 hours, hose A fills:\[ \text{Volume filled by A in 2 hours} = R_A \times 2 \text{ hours} \]The combined rate of hoses A and B is \( R_{AB} \), which we can find by adding their individual rates if their flows are additive:\[ R_{AB} = R_A + R_B \]If hose B fills \( V \) in \( t_B \) hours when working alone, then:\[ R_B = \frac{V}{t_B} \]Given that both hoses work together for 3 hours, the amount of the pool they fill is:\[ \text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours} = R_{AB} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]The remaining volume for hose B to fill alone is the difference between the total volume and what was filled by both hoses:\[ \text{Remaining volume for B} = V - (\text{Volume filled by AB in 3 hours}) \]Finally, to find out how long it takes hose B to fill this remaining volume, we use the rate of hose B:\[ t_{B, remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume for B}}{R_B} \]By substituting the expressions for \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), we can calculate all the quantities mentioned above.

 Answer Choices: (A) 1000p (B) 1500p (C) 2000p (D) 2500p (E) 30000
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:phone manufacturer, crates, pallets, each pallet, phones, 4 crates.
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be used to find the total number of phones per crate?2. How many phones does one pallet hold?3. What is the relationship between the number of pallets and the number of phones in a crate?4. How many phones are there in 4 crates if each crate has the same number of pallets?5. Which of the answer choices represents the calculation for the total number of phones when 4 crates are shipped?6. Can you express the total number of phones using the variable p (number of pallets per crate)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the total number of phones per crate, you would need to perform an addition operation, as each crate likely contains multiple phones. The relationship between the number of phones and pallets isn't immediately clear from the given information, but let's assume that one pallet holds a fixed number of phones, say P.For example, if one pallet holds 50 phones, and there are 10 phones per crate (assuming this is the given ratio), then the calculation would be:10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate = Total phones per crateNow, to find out how many phones one pallet holds, we can rearrange the formula:P = Total phones per crate / 10If we know the total number of phones in 4 crates with the same number of pallets, we would multiply the number of phones per crate by 4:Total phones in 4 crates = 4 * (10 phones/crate * P pallets/crate)To express the total number of phones using the variable p, we can substitute the formula for the number of phones per crate into the overall equation:Total phones = 4 * (10 * p)This passage outlines the steps to calculate the total number of phones in various scenarios, using the variable p for the number of pallets per crate.

Under what circumstances would you use the order of operations (BODMAS) to solve this equation?6. How can you verify that the chosen answer (either A, B, C, D, or E) is correct for the given problem?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:When solving the equation 900 + 5 × 12, it's essential to follow the order of operations, also known as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction). According to BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, we should perform the multiplication step first.Step 1: Multiply 5 by 12.5 × 12 = 60Now that we have the result, we can proceed to the next operation.Step 2: Add this result to 900.900 + 60 = 960So, the sum of 900 and 5 times 12 is 960.The answer choice that represents the correct result of the original equation is C, which is 960.To verify the correctness of the answer, simply plug the numbers back into the equation:900 + (5 × 12) = 900 + 60 = 960Thus, the chosen answer (C) is indeed correct for the given problem, where the order of operations was used to arrive at the final result.

Answer:Let's think step by step.

Output:
Step 1: Key elements of the question:Capacity, tank, dimensions, liters.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the conversion factor between meters and liters?2. How do you calculate the volume of a rectangular prism?3. Is there any missing information in the question?4. Can you convert the dimensions of the tank from meters to liters directly?5. Do you need to convert the units of the dimensions before calculating the volume?6. How do you calculate the volume of the tank in liters?7. Does the calculated volume match any of the answer choices?
Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To calculate the capacity of a tank, we need to find its volume in liters. Since the dimensions of the tank are given in meters, we'll first need to understand the conversion factor between meters and liters. One liter is equivalent to one cubic decimeter (dm³), so there are 1000 liters in one cubic meter (m³).

Now, let's look at the dimensions of the tank:
Length (L) = 8 meters
Width (W) = 6 meters
Height (H) = 2.5 meters

To calculate the volume of a rectangular prism (like the tank), we can use the formula:
Volume = L × W × H

In our case, the volume will be:
Volume = 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m = 120 cubic meters

Since there are 1000 liters in one cubic meter, we can convert the volume to liters:
Volume (liters) = 120 m³ × 1000 liters/m³ = 120,000 liters

Now that we've calculated the volume in liters, we can compare it to the answer choices:

(A) 120 liters
(B) 1200 liters
(C) 12000 liters
(D) 120000 liters
(E) None of these

The calculated volume matches option (D), which states that the capacity of the tank is 120,000 liters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

 Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:Julie's yard, rectangular, 100 feet wide, total area, 3,000 square feet, length, other side..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is needed to find the length of the other side of the yard?2.

Where does the information about the width come from in the problem?5. In what context is the total area of 3,000 square feet relevant to Julie's yard?6. Why is it important to know both the length and width of a rectangle to determine its area?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Julie's backyard, she wanted to renovate a section by planting a garden that would cover half the yard. To find the length of the other side of the rectangular yard, she first needed to understand the relationship between the dimensions. Since the garden would take up half the yard, we can assume the yard is divided into two equal parts by this new area. If the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, which is an even number, it implies that each half must be 1,500 square feet.To calculate the length (L) of the other side, we need to know the width (W), as the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width. In this case, since the area is 1,500 square feet and one dimension (width) is unknown, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W:Width (W) = Area / Length (L)However, without knowing the width, we cannot directly find the length. The information about the width comes from the actual measurements or the problem statement. If the width were provided, we could plug it into the formula and then divide 1,500 by that value to get the length.It's important to know both the length and width of a rectangle because the area, a fundamental property of the shape, is determined by these dimensions. Knowing the area is crucial for planning purposes like Julie's garden project, as it helps her estimate the amount of plants, soil, and materials needed for the renovation. Without the complete dimensions, she might run out of space or waste resources. Therefore, to finalize her plans, Julie needs to either measure the width or be given that information to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

When does Alice need to complete this task - before planting, during landscaping, or at a specific point in time?6. Why does Alice need to know the amount of fencing? Could it be for security, privacy, or a construction project?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:In Alice's personal backyard, she faces the task of calculating the required fencing for her property. With an area known and one side measuring 10 meters, she can utilize the formula for finding the length of the unfenced side when given the area (A) of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l represents the length and w the width. By rearranging the formula to solve for the width (w), we get w = A / l. After determining the width, she can proceed to calculate the total perimeter (P) of the rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w. Since one side is already accounted for, the calculation would be P = 2 * (length of unfenced side) + 2 * (10 meters). Alice needs to complete this task before planting, ensuring her yard is properly enclosed for both security and privacy. The fence is essential for a construction project as well, as it defines the boundaries and prevents unauthorized access.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
 Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:square piece of cloth, trimmed, 4 feet, one edge, rectangular piece, cut diagonally, half, two triangles, area of each triangle, 70 square feet, perimeter, original piece of square cloth..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation does the trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represent in terms of reducing the side length of the original square?2. What is the relationship between the area of a triangle and its base and height, which helps to find the dimensions of the rectangular piece?3. Who or what determines the dimensions of the rectangle when the square cloth is trimmed?4. Where does the cutting along the diagonal occur in the transformation process, and how does it affect the shape of the resulting objects?5. When does the area of 70 square feet become relevant in the problem-solving process, and why is it significant?6. How can we use the area of the triangles to find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, considering the 4-foot reduction?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:The trimming of the cloth by 4 feet on one edge represents a reduction in the side length of the original square as an operation that corresponds to subtraction. To find the new side length after trimming, you would subtract the trimming amount from the original side. For instance, if the original side was 16 feet, the new side would be 16 - 4 = 12 feet.The relationship between the area of a triangle and its base (b) and height (h) is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area. This helps in determining the dimensions of the rectangular piece, as if you know the area and either the base or height of a triangle, you can calculate the other dimension to create a rectangle with the same area.In this context, the dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the ratio of the base to the height of the triangle formed after the diagonal cut. The diagonal of the square divides it into two congruent right triangles, and their areas together equal the area of the original square.The cutting along the diagonal occurs during the transformation process, creating two similar triangles. This transformation preserves the total area but changes the shape, turning the square into two right triangles.The area of 70 square feet becomes relevant when you consider the combined area of the two triangles created after trimming. If both triangles have the same area, you can set up an equation using the area formula for each triangle (A_triangle = 1/2 * base * height) and solve for the base or height, knowing that the total area is 70 square feet.To find the original side length of the square cloth before trimming, given the 4-foot reduction, you would first determine the area of one of the triangles. Let's say the area is A, then the area of the original square (2A) equals 70 square feet. Solving for A and using the area formula, you'd have 2A = 70, so A = 35. Since the triangles are half the area of the original square, you'd multiply the side length of one triangle (found by dividing 35 by 1/2) by 2 to get the original side length, which would be 70 feet before the trimming.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A

Question:A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
 Answer Choices: (A)  13.3542 (B)  15.8113 (C)  18.3451 (D)  19.5667 (E)  20.8888
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, sphere, diameter..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which mathematical operation connects the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter?2. What is the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid?3. Who or what determines the sphere's diameter based on the inscribed rectangular solid?4. In which geometric context does this problem take place - Euclidean space or a non-Euclidean surface?5. When inscribing a rectangular solid into a sphere, what property ensures that all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface?6. How can we calculate the sphere's diameter using the dimensions of the rectangular solid (3 x 4 x 15)?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:The problem revolves around the relationship between a rectangular solid and a sphere inscribed within it in Euclidean space. The mathematical operation connecting the dimensions of the rectangular solid to the sphere's diameter is the concept of similarity. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the longest diagonal of the solid represents the diameter of the sphere. This relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the three dimensions of the rectangular solid, which states that the square of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two dimensions (l, w, and h): d^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2.In this case, let's use the dimensions provided: l = 3 units, w = 4 units, and h = 15 units. Calculating the longest diagonal (d) gives us:d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225d^2 = 250Now, taking the square root of both sides to find the diameter:d = √250 ≈ 15.81 unitsThus, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.81 units, and it is determined by the inscribed rectangular solid's dimensions within a Euclidean context. The property that ensures all eight vertices touch the sphere's surface is known as the 'inscribed property,' which guarantees that the sphere's radius is half the length of the longest diagonal.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B

Question:A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
 Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:A paper, square form, one side (20 cm), two semi-circles, diameters, area of the remaining paper..
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation is used to find the area of the entire square paper?2. How many units does the diameter of each semi-circle measure, given that it's the same as the side of the square?3. What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which will be used for the semi-circles?4. After cutting out the semi-circles, what shape(s) remains on the paper?5. How can we subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper?6. Which answer choice represents the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:Passage:To find the area of the entire square paper, you would use the multiplication operation, as the area (A) of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length (s) by itself: A = s^2. If the side of the square measures n units, then the area would be n^2 square units.Given that the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square, which measures n units, the diameter of the semi-circle is also n units. The formula for the area of a circle (A_circle) is A_circle = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the radius of the semi-circle (r) is half of n, so r = n/2. Thus, the area of one semi-circle is A_semi = π(n/2)^2 = πn^2/4.After cutting out the semi-circles, the remaining shape on the paper is a rectangle, formed by the square with two quarter-circle cutouts. To find the area of this remaining rectangle (A_remaining), you subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square. So, A_remaining = A_square - 2 * A_semi.Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:A_remaining = n^2 - 2 * (πn^2/4)Simplifying this expression gives us:A_remaining = n^2 - (πn^2/2)A_remaining = n^2 * (1 - π/2)Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the semi-circles is n^2 * (1 - π/2) square units, where n represents the side length of the square in units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Question:[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
 Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 4.5 (C) 5 (D) 5.5 (E) 6.5
Answer:Let's think step by step:

Step 1:Key elements of the question:[5, ?, 19, 15, 7, 13, 13, 156].
Step 2:Decompose the question into new questions:1. Which operation should be performed first in the equation to find the missing value?2. What is the result of 5 plus the unknown number before any other operations are applied?3. How many times does the unknown number need to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5?4. In the expression [5 + ? × 19], what value of the unknown would make the entire expression equal to 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7?5. At what position does the factor 13 appear in the denominator of the equation, and how does it contribute to the overall calculation?6. To solve for the unknown, what algebraic manipulation must be done to isolate the variable after simplifying the equation using the given numbers?
Step 3:Analyzing these new questions can inferr that:To determine the missing values and the sequence of operations, let's break down the given equations step by step.Firstly, to find the missing value that should be performed first in the equation, we need to consider the order of operations. According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, in the expression [5 + ? × 19], you should perform the multiplication by 19 before adding it to 5.Moving on to the second question, if we simply add 5 to the unknown number without any other operations, let's denote the unknown as \( x \). The result would be \( 5 + x \).For the third question, if the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to yield a certain value when combined with 5, we can set up an equation: \( 19x + 5 = \text{certain value} \). To find out how many times the unknown number needs to be multiplied by 19 to reach this value, we would need to know the specific value and then divide it by 19.Now, for the fourth question, if the expression [5 + ? × 19] equals 6 after the subtraction of 15 and 7, we can write the equation as follows: \( (5 + x \times 19) - 15 - 7 = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we first simplify by subtracting 15 and 7 from the expression and then dividing by 19 to isolate \( x \).Lastly, regarding the position of the factor 13 in the denominator, let's say the equation is \( \frac{\text{unknown}}{a/b + 13} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. To find the position of 13, we need to see if it's part of the denominator directly or if it's multiplied by another term. If it's in the denominator itself, it would be at the second position contributing to the division.To isolate the variable in the last algebraic manipulation, we would first combine like terms and then multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate any fractions, if necessary.In summary, the order of operations suggests multiplying by 19 first, followed by adding 5. The unknown number's contribution to the certain value depends on the specific value provided. To find the unknown in the expression [5 + ? × 19], we need to simplify and isolate the variable using the given numbers and equation. The factor 13's position and role in the denominator would depend on the actual equation structure.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C

Step 1: Key elements of the question:cube, sphere, volume, ratio.
Step 2: Decompose the question into new questions:1. What is the definition of the volume of a cube?2. What is the definition of the volume of a sphere?3. What is the relationship between the side length of the cube and the diameter of the sphere inscribed in it?4. Can we express the ratio of the volumes of the cube and the sphere using the side length of the cube and the diameter of the sphere?5. Is there a way to simplify the ratio using basic mathematical principles and relationships?6. Which answer choice corresponds to the simplified ratio?

Step 3: Analyzing these new questions can infer that:
1. The volume of a cube is defined as the product of the lengths of its sides cubed, V_cube = s^3, where s is the side length of the cube.
2. The volume of a sphere is defined as (4/3) * pi * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
3. The diameter of a sphere inscribed in a cube is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, d_sphere = s_cube.
4. Yes, we can express the ratio of the volumes of the cube and the sphere using their respective formulas and the relationship between the side length of the cube and the diameter of the sphere. The ratio of the volumes would be: Ratio(V_cube : V_sphere) = s_cube^3 / ((4/3) * pi * (s_cube/2)^3)
5. Simplifying the ratio by canceling out the common factors and applying the power rule for exponents results in: Ratio(V_cube : V_sphere) = 1 / (4/3 * pi * (1/2)^3) = 3 * pi / 4
6. Among the answer choices, only D (6:pi) corresponds to the simplified ratio.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.
