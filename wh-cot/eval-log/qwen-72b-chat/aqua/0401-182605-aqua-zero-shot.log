Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
B. Let's reason about the multi-choice question.
The key relation here is that for any two integers x and y, their product equals the product of their GCF and their LCM: xy = GCF(x,y)*LCM(x,y). Thus, if we let x=350 and y be the integer we're looking for, then 350*y = 11*7700, from which it follows that y=242.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
The correct answer is (D). To have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant b^2 - 4ac must be greater than zero. In this case, we have a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. So, we need (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) > 0, or 25 - 4k > 0. Solving for k, we get that k < 25/4, which is approximately 6.25. The largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, so the answer is (D).

Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We refer to Wikipedia articles on elementary mathematics for help. Let's solve this problem step by step. To maximize the total number of students, we want to have as many students studying each subject as possible. To minimize the total number of students, we want to have as few students studying each subject as possible. We know that the fraction of students studying each subject cannot exceed 1/10, so there must be at least 100 students in the class. Thus, the maximum number of students is 100 + 100 + 125 = 325, and the minimum number of students is 100 + 100 + 125 = 325. Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 325 - 325 = 0.

Therefore, the answer is (A).

Question:The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
(C) 41. 

To solve this problem, we need to find five consecutive two-digit odd numbers whose sum is divisible by 10 and is also a perfect square. Let's start by listing the first few odd numbers greater than or equal to 10:

11, 13, 15, 17, 19

We can see that these numbers are already in ascending order and are all odd. Therefore, if we add 2 to each number, we will get the next set of five consecutive odd numbers:

13, 15, 17, 19, 21

If we continue this pattern, we can see that the next set of five consecutive odd numbers would be:

15, 17, 19, 21, 23

And so on.

Now, let's check which of these sets satisfies the condition that their sum is a perfect square when divided by 10. We can use modulo arithmetic to help us with this task. Since we want the sum to be divisible by 10, we know that the last digit of the sum must be either 0 or 5. 

Let's consider the set {13, 15, 17, 19, 21}. The sum of these numbers is:

13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 = 85

The sum is not divisible by 10, so we can eliminate this set.

Next, let's consider the set {15, 17, 19, 21, 23}. The sum of these numbers is:

15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 = 95

Again, the sum is not divisible by 10, so we can eliminate this set as well.

Continuing this process, we can check that none of the other sets satisfy the condition that their sum is a perfect square when divided by 10.

However, if we go back to the original set of five consecutive odd numbers greater than or equal to 10, we can see that they do satisfy the condition. Their sum is:

11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 75

When we divide 75 by 10, we get 7.5, which is not a perfect square. However, if we multiply it by 2, we get 15, which is a perfect square. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 41, since 41 is one of the original five consecutive odd numbers greater than or equal to 10.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
We can start with answer choice D, which is 1.
If the coin diver only retrieved 1 copper coin, then she would have earned at most 20 cents from it. To reach a total of $3.40, she must have retrieved additional brass coins. Let's say she retrieved x brass coins. The total amount of money she would have earned from the brass coins is 25x cents.
Therefore, we have the equation 20 + 25x = 340.
Solving for x, we get x = 12.
So, if the coin diver retrieved 1 copper coin and 12 brass coins, she would have earned a total of $3.40.
Since this satisfies the condition given in the question, the answer is D, which is 1.

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
B. To find out how many toys Jacob made, we need to know how many toys Alex made. Let's assume that Alex made x toys and Jacob made y toys. We know that x + y = 35, so y = 35 - x. We also know that it takes Alex 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob 9 hours to make a toy, so the total number of hours they worked is 7x + 9y. Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can say that 7x + 9y is approximately equal to the total number of hours they could have worked if they had each made 35 toys, which is 245. Therefore, we have the equation 7x + 9(35 - x) ≈ 245. Solving this equation gives us x ≈ 20, so Jacob made y = 35 - x = 15 toys. Therefore, the answer is B.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
The correct answer is (A). To solve this problem, you can set up an equation using percentages. Let x be the original price of the product. After a 30% reduction, the new price is 0.7x. To find the percentage increase needed to make the price 100% of the original price, you can use the following equation: (new price / original price) = (1 + percentage increase / 100). Plugging in the values from the problem, you get: (0.7x / x) = (1 + percentage increase / 100). Solving for percentage increase, you get: percentage increase = ((1 - 0.7) * 100) = 30%. Therefore, the price must be increased by 30% to make it 100% of the original price. The closest answer choice among A through E is (A), which is 41.86%.

To find the population of the city after 2 years with an annual increase of 5%, we need to calculate the population at the end of each year and add the percentage increase to find the new population.
Year 1:
Population = 78000
Increase = 78000 * 5% = 3900
New Population = 78000 + 3900 = 81900

Year 2:
Population = 81900
Increase = 81900 * 5% = 4095
New Population = 81900 + 4095 = 85995

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
E. None of these.

To find the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500, we can set up an equation:

$1500 = $500 + 0.05 * Sales

Subtracting $500 from both sides gives:

$1000 = 0.05 * Sales

Dividing both sides by 0.05 gives:

Sales = $20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 in order for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. This option is not among the given choices, hence the correct answer is E. None of these.

Question:A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Answer: Among A through E, the answer is
Output:
 Choice D. Rs. 8.

To find the manufactured cost of each pen, we need to use the following information:

* The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler.
* On average, 10% of the produced pens are defective and rejected before packing.
* The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%.

Let's assume that the manufactured cost of each pen is x rupees. Then, the total revenue from selling 7200 pens to the wholesaler would be 7200 \* 10 = 72,000 rupees.
However, since 10% of the pens are defective and rejected, the actual number of pens sold to the wholesaler is only 90% of the promised quantity, i.e., 7200 \* 0.9 = 6480 pens.
The company makes a profit of 25% on the manufactured cost of each pen. Therefore, the revenue from selling 6480 pens to the wholesaler should be equal to the manufactured cost of 6480 pens plus 25% of the manufactured cost of 6480 pens:
72,000 = 6480x + 0.25 \* 6480x
Simplifying this equation gives us:
72,000 = 8100x
x = 7200 / 8100 = 0.9
Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is 7200 / 7200 = 1 rupee per pen. However, since the company sells each pen for 10 rupees, the profit made on each pen is 10 - 1 = 9 rupees.
Thus, the correct answer is Choice D. Rs. 8.

Answer: Among A through E, the answer is

We can find the value of m by substituting the root 1.5 into the quadratic equation and solving for m.
x^2 + mx + 22 = 0
(1.5)^2 + 1.5m + 22 = 0
2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0
1.5m = -24.25
m = -24.25 / 1.5
m = -16.2
